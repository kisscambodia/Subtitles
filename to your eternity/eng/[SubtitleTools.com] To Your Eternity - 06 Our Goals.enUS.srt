1
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,110
The escape from the Yanome prison

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,050
brought about an unexpected situation.

3
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,840
March's death.

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,030
It was the second human death
that Fushi had witnessed,

5
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,440
and it became a source of new stimulation.

6
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:36,600
Through its encounter
with this mother, March,

7
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,260
Fushi became ever so
slightly more human-like.

8
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:49,590
Left with only her lingering
scent, it set off.

9
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,990
Fushi walked, seeking more stimulation.

10
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:36,500
It spent most of its time in the wolf's form.

11
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,770
This helped it choose its
next destination by smell.

12
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,950
It didn't take the bear's form.

13
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,760
In that form, it felt unrelenting pain.

14
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,170
At times, it took the boy's form,

15
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,060
but there was little reason to.

16
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,830
When it became hungry,
it would take on March's form.

17
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:14,260
That way, it could climb
the fruit trees with ease.

18
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:26,620
And then, it came across a familiar scent.

19
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,930
Our Goals

20
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,710
You're alive?!

21
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,710
You have no idea what I've been through!

22
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,510
I was lost for three days and nights,

23
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,640
I had to ask villagers for food to stay alive,

24
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,350
I tried to give the donkeys water
and they ran away on me,

25
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,990
and I spent all this time here,
hiding from the rain and wind!

26
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,170
That girl... Parona, was it?
She's not with you?

27
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,740
And that monster, Fushi.

28
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,640
Hey, say something!

29
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,800
Oh, it was you?

30
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,270
No wonder you're so quiet.

31
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:34,520
Either way, you're the only other one here.

32
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,040
Where are you going?

33
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,920
Hey!

34
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,140
Don't leave an elder all by herself!

35
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:53,420
I don't have the slightest
sense of what you're thinking.

36
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,810
What goes through your head
when you take on March's form?

37
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:03,850
Do monsters have feelings
or think about things?

38
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:09,010
I can see that if you do, you don't
have the means to express any of it.

39
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,980
I'd like to get a look
inside your mind one day.

40
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,500
I'm so hungry...

41
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,300
I haven't had anything to eat in two days.

42
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,330
Hey, let's take a break.

43
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,750
Water...

44
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,920
Meat...

45
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,230
Thigh meat!

46
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,560
It's not like you'll lose anything!

47
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,560
Let me cook it!

48
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,680
Be good to your elders!

49
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,170
Get over here!

50
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,150
You monster!

51
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,980
I'm begging you! Give me some!

52
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,590
I can't go on any longer!

53
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,610
Yum.

54
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,830
Yum. Yum.

55
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,760
"Thank you"?

56
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,640
Thank you, thank you.

57
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,170
What a good girl.

58
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,540
It's a map.

59
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,580
What's this?

60
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,320
There's a town!

61
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,160
Though it's 100 ri away.

62
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,710
We could also walk toward the sea.

63
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,790
What do you think, Fushi?

64
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,800
My hometown is beyond the sea.

65
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,440
Shall we go?

66
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,680
What...

67
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,810
Are you interested in writing?

68
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:46,240
Look. This is how you write "ri."

69
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,970
That's it.

70
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,860
Want to learn more?

71
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,530
Then come with me.

72
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:18,250
I'll teach you all about words and
writing and living as a human being.

73
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,760
And you take better care of me.

74
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:30,580
This says "March."

75
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,280
No, not like that.

76
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,510
Like this.

77
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,660
This says "Fushi."

78
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,000
That's you.

79
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,760
"Parona."

80
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,390
This is my name.

81
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,830
"Pioran."

82
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,870
That's a "tree."

83
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,150
Those are "flowers."

84
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,270
Bird.

85
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,950
Sun.

86
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,920
Yum!

87
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:19,930
River.

88
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,680
River.

89
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,200
Fish.

90
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,640
Fire.

91
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,010
Fish.

92
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,060
Fire.

93
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,930
Thank you.

94
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,780
Thank you.

95
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:46,120
That's not wrong, but there's a
better word for this situation.

96
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,870
"Yum"!

97
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,030
Yuf!

98
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,210
Yum.

99
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,340
Yum.

100
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,510
Goodnight.

101
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,580
Goodnight.

102
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,690
What's that?

103
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,700
That's a boat.

104
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,240
Fish.

105
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,740
Fruit.

106
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,520
Yup.

107
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:59,120
You sure have learned how
to say lots of things, huh?

108
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,980
I have.

109
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,450
Do you think that's thanks to March?

110
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:09,510
To grow up is to learn.

111
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,440
Oh?

112
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,960
You want to become a grown-up?

113
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:18,510
Say, where were you before you met March?

114
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:22,350
What did you do? Who were you with?

115
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,350
I walked all by myself.

116
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:31,360
Then I met him.

117
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,860
He gave me food.

118
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,380
Who?

119
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,310
Who did you meet?

120
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,230
I don't know.

121
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:43,110
I don't know his name.

122
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:49,130
Shapes, sounds, smells... I remember.

123
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,780
I became that person.

124
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,350
The end.

125
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,150
We're coming up on land!

126
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,550
See how the sky is red over there?

127
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,420
The Yanome fight like that every day.

128
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,100
With Takunaha, where we're about to go now.

129
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:27,490
My lover's home is that way.

130
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,250
We'll go there first.

131
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,570
Let's rest in this forest for the night.

132
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,910
He's an intellectual.

133
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:40,490
He might know something about you.

134
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,860
We'll be there by the end of tomorrow.

135
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,300
What's this?

136
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:05,240
It seems someone's come
to play in my garden.

137
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:32,180
Its flesh responds differently than usual.

138
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,630
It tries to take on the form
of the boy, but to no avail.

139
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,820
What is it, Fushi?

140
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,550
Is something the matter?

141
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,510
Wh-What are you?!

142
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,740
Why do you look like Fushi?

143
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,730
What do you want from us?!

144
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:47,000
Though your flesh may be immobile,
surely you can hear my voice.

145
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:48,670
Well?

146
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,000
How does it feel to have
lost part of yourself?

147
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,620
It took a piece of you.

148
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,690
That boy.

149
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,530
His shape. His sound. His scent.

150
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:07,770
As it stands, you can't recall what
it was that it took from you.

151
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:13,520
But you must have noticed that
emptiness, that discomfort.

152
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,670
Is that over there of value to you?

153
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,550
I'll give you some advice that's
suited for your intellect.

154
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,790
That is your enemy.

155
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,280
Fight it, and win.

156
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,360
There's a core in its midsection.

157
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,260
Rip that core out of its flesh.

158
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,860
That will stop it from moving.

159
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,190
Not bad.

160
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,880
Fushi!

161
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,100
Don't come.

162
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,050
That steals the vessels
that you've collected.

163
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:49,790
It's designed with the
objective of weakening you.

164
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,290
It's a failure of life,
incapable of becoming an animal.

165
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:03,570
But it's adept at stealing.

166
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,310
Well done.

167
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,140
That's the core.

168
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:48,420
Inside it is everything it stole from you.

169
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,700
All that's left is to take it back.

170
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:25,480
What are you?

171
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,260
I am your maker.

172
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:34,970
We have a grand objective.

173
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,710
To preserve this world.

174
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:46,560
And this entity was sent to this
world to impede our objective.

175
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,950
It seems you don't understand.

176
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,300
That's fine.

177
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,680
I'll come to speak with you again.

178
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,960
Well, Fushi, we shall have fun.

179
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,370
Until the coming end.

180
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,790
Hey!

181
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,930
Are you all right, Fushi?

182
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,860
What was that thing?

183
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,490
Fushi?

184
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,850
I don't know.

185
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,610
That was weird.

186
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,780
Hey! Where's the old man?!

187
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:53,270
Be grateful! Pioran here
has brought a gift for you!

188
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,510
An immortal freak!

189
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:34,480
Preview

190
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:37,740
Fushi and Pioran begin a new
life at the old brewer's home.

191
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:44,630
The masked boy, Gugu,
welcomes Fushi with cheer.

192
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:53,300
And Fushi's presence brings
about change in Gugu himself.

193
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:58,430
