1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:04,590
From Ninannah to Yanome,

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:12,720
both along the way and after their arrival,
Fushi continued to receive stimulation.

3
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:20,580
And he completed the first task in his
process of growth: becoming aware.

4
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:28,810
He became a captive along
with March, Parona, and Pioran,

5
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,970
and so gained consciousness.

6
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,970
He began acting on his own accord
with a desire to change.

7
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,660
And again, Fushi received more stimulation.

8
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:53,110
What effect will all the information
he gathers have on him?

9
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,550
Let's go home, March.

10
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,850
Those Who Follow

11
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,430
You, too, ma'am.

12
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,910
We'll have her guide us to Ninannah.

13
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,840
Bye-bye, Mister Bear.

14
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,840
This sewer will take us close
to the room with the wagon.

15
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,530
Ma'am, take March there with you.

16
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,520
This is the key for the room.

17
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,030
What about Sissy?

18
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,480
She's got work to do.

19
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,490
Let's go.

20
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,980
Don't!

21
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,740
What are you doing, Sissy?!

22
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,060
Don't!

23
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,350
I'm just cutting off a bit to take home.

24
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,930
We'll take it home to Ninannah
and tell the people in the village

25
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,480
that Oniguma is dead and we
don't need the ritual anymore.

26
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,970
You can't cut him up! That's awful!

27
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,310
Awful?

28
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,340
March, this thing's already dead.

29
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,330
It's about to be burned to ashes.

30
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,240
But I'd feel bad for him!

31
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,110
I know.

32
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,210
March, let's play a game.

33
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,840
You go on with the old lady.

34
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,540
As a reward, I'll give you this.

35
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:37,690
Ta-da!

36
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,430
A fluffy puppy!

37
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,940
March, please, do as I say just this once.

38
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,220
If we can prove that Oniguma is dead,

39
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,870
no more children will have to die.

40
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,790
No one else will have to
go through what you did.

41
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,560
But this bear isn't Oniguma.

42
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,310
Let's think of it this way, then.

43
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:15,820
The bear died to save poor
little girls like you.

44
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:20,000
It died so that we don't have
to do the ritual anymore.

45
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,000
That's selfish!

46
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,940
He's just a big, scary bear!

47
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,540
It's not his problem!

48
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,290
That's not true.

49
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,220
You just don't understand
because you're still a child.

50
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,520
Please don't look at me like that.

51
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,520
Why are you smiling?

52
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,600
I just...

53
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,150
All right, March.

54
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,490
I won't do it.

55
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,800
Let's go.

56
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,020
How are we going to convince the villagers?

57
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,950
I don't think they'll listen to us.

58
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,550
I'll make it happen.

59
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,670
I'm going to prove that we don't need
to make use of another life to do it.

60
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,390
Yay! We escaped!

61
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,760
We're going to barge right through the city.

62
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,620
We're going home to Ninannah.

63
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,810
I'm so happy.

64
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,970
I get to see Mommy and Daddy again.

65
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,760
Do you think they'll be happy when
they find out I'm still alive?

66
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,080
Of course they will, March.

67
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,620
You're a terrible driver.

68
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,460
Should I take over?

69
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,060
This is a thank-you meal.

70
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,780
I want to give it to Sissy later.

71
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,990
It's a big secret.

72
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,590
What's a big secret?

73
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,140
Oh, nothing.

74
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,290
All right.

75
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,130
Hey, what do you want to do
when you become a grown-up?

76
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,320
Well...

77
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,590
I want to do everything a grown-up can.

78
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,440
First, I want to cook.

79
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,210
How else can I become a mommy?

80
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,530
And then, when I have kids,

81
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,450
I want to make them stuffed
dolls like you do.

82
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,820
And I want to learn more words
and learn how to write.

83
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,560
Maybe Ninannah can have its own writing.

84
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,440
I just want to learn
everything I don't know.

85
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,100
Growing up means knowing everything, right?

86
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,440
Of course, that means you, too, Fu-chan.

87
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,710
You're going to learn with
me and grow up with me.

88
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,290
I'm certain your wish will come true, March.

89
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,590
Sissy!

90
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,940
I'm fine.

91
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,640
This is a game, too.

92
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,180
We win by getting home without being caught.

93
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,990
Leave the dog behind,
and I'll spare your lives.

94
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,090
No!

95
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,000
I refuse!

96
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,950
Come!

97
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,040
I'll kick you off.

98
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,590
No, Sissy! It's dangerous!

99
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,560
They'll kill you!

100
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:56,990
What's going on?

101
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,430
Is something the matter?

102
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,930
Keep going, please.

103
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,530
Stay back, March.

104
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,480
Don't go, Sissy!

105
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,620
What should I do?

106
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,500
What do I do?

107
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,640
I can do something, too.

108
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,480
That's it.

109
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,390
Come, dog.

110
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,170
I'm so hungry, I'm going to die, Mommy.

111
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,110
Oh, you poor thing.

112
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,370
Mommy will make you something to eat.

113
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,380
Cook, cook, cook the food...

114
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,640
Yum.

115
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,700
That's my mommy.

116
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,450
You're so good at cooking.

117
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,590
Oh, you poor thing.

118
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,840
Mommy will make you something to eat.

119
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,170
Cook, cook, cook the food...

120
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,310
Oh, my, you poor thing.

121
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,560
Daddy's coming home early
today, so we'll have a feast.

122
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,060
Cook, cook, cook the food...

123
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,540
Hey, why are you always by yourself?

124
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,430
Um...

125
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,190
I don't have a family.

126
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,490
Oh, yeah.

127
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,930
This is for you.

128
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,870
Wait here!

129
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,020
Here!

130
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,790
This is a thank-you meal!

131
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,550
Thank you...

132
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,610
Munch, munch, munch.

133
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,520
Mm, it's so good.

134
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,200
Hey, why don't we become a family?

135
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,910
This will be our child.

136
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,130
I'm Mommy, and you're Daddy!

137
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,100
March!

138
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,850
March!

139
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,400
March!

140
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,010
March!

141
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,810
March!

142
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,420
March!

143
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,430
March!

144
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,990
Sissy...

145
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,090
It's okay.

146
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,970
It's okay, March.

147
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,810
I'll fix you up right away.

148
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,740
Am I gonna... d-die for you, Sissy?

149
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,670
You won't die, March.

150
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,740
You're going back to the
village to become a grown-up.

151
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:14,600
This is for you, Sissy.

152
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,250
It's a thank-you meal.

153
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,690
Sissy...

154
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:33,150
Become a... m-mommy in my place.

155
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,810
No!

156
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,580
That's your dream!

157
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,890
You have to become a mommy.

158
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,500
Isn't that right, March?

159
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,460
Right?

160
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:50,970
Yeah.

161
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,740
There, all done.

162
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,700
You'll be okay now.

163
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,700
Now we just need to get back home.

164
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,100
Sissy...

165
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:10,160
Is Fu-chan there?

166
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,630
Yeah, he is.

167
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,620
Thank good...ness.

168
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,280
This looks yummy.

169
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:10,190
You always make the best food.

170
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,590
Fire!

171
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,440
What the hell is that?

172
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,500
It's Oniguma-sama!

173
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,450
Oniguma-sama is angry!

174
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,290
Fire!

175
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,340
Fushi...

176
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,440
Thank you.

177
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,500
You're fighting for March, aren't you?

178
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,550
But it's okay now.

179
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,540
There's no need to do that anymore.

180
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:54,030
Sorry I'm always working so late, March.

181
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,150
But today's special.

182
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,450
I'll be done with work early today.

183
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:07,100
Let's go home together.

184
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,620
March!

185
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,740
Is that you, March?

186
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,000
That's right!

187
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,950
Can you believe it?

188
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,680
I'm alive!

189
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,380
I went through so much!

190
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,820
You're amazing, March.

191
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,820
Good girl.

192
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:37,260
I'm so hungry, I could die, Mommy!

193
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,060
Oh, you poor things.

194
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,900
Mommy will make you something to eat.

195
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,120
Let's see, how many do I have to feed?

196
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,050
I have...

197
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,760
One, two, three, four...

198
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:53,920
Huh?

199
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,680
Fu-chan?

200
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,050
Where am I?

201
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,260
That's right.

202
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,220
I'm not...

203
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,910
Let's go home together.

204
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,390
Sissy...

205
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,230
Fu-chan...

206
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,730
Sissy!

207
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,560
I'm right here!

208
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,270
I'm here!

209
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,330
No! No! No!

210
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,990
I don't want to die!

211
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,450
I'm right here!

212
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,480
I'm not dead!

213
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,150
There's so much I still want to do!

214
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,740
I haven't done anything yet!

215
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,990
It's all right, March.

216
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,720
Just wait.

217
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,550
I'll be right there with you.

218
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:35,610
I'm not tough enough to go
on living with this reality.

219
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,050
No! Sissy! No!

220
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,380
Don't die!

221
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,810
Fu-chan! Stop her!

222
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,150
Help Sissy!

223
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,060
Don't!

224
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,440
Over there!

225
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,420
Capture him while he's in human form!

226
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:26,140
You're telling me I have to live on anyway?

227
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,750
You're horrible.

228
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,560
Parona.

229
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,310
Is that...

230
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,820
It couldn't be... Oniguma-sama?

231
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,790
Parona-chan!

232
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,370
We were all looking for you.

233
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,370
Where were you this whole time?

234
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,530
What have you been doing
for the past half a year?

235
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,410
Nothing.

236
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,030
There was nothing I could do.

237
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,980
Oh... I have to give this to you.

238
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,180
She left a letter with me.

239
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,770
A letter?

240
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,470
A sheet of paper marked with words.

241
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,220
It's just a hand print.

242
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,920
This is what it says:

243
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,730
"March is doing great."

244
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,660
How could this be?

245
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:27,620
I'm her father. I should have protected her.

246
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,500
I'm so sorry.

247
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:42,670
Thank you for all you've done for March.

248
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,920
Hey! The Yanome are coming!

249
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,490
The Yanome?

250
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:13,640
What for?

251
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,220
They must be coming for you.

252
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,010
Run, Fushi.

253
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,810
Avoid their scent.

254
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,880
Your life isn't something given to you.

255
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,570
It's for you to win for yourself!

256
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,480
You understand what I'm saying, right?

257
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,320
Where are they?

258
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,420
Over there.

259
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,410
They're close.

260
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,420
They've found Fushi.

261
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,650
We'll have to slow them down.

262
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,760
I only have a strong, heavy one.

263
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,340
That'll do.

264
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,230
You got her!

265
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,060
No.

266
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,190
I missed.

267
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,590
I missed.

268
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:18,440
In meeting its mother and parting
with her, its humanity increased.

269
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,220
No, it hadn't parted with her.

270
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:26,730
It set out on a journey with her.

271
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,120
Fushi is reunited with Pioran.

272
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:51,010
Preview

273
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:38,720
She instructs him in the use of words
and living as a human being.

274
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,660
They travel together,

275
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:46,080
but they are attacked by something unknown.

276
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:53,410
Thus begins a battle with an enemy
that threatens Fushi's life.

277
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:55,010
Our Goals
