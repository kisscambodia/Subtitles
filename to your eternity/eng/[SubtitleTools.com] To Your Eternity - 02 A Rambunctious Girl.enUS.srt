1
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,560
It walked southward.

2
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:15,570
It gathered knowledge,
and through stimulation,

3
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,000
it could replicate that information.

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,850
A rock...

5
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,070
A wolf...

6
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,330
And then, a human being.

7
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,220
Because it possessed none of the
things that make humans human,

8
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:40,210
it soiled itself and failed to
procure sufficient nourishment.

9
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,710
And so, it died quickly.

10
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,940
To this object, death is
but a change in state.

11
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:59,350
It had died six times so far, but it
regenerated, as expected, each time.

12
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,180
The first time, it took five whole days,

13
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:08,250
but by the sixth time, it could
accomplish it in roughly twelve hours.

14
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,250
Pain promotes growth.

15
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,670
No death is wasted.

16
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,900
It died again.

17
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,360
But that was not a problem.

18
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,620
Mommy, I'm so hungry, I could die!

19
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,680
Oh, Usajiro, you poor baby!

20
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,950
Mommy will make you something right away.

21
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,120
There you go. Eat up.

22
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,350
Yummy!

23
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,370
Thank you, Mommy!

24
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,040
You're so good at cooking!

25
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,510
Oh, my, thank you!

26
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,770
Congratulations, Lee.

27
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,250
You're a full-fledged adult now, eh?

28
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,500
Thanks, Grandma.

29
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,510
What are you looking at, March?

30
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,630
Ta-da!

31
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,810
What's this?

32
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,710
We had another baby?!

33
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:15,840
That's right.

34
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,640
Our sixth child, Kanitaro!

35
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,590
I've been wanting another child!

36
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,930
Now we're a family of eight!

37
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,910
That's right.

38
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,330
Here, darling! Eat this feast
I made to thank you!

39
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,330
Wow, this looks delicious!

40
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,250
You always make the best food, honey.

41
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,350
Aren't you glad you married me?

42
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,460
Time to eat, March.

43
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,420
Daddy! Mommy!

44
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,860
Look! Kanitaro!

45
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,380
She made a new one, eh? Very nice.

46
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,800
Thank you for looking after her
all the time, Parona-chan.

47
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,410
Not at all.

48
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,320
Being around March comforts me.

49
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:02,390
Hey, Mommy, when do I get to be a grown-up?

50
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,520
That question again?

51
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,700
Once you stop wetting the bed,
then sleep 3,000 times more.

52
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,040
That's what I always tell you.

53
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,780
I can't wait that long!

54
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,910
I wanna grow up so I can be a mommy!

55
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,680
Did you know? Lee-chan next
door isn't a child anymore!

56
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,860
They took the ink off her face!

57
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,960
The only children left in this village
are me, Lisa, and little Lalah!

58
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,670
It's so humiliating!

59
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,200
There, there, Lisa.

60
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,900
Let me feed you some of my milk.

61
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,380
Stop that.

62
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,690
Let me tell you a secret, March.

63
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,810
Now, listen. You can't become
a grown-up if you don't behave.

64
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,230
Hush up to grow up!

65
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,770
What?! That's so silly!

66
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:50,530
A Rambunctious Girl

67
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,550
That bow is too strong and heavy for you.

68
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,110
Don't worry. You'll get
better at it eventually.

69
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,960
We'll help you out.

70
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,450
Let's hang in there and keep practicing.

71
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,850
Thanks.

72
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,820
Hey, where's Daddy?

73
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,770
Where's Daddy?

74
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,360
Daddy's busy with work.

75
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,800
Aw, but...

76
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,340
Now, don't be selfish!

77
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,840
What's that sound?

78
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,380
I don't know.

79
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,400
March!

80
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,460
Sissy!

81
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,900
Where are we going?

82
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,420
I found a nice spot.

83
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,340
Let's go play there today.

84
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,180
What do you think you're doing?

85
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,800
That girl is from the village, is she not?

86
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,480
Did you not hear the order to assemble?

87
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,490
Rejoice, everyone.

88
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,260
Your village was fortunate enough
to be chosen this year.

89
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:28,370
The ritual of gratitude to Oniguma-sama,
the god who brings peace

90
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,770
and prosperity to the Ninannah region,

91
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,020
will be held in this village.

92
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,520
In accordance with tradition,
we, the Yanome people,

93
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,700
will choose an untarnished girl
to offer to Oniguma-sama.

94
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,900
Let's see...

95
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,410
This is the one.

96
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,090
Congratulations, March!

97
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:17,770
Congratulations!

98
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:18,810
Congratulations!

99
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,220
Thank you.

100
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,920
Thank you.

101
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,320
Why are they congratulating
me? What happened?

102
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,560
You were chosen for a great honor.

103
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,570
Honor?

104
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,090
We're so sorry, March!

105
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,260
What's wrong, Mommy?

106
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,130
You are going to die.

107
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,030
March-san.

108
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:51,300
You are to be sacrificed to Oniguma-sama.

109
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,790
For all of our sakes.

110
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,300
Sacrificed?

111
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,220
My name is Hayase.

112
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,890
I have been ordered to look after
you until the ritual is complete.

113
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,300
Move back, please.

114
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,390
No men may come near her.

115
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,610
We must not allow her to be tarnished.

116
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,480
Here is the schedule.

117
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:18,300
On the day before we leave,
the village will hold a banquet.

118
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,650
The family is asked to say
their goodbyes at this time.

119
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,890
We will then spend three days
climbing the mountain.

120
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:31,580
You two may rest assured
that we will travel safely.

121
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,230
March-san will sleep on the
altar atop the mountain.

122
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,300
We will return down the mountain
before Oniguma-sama arrives.

123
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:44,150
In one year, we will retrieve
anything that remains on the altar

124
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,020
and bring it home to the parents.

125
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,590
I don't wanna die, though!

126
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,860
If I die, I can't become a grown-up, right?

127
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,850
That would be the case.

128
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:58,060
So I don't want to die!

129
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,160
That is unfortunate.

130
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,290
Why do you get to decide what happens to me?!

131
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,920
That is the tradition.

132
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,180
What?! That doesn't make sense!

133
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,460
No! No! No!

134
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,840
I don't want to die!

135
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,600
Why do I have to die?!

136
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Why don't I get to become a grown-up?!

137
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Tell me! Why?! Why?! Why?!

138
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,320
March!

139
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,610
Behave.

140
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,860
March-chan, eat this.

141
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,100
Eat this, too.

142
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,370
Lalah.

143
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,870
I made this, March.

144
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,310
Wear it on your last day.

145
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,380
Thanks.

146
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,320
I'll do my best.

147
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:05,540
Is your job to watch me go to the bathroom?

148
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:10,780
I am watching over you until the final day
to ensure you remain in pristine condition.

149
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,280
You're making sure I don't run away.

150
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,720
Allow me to warn you: if you run away,

151
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,770
Lalah will die in your place.

152
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,900
And if Lalah runs away?

153
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,870
We will choose the one who can't run away.

154
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,110
Oh, dear. What's wrong?

155
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,120
There, there.

156
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,070
There, there.

157
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,930
You have been very strong.

158
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,810
You are behaving well.

159
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:32,940
I'm impressed.

160
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:39,460
There is a legend that says freedom
awaits in the world after death.

161
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:42,500
You can do anything and become anything.

162
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:46,960
There, you can become the grown-up
that you could not become here.

163
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,360
An arrow...

164
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,410
She got away!

165
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:09,880
Hold it!

166
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,690
Hayase-sama!

167
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,480
After March!

168
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,620
Don't lose her!

169
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,110
She disappeared?

170
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,260
Search over there!

171
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:40,580
She's not here!

172
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,940
Search harder!

173
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,820
I'm sorry, Daddy.

174
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,530
I couldn't behave.

175
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,980
There she is! It's March!

176
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,300
What is that?!

177
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,720
W-Wait for me!

178
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,250
What?

179
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,790
What is this?

180
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,470
U-Um...

181
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,600
Where are you going?

182
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,190
Take me with you!

183
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,850
I see.

184
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,190
You were going to fake March-san's death.

185
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:57,480
I see what you were trying to do,
but it was like a child playing pretend.

186
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:03,990
Do not misunderstand.
I will not be the one to punish you.

187
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,530
It will be your own people of Ninannah.

188
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,480
Where's March?

189
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,240
Well...

190
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,670
You let her get away?

191
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,030
Let's go back to the village
and get another girl.

192
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,930
We will find her before
we humiliate ourselves!

193
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,350
Get back to searching at once!

194
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,000
No! Wait!

195
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,410
There's a monster out there!

196
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,240
A monster?

197
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,270
What are you?

198
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,950
You looked like an empty husk at first.

199
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:37,760
Then you went all squiggly,
and you came back to life.

200
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:43,230
One time, Sissy stepped on a bug and it
came back to life, and it scared me.

201
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:48,810
Isn't that called... uh... in... imm...

202
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,810
Immortal, right?

203
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,770
Sissy taught me.

204
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,260
By the way, where did you come from?

205
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,780
Not Ninannah, right? And you don't
look like you're from Yanome...

206
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,050
What's your name?

207
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,290
Mine's March!

208
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,000
Hey! Say something!

209
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,750
Don't you know how to talk?!

210
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,090
That fruit looks sweet.

211
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,850
Yeah, I'm getting hungry, too.

212
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,340
I'll get some for you!

213
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,990
Leave this to me! I'm a good climber!

214
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,100
Here!

215
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,660
You've gotta be kidding...

216
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,660
You poor thing.

217
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,310
Your parents must not have
taught you manners.

218
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,370
Here.

219
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,410
You eat with your hands, like this.

220
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,400
You're so awful!

221
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,150
For crying out loud...

222
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,150
You're mean! That was mine!

223
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,900
Sheesh...

224
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,640
No! These are mine!

225
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,440
Were you that hungry?

226
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,540
Listen. When someone you don't
know does something nice for you,

227
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,230
you have to say "thank you," okay?

228
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,760
Can you say that? Say "thank you."

229
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,730
"Thank you."

230
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,300
Thank you.

231
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:52,370
Thank you.

232
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,410
Hey!

233
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,410
Don't just walk away!

234
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,580
You're going to sleep?

235
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,520
Hey.

236
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,650
Mommy! Daddy!

237
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,420
I'm home!

238
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,320
March!

239
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,490
Huh?

240
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,360
Where's Lisa?

241
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,880
It's your fault, March.

242
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,840
Sissy...

243
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:24,130
They were sacrificed because you ran away.

244
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:09,730
Wh-What's the matter?
Why are you following me?

245
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,400
Sheesh...

246
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,730
I'm not your mommy, you know!

247
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:51,010
Preview

248
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:37,520
A boy who knows nothing, and March,
who acts like a loving mother to her son.

249
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:41,740
The two interact, little by little.

250
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,150
Parona struggles to save March.

251
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:49,470
Hayase pursues March relentlessly.

252
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:53,820
And a giant shadow emerges.

253
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:55,010
A Small Evolution
