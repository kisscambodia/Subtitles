1
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:13,320
I cast the orb unto the Earth.

2
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,990
Its function is to gather information.

3
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,820
Light.

4
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,500
Scents.

5
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:32,550
Sounds.

6
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:34,740
Happiness.

7
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,090
Sadness.

8
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,990
All this information and the
stimulation it brings with it

9
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,480
allows the orb to change into many forms.

10
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,690
It took on the appearance of the boy

11
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,840
and set off.

12
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,540
A girl of the Ninannah region, March.

13
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,720
She was chosen to be sacrificed to Oniguma...

14
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,190
But she fled on her way to the ritual.

15
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,030
And from March's actions,

16
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,000
it receives further stimulation.

17
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:02,220
"Thank you."

18
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,730
Thank you.

19
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,840
Thank you.

20
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,820
The journey of the orb,

21
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,070
traveling through this stimulation-rich world,

22
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,420
had only just begun.

23
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,340
Sheesh...

24
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,740
I'm not your mommy, you know!

25
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,470
Put your hands out.

26
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,760
Like this.

27
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,140
Here you go.

28
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,710
You're such a child.

29
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,290
And you don't even have ink on your face.

30
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,060
By the way, where did you come from?

31
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,640
Not Ninannah, right? And you don't
look like you're from Yanome...

32
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,710
Are you one of the legendary Doki people?

33
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,700
Oh, right.

34
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,450
I need to give you a name.

35
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,860
Let's see...

36
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,650
You're immortal, so Fujimi-chan.

37
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,690
Fuji-chan?

38
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,500
Oh! How about Fushi-chan?

39
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,330
Lame?

40
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,670
How about Fu-chan, then?

41
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,630
Fu-chan!

42
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,920
A Small Evolution

43
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,670
I'm so bored, I'm about to fall asleep.

44
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,450
They sure are taking their time.

45
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,490
What is that?

46
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,800
Run!

47
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,420
March!

48
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,030
There you are, March-san.

49
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:06,900
March...

50
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,890
I'm coming to save you.

51
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,860
Fu-chan!

52
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,240
Mommy's going now.

53
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,810
Just kidding.

54
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,990
Thank you!

55
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,240
Most animals cannot choose
their own environments.

56
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:39,040
Therefore, in order to adapt,

57
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,260
they need to change themselves.

58
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,400
For humans, especially,
such changes are preceded

59
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,670
by emotion.

60
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,350
March...

61
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,750
Where are you?

62
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,980
Where have you gone?

63
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,650
Hey...

64
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:39,940
Have you seen a little girl?

65
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,070
She has long hair...

66
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,240
Where are you going?

67
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,880
Where...

68
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,420
Those flags...

69
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,920
Now, eat this.

70
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,020
What is this? It tastes weird.

71
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,840
All girls who are to be offered must eat that.

72
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,990
Be sure to eat the whole thing.

73
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,110
By the way, March-san...

74
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:44,120
Who was that man who was with you earlier?

75
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,680
He didn't seem to be of
either Yanome or Ninannah.

76
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,900
He said he's a traveler.

77
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,370
He just happened to be there.

78
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,430
You liar!

79
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,480
Hayase!

80
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,940
He's the monster we saw yesterday!

81
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,300
He's not of this world!

82
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,690
He's a monster!

83
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:09,590
Huh?

84
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,880
E-Everyone!

85
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,660
Everyone!

86
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,350
Hey, weren't you on guard duty?

87
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,710
Why are you here?

88
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,330
Don't come any farther!

89
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,890
We were attacked! We lost one man!

90
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,280
Attacked?

91
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:22,980
Yeah!

92
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,110
It was a bear!

93
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,310
A bear?

94
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,710
The spines on its body...

95
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,510
It must have been Oniguma-sama!

96
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,680
Come on, Oniguma-sama is just a legend.

97
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,970
Are you sure it wasn't an
ordinary bear you saw?

98
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,250
No!

99
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,500
That was no ordinary bear!

100
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,760
All right.

101
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,050
Let's go around it and head
straight to the altar.

102
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,980
Are you serious?!

103
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,570
Between that monster and that bear...

104
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,760
Something's not right!

105
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,640
Let's go back to the village!

106
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,480
We will not.

107
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,490
Let's go.

108
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:19,400
I won't become a grown-up

109
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:33,660
I chose so, by myself

110
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:44,050
"That's a commendable choice, March-san"

111
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:44,020
This is for the best

112
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,710
She's sound asleep.

113
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,290
It's done.

114
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,720
Let's go.

115
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,730
This mission was exhausting.

116
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,160
We need to report the death to Yanome.

117
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,920
What is that sound?

118
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,760
That's...

119
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:49,990
It can't be!

120
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,230
Oniguma-sama!

121
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,270
It really exists...

122
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:01,840
March!

123
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,630
Hey, you!

124
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,230
Wait.

125
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,610
Let her be.

126
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,880
It can have twice the food.

127
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,000
It's so tight...

128
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:32,550
Wake up!

129
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,130
March!

130
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,660
There's no reason...

131
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,470
to follow these old customs!

132
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:52,170
If you want to become a grown-up,
that's your decision to make!

133
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,740
Let's go.

134
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,930
Close the gate.

135
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,730
It ate him.

136
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,910
No.

137
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,270
Wait...

138
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,390
He's still trying to do something.

139
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,280
What is happening?

140
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,020
Is it an act of the gods?

141
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:55,950
March!

142
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,640
March!

143
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,900
March!

144
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:06,900
March!

145
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,950
Sissy...

146
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,830
What happened?

147
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,020
Listen to me.

148
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,800
We will report that

149
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,180
the ritual was a success and March-san died.

150
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,380
What?

151
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,160
You understand what this means.

152
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:50,450
The two of you will die, or you
will come to our land alive.

153
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,850
Choose.

154
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,580
March.

155
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,530
Let's go.

156
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,600
Let's live!

157
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,500
We're taking them back to Yanome.

158
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:06,810
All of them.

159
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,290
All of them?

160
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:14,640
The kids, the bear, and...

161
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,670
that wolf.

162
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,890
What's wrong, puppy?

163
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,610
Are you hungry?

164
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:31,940
No, March!

165
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,430
That thing's dangerous!

166
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,310
He's eating it.

167
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,890
Thank you.

168
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:51,010
Preview

169
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:37,250
Parona and March escape death,
captured by Hayase.

170
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:43,120
In the vibrant city of Yanome,
they experience the joys of living.

171
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:49,170
But Hayase's plots to unravel immortality

172
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,070
threaten to ensnare the two once again.

173
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:55,010
A Large Vessel
