1
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,430
In the beginning, it was an orb.

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,170
Not just any orb.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:19,680
It was an orb that captured the reflections
of many things and changed in response.

4
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:25,900
I decided to cast the orb unto
the Earth and observe it.

5
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:38,320
It spent some time in the form of a rock.

6
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:49,070
As its surroundings grew warmer,
it took the form of moss.

7
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,020
In time, snow began to fall upon the land.

8
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,030
A Reshy wolf appeared from the south...

9
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,630
and then it perished.

10
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,880
It then took on the form of the wolf.

11
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,610
And it became conscious.

12
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,700
It didn't know how to walk, but it was
soon able to replicate the behavior.

13
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,090
It moved clumsily.

14
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,310
It seemed to have replicated
the wolf's injury.

15
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,260
Its first discomfort.

16
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,390
Its first pain.

17
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,220
But it recovered within twenty seconds.

18
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,110
Not a problem.

19
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,980
It began to walk,

20
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:19,580
experiencing the cold of the wind and
the scent of the snow for the first time

21
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,130
as it wandered aimlessly.

22
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,400
Joaan!

23
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,490
You're finally back!

24
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,070
Thank goodness you're safe!

25
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,150
You were gone for two whole
months! I was so worried!

26
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,320
But I knew you'd never forget about me.

27
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,290
You seem quieter than usual.

28
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,780
I get it. You must be tired.

29
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,670
Here, there were many
new and unfamiliar things.

30
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,430
The pleasure it felt as its
body temperature rose,

31
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,230
an unidentifiable scent...

32
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,690
This was an alluring space.

33
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:43,190
If it could speak, it would have said
it wanted to stay here forever.

34
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,560
I keep telling you not to go near the fire.

35
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,940
Here's your food.

36
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,720
Here.

37
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,270
Huh?

38
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,240
I get it.

39
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,690
You don't like it because
it's not horndeer milk.

40
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,450
Well, I can't help that.

41
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,520
The last one died a year ago.

42
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,030
The fire's going out.

43
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,420
We should go to sleep before it does.

44
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:34,230
This boy, whose name it didn't even
know, was the first person it met.

45
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,300
The Last One

46
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,090
It's never going to dry if it keeps snowing.

47
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,390
The wood from Auntie's place is no good.

48
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,610
What's that? I have no right to complain
when I'm taking people's stuff?

49
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,940
Sorry. I know.

50
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,840
Everyone's going to be
angry when they get back.

51
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,860
What choice do I have?

52
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,340
I have to do this, or I'll die.

53
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,970
Of course I believe it!

54
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,950
It's been five years since they left.

55
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,370
Only five years!

56
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,410
I mean, they're way past there.

57
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,880
Way, way over there.

58
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,210
There's lots of food and people there.

59
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,310
They all went because they believed that.

60
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,690
And you know what?
They told me it's like paradise there.

61
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:52,470
There's plenty of fish, and lots of tasty stuff called... "fruit," I think?

62
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:55,410
There are tons of people who
are way smarter than we are,

63
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,210
and they all live happily
together every day.

64
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,790
I'm so jealous.

65
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,350
I wish I could've gone.

66
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,760
Do you remember?

67
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:09,130
I tried to go with the grown-ups,
but I couldn't, because you stopped me.

68
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,700
You bit my leg.

69
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,310
So they told me I had to stay behind and
watch over Grandma and the old folks.

70
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,600
Isn't that awful?

71
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,100
They said they'd be back with
gifts once they found paradise.

72
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,020
Remember when they said that?

73
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:30,490
In the end, the only ones who stayed behind
were the old folks that I couldn't save...

74
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,260
and us.

75
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,120
Joaan!

76
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,990
Please...

77
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,750
Welcome home!

78
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,000
Just kidding! It was actually a fish!

79
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,520
Woo-hoo! We haven't had one this big in ages!

80
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,330
Here's your share.

81
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,760
We need to save wood, so let's eat the rest raw.

82
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,350
What's wrong? That part's your favorite.

83
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,220
Have you forgotten how to eat?

84
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,370
Like this!

85
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,850
You put it in your mouth and chew.

86
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,400
Munch, munch.

87
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,400
See?

88
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,690
See?

89
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,770
Hey, you can eat.

90
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,230
Oh, this is Uncle and Auntie.

91
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,340
And here's my older cousin and his kids,

92
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,330
and the hairy guy from across the street...

93
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,320
And this is the lady next door.
Doesn't it look just like her?

94
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,700
I just wanted to make it clear
that there were people here...

95
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,080
and make sure I don't forget.

96
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,730
Joaan, I'm thinking of
leaving this place, too.

97
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:00,730
I want to meet all sorts of people
and feel all sorts of things.

98
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,470
I'm sure some of it will be bad,

99
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,030
but I still want to learn about the world.

100
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:11,150
Of course, you're coming with me.

101
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,010
You can't see the sea anymore.

102
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,940
I've never come this far before.

103
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,630
According to my uncle, it's due south.

104
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,860
You turn your back to my house
and just walk straight.

105
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,520
You can't see it now,

106
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,690
but eventually, you'll see a huge
mountain standing there like a wall.

107
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,500
Past that is paradise.

108
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:00,030
All right, let's keep going until it gets dark.

109
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,240
What's that?

110
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,730
It's a message!

111
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:29,410
For people like me who
are heading to paradise!

112
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,880
It's saying to go this way!

113
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,740
Yes! This is great!

114
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,750
See, Joaan?

115
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,230
Aren't you glad we left?

116
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,870
Yeah, I'm happy, too!

117
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,570
Do you know what vegetables are, Joaan?

118
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:49,650
Apparently, I ate some a long time ago,
but I don't remember it at all.

119
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,240
And then there're the round,
sweet things called "fruit."

120
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:58,280
I asked my uncle what "sweet" is like,
but I still didn't really get it.

121
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,210
I can't wait to try it.

122
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,210
I'm so excited.

123
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,670
It'll be ultimate freedom!

124
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,130
It's really starting to snow.

125
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,000
Oh? Was that a whimper I just heard?

126
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,590
Our journey's just getting started.

127
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,000
Look! It's a tree!

128
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,220
This is amazing! It means we're
getting close to the mountains!

129
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,230
Let's take some for firewood.

130
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,410
There.

131
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,940
Time to head out again.

132
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,960
Now I've done it...

133
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,230
My face is freezing.

134
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,850
I'm soaked through.

135
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,390
This is great, though! There's a river here!

136
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,730
Let's catch some fish!

137
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,730
You just laughed at me, didn't you?

138
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,790
That'll do it.

139
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,630
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

140
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,000
It's just a scratch.

141
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,460
Come on, stop joking around.

142
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,800
I'm not going back.

143
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,310
That would be way too embarrassing.

144
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,670
It's not like we're out of food.

145
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,490
We're walking tomorrow, too.

146
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,370
And the day after, and the day after that.

147
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,350
Even if you say you don't want to.

148
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,010
You gotta use your strength
while you still have it.

149
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,250
That's not right, Joaan.

150
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,270
I think it would be even
more foolish to give up

151
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,820
just because we don't know
if the others are still alive.

152
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:07,720
Even if we went back now,
we'd just rot away with that house.

153
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,570
I don't want that.

154
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,880
I want to go where the others are.

155
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,030
That's the only thing
that's left for me to do.

156
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:20,540
And I'm sure the reason they haven't come back
is because where they are now is so great.

157
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,960
Great food, great people...

158
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,220
They're enjoying themselves so much,
and they're having too much fun.

159
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,170
That's why...

160
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,800
This is amazing, Joaan!

161
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,320
This is evidence that
there were people here!

162
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,580
Look at this!

163
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,010
They really came through here!

164
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,570
Which means, uh...

165
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,980
We're on the right track!

166
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,130
We can make it to the mountains!

167
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,510
We can definitely make it!

168
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,510
We can...

169
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:57,420
Can we... make it?

170
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,590
Wh-What do you think, Joaan?

171
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,400
Do you think I can make it?

172
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,700
Tell me.

173
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,040
Say something to me like you always do.

174
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:18,990
I guess you can't answer me, huh?

175
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,330
O-Of course not...

176
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,660
I was just talking to
myself this whole time!

177
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,610
Damn it...

178
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,950
Damn it!

179
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,320
Yeah...

180
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,690
I'm sorry, Joaan.

181
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,750
You came with me all this way.

182
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,190
I shouldn't have said that.

183
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,140
I'm sorry.

184
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,540
I'm sorry...

185
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,070
Let's go back.

186
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,440
Let's go back, okay, Joaan?

187
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,830
I decided that.

188
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,050
Not you.

189
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,130
I want to go home.

190
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,380
I want to go home.

191
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,150
Let's go.

192
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,370
Why are you looking at me like that?

193
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,840
Do you feel sick?

194
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,460
Or are you trying to make me smile?

195
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,020
I know, I know.

196
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,730
You're hungry, aren't you?

197
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,620
I'll make you something to eat.

198
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,290
Good, good.

199
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,610
It's healing.

200
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,090
Does it smell yummy or something?

201
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:49,090
Once this wound heals,
we're going to try again, Joaan.

202
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,610
That's... strange...

203
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,730
My chair...

204
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:50,400
Y'know... I... I don't want to be lying down...

205
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,820
when everyone gets back. I'd look pathetic.

206
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,490
This is my spot.

207
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:03,760
This is where... I look best.

208
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,710
Joaan...

209
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:13,530
I want you to do something for me.

210
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,320
Remember me...

211
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,320
forever.

212
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:51,670
All right, time to set
out for paradise again!

213
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,920
Huh? Joaan!

214
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,000
Everyone!

215
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:02,090
Wow... You were all waiting for me!

216
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:04,510
That's great! I'm not alone anymore!

217
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,070
I can keep going now!

218
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,030
Look, everyone! There are people!

219
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,320
Hello, everyone.

220
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,550
Nice to meet you.

221
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:14,770
Tell me about this place.

222
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,970
Have you heard of fruit?

223
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,070
Hello!

224
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,290
Nice to meet you!

225
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,790
My name is...

226
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:32,490
It took on the form of a human.

227
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,120
Conditions must be met to obtain a new form.

228
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,680
It needs stimulation.

229
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:44,070
It set forth in search of more stimulation.

230
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:50,410
It will meet all kinds of people
and feel all kinds of things...

231
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,000
Just as the boy had wished to do.

232
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:51,010
Preview

233
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:34,190
It arrived in a great forest.

234
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,260
The South.

235
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:40,120
There, a young girl, March, lives freely.

236
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,000
But by the law of the land,
she is chosen to be a sacrifice.

237
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:49,000
Her dream of becoming a grown-up
is about to come to an end.

238
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:53,440
Two beings striving to
survive meet one another.

239
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:55,010
A Rambunctious Girl
