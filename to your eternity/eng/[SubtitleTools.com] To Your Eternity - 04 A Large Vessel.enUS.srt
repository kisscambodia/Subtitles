1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:08,150
The orb that I cast upon the
world transformed into a boy.

2
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:14,470
March, a girl from Ninannah, named him Fushi.

3
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:22,330
Through the stimulation of
his battle against Oniguma,

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,390
Fushi acquired new information.

5
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,550
Thank you.

6
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,610
Listen, no one can see us playing this game.

7
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,350
You have to hide here
until I come back. Okay?

8
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,790
Onee-chan?

9
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,450
Here's some food.

10
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,190
You can eat some berries if you run out.

11
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,700
Onee-chan!

12
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:27,330
I'll make you a new stuffed
doll when you win the game.

13
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:28,760
Parona!

14
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,140
Where have you been all week?

15
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,030
Where's Onee-chan?

16
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,390
She's not here anymore.

17
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,090
She was chosen to be the
sacrifice to Oniguma-sama.

18
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,010
Onee-chan!

19
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,470
What a coward, running away from the ritual!

20
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,880
Onee-chan!

21
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,690
And you call yourself a woman of Ninannah?

22
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,190
Onee-chan!

23
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,560
You aren't of this village anymore!

24
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,170
Get out of here!

25
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,220
I was dreaming.

26
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,000
I wonder what kind of
face she made back then.

27
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,510
A Large Vessel

28
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,130
Thank you.

29
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,970
Thank you.

30
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,140
Funny puppy!

31
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,150
Here you go.

32
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,900
Thank you.

33
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,100
How much further are we going?

34
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,700
It'll take another twenty
days to get to Yanome.

35
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,960
You're a Yanome shaman, aren't you?

36
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,810
Why are you with us in this wagon?

37
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,090
Oh, yeah!

38
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,480
She's the one who did horrible things to me!

39
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,720
Why did you choose me?!

40
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,350
Because you were the prettiest.

41
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,710
R-Really?

42
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:13,110
Look. I'm a criminal.

43
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:21,570
They're so desperate to satisfy their greed that
they get a fake shaman to help them murder.

44
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,380
Greed?

45
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,820
Yanome wants Ninannah's lush lands.

46
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:31,200
That's why they became involved
with the sacrifice tradition.

47
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:36,910
They help with the ritual and show
their gratitude by providing supplies.

48
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:43,880
"People of Ninannah, thank you for
protecting all of humanity from Oniguma."

49
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:50,260
All that remains is psychological
manipulation and occupation.

50
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,180
I had no idea.

51
00:04:53,050 --> 00:05:00,430
I'm disgusted that horrible ritual has been
carried on under the pretense of tradition.

52
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,920
Oh, my.

53
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,380
I thought the people of Ninannah
were faithful to their beliefs,

54
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,690
even if it meant the deaths of their own.

55
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,640
Only the old grown-ups.

56
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,820
They don't care about what
those suffering endure.

57
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,450
We need to end this terrible
custom immediately.

58
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,250
That won't happen.

59
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,470
Ninannah's elders are old-fashioned.

60
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,860
They wouldn't believe you if you
told them that their god is dead.

61
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,960
God?

62
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,220
What can we do?

63
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,610
No! No!

64
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,610
What's wrong?!

65
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,160
It's so stinky!

66
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,820
It's coming this way!

67
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,830
Puppy!

68
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,320
Let's wash ourselves off.

69
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,280
It's cold, but don't be afraid.

70
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,660
Remember...

71
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,700
me...

72
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,660
forever.

73
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,600
My!

74
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,860
So it was you!

75
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,620
I missed you!

76
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,900
You know him?

77
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,650
Yeah.

78
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,200
His name's Fushi-chan.

79
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,710
We need to go before it gets dark.

80
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,830
No, Fushi-chan!

81
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,660
Come with me.

82
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,710
Good boy.

83
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,930
I'll have to teach you how
to use the potty later, too.

84
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,570
Has he warmed up to March?

85
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,210
Fu-chan's still a little boy.

86
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:06,030
So I decided I'm going to be his mommy.

87
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,230
"Fushi," as in "immortal," huh?

88
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,060
It's unfortunate for him
that he can't die, though.

89
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,900
I think it matters to humans
what we spend our lives doing.

90
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,700
What purpose are you supposed to
find in life if you live forever?

91
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,880
Purpose?

92
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,450
Sorry.

93
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,620
It's wrong of me to seek purpose
in another's life and death.

94
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:39,300
I don't get it, but I'm
really happy right now.

95
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,580
Please wear these.

96
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,410
Are these Yanome clothes?

97
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,950
There's a set for Fu-chan, too.

98
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,960
I'll get you changed.

99
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,900
Arms up!

100
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,430
What happens to us now?

101
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,590
As of today,

102
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,670
you are March and Parona
of the nation of Yanome.

103
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,130
Wow, look! Look!

104
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,900
All that yummy-looking food!

105
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,970
So many pretty things!

106
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,910
Help yourselves to whatever
you'd like to have.

107
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,270
I'll pay for it.

108
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,730
Really?

109
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,290
It smells so good.

110
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:11,380
Is there anything you'd like
to say to those you love?

111
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,640
Letters! Letters!

112
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,690
Hey! Hey! Over there!

113
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,540
We deliver your messages!

114
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,320
Welcome.

115
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,640
Write what you want to say or convey here.

116
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,340
Write?

117
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,860
Oh, I see.

118
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,100
Not to worry.

119
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,830
I'll write for you. Go ahead and tell me.

120
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,600
Let's see...

121
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,060
Mommy, Daddy, how are you?

122
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,060
I'm in Yanome right now.

123
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,030
Don't worry about me.

124
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,510
The end.

125
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,070
Okay.

126
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,810
And where shall I deliver it to?

127
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,330
To Mommy and Daddy.

128
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,040
They're in Ninannah.

129
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,690
Ninannah?!

130
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,850
The sacred land of Oniguma-sama?!

131
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,320
That's right.

132
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,790
Ninannah has no reading or writing.

133
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:05,590
Neither your father nor your mother will
understand what's written in the letter.

134
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,500
I know a different kind of writing, though.

135
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,780
Oh? What does it look like?

136
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,350
Like this!

137
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,060
What does that say?

138
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,940
It says, "March is doing great!"

139
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,860
March...

140
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,880
Send this, please.

141
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,730
Sure.

142
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,680
Where in Ninannah?

143
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,460
I said, to Mommy and Daddy!

144
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,340
Which district? Which street?

145
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,610
Whose jurisdiction?

146
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,430
Sissy, do you know?

147
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,130
No.

148
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,200
Ninannah is large.

149
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,110
The nearest district alone has 40 settlements.

150
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,970
What is that drawing?

151
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,420
March-san, let's have dinner.

152
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,380
I'll hold on to this letter for you.

153
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,530
Let's come back when we find out
where Mommy and Daddy live.

154
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,280
Fine.

155
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,570
What is this?

156
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:17,810
It's so good!

157
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,440
Look at how he eats.

158
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,810
Thank you.

159
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,580
Thank you.

160
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,050
Now, Fushi-chan, mind your manners.

161
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,060
Remember what I told you?

162
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,280
You have to eat with your hands, like this.

163
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,430
Got it?

164
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,510
March-san, why don't you mind your manners
and use the chopsticks on your head, too?

165
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,690
Chopsticks?

166
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,440
These are head scratchers.

167
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,060
You use them when your head's itchy.

168
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:59,260
It seems that Yanome's culture hasn't
been correctly conveyed to Ninannah.

169
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,980
I apologize.

170
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,110
Please continue as you were.

171
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:09,890
Eat however you like, Fushi-chan.

172
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,340
Are you okay, Fushi-chan?

173
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:29,300
It seems he's learned the
Yanome way of eating.

174
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,490
Well, March-san?

175
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,170
Yanome is a fine nation, don't you think?

176
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,890
Don't you think it's a plenty comfortable
place to spend the rest of your life?

177
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:43,880
I don't really...

178
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,630
March?

179
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,170
How unfortunate.

180
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,800
The western morning glory is indeed effective.

181
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:17,430
As I said before, for the first time
in the long history of the ritual,

182
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:21,290
we have finally seen Oniguma-sama
for the first time, and captured it.

183
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,810
There's also something I'd like to show you.

184
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,840
That boy.

185
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,500
As we were about to leave following the ritual,

186
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:35,160
we witnessed the boy defeat Oniguma-sama.

187
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,920
That boy? Defeated Oniguma?

188
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,110
Yes.

189
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,620
He is immortal.

190
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,850
Go.

191
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,240
If I kill you, I get to walk free!

192
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,350
His wound!

193
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:00,800
That's impossible!

194
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,180
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!

195
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,990
It hurts! It hurts!

196
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,140
It hurts.

197
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,560
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!

198
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,720
It hurts.

199
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,350
It hurts.

200
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,660
It hurts! It hurts!

201
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,340
It hurts.

202
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,660
Forgive me, boy!

203
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,890
I wanna get out, find a lover,
eat good food, and have some fun!

204
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:30,980
It hurts.

205
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,970
So die, please!

206
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,870
It hurts.

207
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,820
It hurts.

208
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,270
It hurts.

209
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:40,330
Is he a god or a monster?

210
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,150
I don't know.

211
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,330
It hurts.

212
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,970
I believe, though...

213
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,990
It hurts.

214
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,550
that his power is unlimited.

215
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:49,980
He is essential to Yanome's future.

216
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,650
Move it, old hag!

217
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,870
I'll lop your head off!

218
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,340
It hurts.

219
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,960
Fu-chan!

220
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,090
It hurts.

221
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:22,360
March-san, please make sure he behaves.

222
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,550
It hurts.

223
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,780
Be strong.

224
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,940
It hurts.

225
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,260
It hurts.

226
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:35,180
They won't get away with this.

227
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,200
There, there.

228
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,990
There, there.

229
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,380
There, there.

230
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,710
There! All better!

231
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,120
You did good, Fu-chan.

232
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,450
March, is Fushi with you?

233
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,020
Sissy?

234
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,430
Where are you?

235
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,110
Over here, March.

236
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,030
Sissy!

237
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,890
What's in your room?

238
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,960
Straw, a pot... and this. That's it.

239
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,650
Okay.

240
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,410
Tie that to this.

241
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,670
Where are we?

242
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,780
What's going to happen to us?

243
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,990
Don't worry, March.

244
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,310
I know.

245
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,380
Could you gather some of Fushi's fur?

246
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,420
Fu-chan's?

247
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,630
To the right.

248
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,350
Keep going.

249
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,300
Mister!

250
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,680
When do we get to leave?

251
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,640
You're staying here forever.

252
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,560
It hurts. It hurts.

253
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,500
It hurts. It hurts. It hurts.

254
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,340
What's wrong?

255
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,620
Your wound's all better, isn't it?

256
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:57,630
It hurts.

257
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,010
It hurts. It hurts.

258
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,060
Fu-chan?

259
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,550
It hurts.

260
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:12,990
It hurts.

261
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,310
It hurts.

262
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,930
It hurts. It hurts.

263
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:22,880
It hurts.

264
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,590
What is this?

265
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,300
It hurts.

266
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,490
An arrow?

267
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,000
These are all arrows?

268
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,710
Poor thing.

269
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,880
We have to make him better.

270
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,420
How is our progress?

271
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,330
No one seems to want to
tend to Oniguma-sama.

272
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,830
How could it be so difficult
to take care of a bear?

273
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,850
Let's have her do it.

274
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,680
Are you sure? It's dangerous.

275
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,850
It's fine.

276
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,200
She's just a little girl.
It won't matter if she dies.

277
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:19,090
I can't believe she's making
you take care of that bear.

278
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,320
It's too dangerous to do it yourself.

279
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,950
I have Fushi-chan and Kanitaro with me.

280
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,340
I'll be all right.

281
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:29,380
You're doing cleaning, right, Sissy?

282
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,500
Hang in there.

283
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,530
Yeah.

284
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:32,880
But...

285
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,050
Don't worry.

286
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,270
First, I'm going to pretend to be
Yanome with that old lady's help.

287
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,810
Help me!

288
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,720
I'm dying!

289
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,120
And then we'll help you.

290
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,300
We did it!

291
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:54,940
We'll kill Oniguma, and we'll bring
home its hide and eyes as proof.

292
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,870
Then I'm sure the people
of Ninannah will agree

293
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,170
that we don't need that ritual anymore!

294
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,870
I think we can do it.

295
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,920
No, we have to.

296
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,750
No matter what.

297
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,730
Right, Onee-chan?

298
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:36,690
You're just like me, huh?

299
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:43,900
People said I was special and
amazing when I left Ninannah.

300
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,330
I'm just a little girl, though.

301
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:47,770
It hurts.

302
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,340
It hurts.

303
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:53,180
And you're just a bear that likes human meat.

304
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,090
People made a fuss about you,
and they shot you with arrows...

305
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,490
It hurts.

306
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,110
It hurts.

307
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:00,120
And you really ended up
looking like Oniguma-sama.

308
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:58,810
It hurts.

309
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,750
It hurts.

310
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,890
You'll be able to go home
once your wounds heal.

311
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,670
You can go home.

312
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,490
I'm sorry I made you feel uneasy.

313
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,930
I'm sorry.

314
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,120
There, there.

315
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,200
There, there.

316
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,650
There, there.

317
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,970
It hurts.

318
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,260
It hurts.

319
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,780
Thank you.

320
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,880
The vessel opened.

321
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,590
Oniguma is dead.

322
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,960
They'll come retrieve the body by tomorrow.

323
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,890
We need to escape with the proof first.

324
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,030
We'll be out of here in no time, March.

325
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:21,030
You don't need to become a
grown-up in this damn place.

326
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,430
Over there!

327
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,910
Onee-chan!

328
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,140
It hurts.

329
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:55,810
Looks like I'm in a storage room.

330
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,200
Look who it is.

331
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,290
It's you.

332
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:06,470
I won't tell anyone that
you tried to run away.

333
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,490
So just do as I say.

334
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,630
How dare you?!

335
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,750
I won't tell anyone.

336
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,890
So do as I say.

337
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,230
Shift's up.

338
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,500
You!

339
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,660
What do you want?

340
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,550
I'm taking you with me.

341
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:50,000
Onee-chan, I bet you were
smiling, too, weren't you?

342
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:54,850
So I'm going to make good use
of the life you gave me.

343
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,520
We're escaping.

344
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,380
Sissy!

345
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:34,480
Preview

346
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:36,960
Parona and the others leave the prison,
carrying out their plan to return to Ninannah.

347
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:44,120
But a party of Yanome led by Hayase
mercilessly blocks their way.

348
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:53,600
With their grand escape, yet another
change comes upon Fushi's body.

349
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:55,010
