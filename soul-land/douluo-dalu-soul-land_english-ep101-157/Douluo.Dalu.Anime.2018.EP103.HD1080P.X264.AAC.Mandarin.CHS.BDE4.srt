How can this happen?

24

Last time, Captain endured longer time
while competing with Tang San.

25

But he’s defeated very quickly this time.

26

It also decides the ownership
of the three soul bones.

30

The more Hao Tian Hammer’s
ability is exposed,

31
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,260
the more determined
Martial Soul Hall wants to kill him.

32
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,100
This puts Little San into a riskier position.

34
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,060

The Martial Soul Fusion Skill
of Xie Yue and Hu Liena

39
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,240
can resist our
Seven in One Fusion Skill temporarily.

40
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,490
Once our formation is destroyed by the other five,

41
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,570
we’ll be totally defeated.

42
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,590
Little San, what do you think?

43
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,170
To defeat the opponents,
I’ve come up with two ways.

44
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,180
One of it is to use the tool soul form again,

45
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,780
disregard of my spirit depletion.

46
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,180
But this might be targeted by the opponents.

47
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,700
The winning probability will be around 50%.

48
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,840
The tool soul form should
never be used again tomorrow,

49
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,080
as well as the Seven in One Fusion Skill.

50
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,620
All of you must keep in mind.

51
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,970
Once your skill has been known by the opponents,

52
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,760
you would have to change.

53
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,220
Once there’s a change,

54
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,940
the opponents’ pace will be disrupted.

55
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,100
And we can regain the initiative to fight.

56
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,100
Another way is

57
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,070
to break the opponents’ Martial Soul Fusion Skill,

58
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,420
making them lose the abilities to fight.

59
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,490
Then, we concentrate our powers

60
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,310
to clear the remaining five of the opponents.

61
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,540
Do you have the way to break the
Martial Soul Fusion Skill?

62
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,990
Martial Soul Fusion Skill is
incomparable to the common fusion skill.

63
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,540
Once it’s completed,

64
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,340
its power will be enormous.
And there’ll be no defects at all.

65
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,510
If both Soul Kings of the opponent fuse,

66
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,860
their strength to fight
can be increased to about Level 70.

67

between us is insurmountable.

164
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,230
Bibi Dong, they’re the ones that you chose.

165
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,750
The two War Soul Sects
from Storm Attack Branch,

166
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,620
Sun Chuan Tao,

167
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:38,770
and Li Kai.

168
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,580
[Li Kai, Martial Soul Hall School]
In the previous battle,

169
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,850
they didn’t reveal their real strength.

170
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:46,310
[Ma Hong Jun, Shrek Schook]
Will Shrek spur them on today?

171
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,310
[Xiao Wu, Shrek School]

172
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,940
Zhang Ping, War Soul Sect of Keen Attack Branch,

173
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,450
Xu Yu, Tool Soul Sect of Support Branch.

174
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,860
They didn’t reveal their strength.

175
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,470
How will they perform their strength today?

176
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,110
[Ning Rong Rong, Shrek School]

177
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,510
[Oscar, Shrek School]

178
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:15,790
<i>Xiao Gang, you’ve changed the formation as expected.</i>

179
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,730
There’ll be only one winner.

180
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,680
Who will be the champion in the end?

181
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,820
I announce that

182
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,340
the battle between Martial Soul
Hall School and Shrek School

183
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,190
begins now.

184
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,960
Second Soul Skill, Fox Charm.

185
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,140
Even the best charm skill needs its triggers of

186
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,700
hearing, sight, taste, smell,

187
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,860
tactile and sensation.

188
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,900
It’s released through one of the six.

189
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,980
Hu Liena from Martial Soul Hall team

190
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,300
relies on sight and hearing mainly.

191
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,770
So let’s do it in this way tomorrow.

192
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,840
Second Soul Skill, Charm.

193
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,430
<i>Unexpectedly, they counter the charm with charm.</i>

194
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,500
The one with stronger strength

195
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,860
would have an advantage over the other.

196
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,950
Xiao Wu!

197
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,220
Although Xiao Wu is injured,

198
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,020
she has undoubtedly broken
Hu Liena’s initiated skill.

199
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,060
<i>Xiao Wu.</i>

200
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,840
Fourth Soul Skill,

201
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,090
Bright Static Moon.

202
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:45,470
Martial Soul Fusion Skill, Genie Mesmerize.

203
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,210
The Martial Soul Fusion Skill of
Xie Yue and Hu Liena

204
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,890
can trap someone,

205
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,190
suppressing their multiple abilities.

206
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,560
Can Little San cope with it?

207
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,020
<i>Yu Tian Heng has already realized
that he couldn’t win in that battle.</i>

208
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,600
<i>But he still took the risk to battle</i>

209
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,230
<i>to force them using their trump in advance.</i>

210
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,590
As expected,

211
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:20,030
the outsiders couldn’t see
what’s happening in the red mist.

212
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,940
You can’t see it either?

213
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,940
This red mist is extremely weird.

214
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,810
I think

215
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:32,620
only those whose soul power
and spirit power at its peak

216
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,590
could figure out its mystery.

217
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,670
This is Genie Mesmerize.

218
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,980
I’ve never heard of

219
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,150
the form of Martial Soul Fusion Skill
will appear in a humanoid figure.

220
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:48,370
Did they fuse in such quick manner before this?

221
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,110
It’s the skill of the
soul master of Support Branch,

222
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,050
making them complete the fusion in an instant.

223
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,540
<i>Why didn’t Shrek Seven Devils interrupt
their Martial Soul Fusion Skill?</i>

224
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,900
<i>Is the current situation</i>

225
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,310
<i>also a part of Grandmaster’s plan?</i>

226
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:08,340
<i>If so, why did he do so?</i>

227
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,900
[Next Episode]
This thick red mist

228
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,380
mixes with power containing
a sense of ruthlessness and hallucination.

229
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,990
Don’t act rashly.

230
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,890
Before Seven in One
Martial Soul Fusion Skill is exerted,

231
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,290
they’re engulfed by the red mist.

232
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,610
The world’s first martial soul of Support Branch

233
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,440
is really threatening.

234
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,530
I’ll settle you first.

235
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,820
How could be this possible?

236
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,960
You’re right. Unless you can fly.

237
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,580
Then, we’ll fly.

238
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,480
Taste it, Tang San.

239
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,850
Once Xie Yue uses the skill,

240
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,440
it means you have no way to stay alive.
