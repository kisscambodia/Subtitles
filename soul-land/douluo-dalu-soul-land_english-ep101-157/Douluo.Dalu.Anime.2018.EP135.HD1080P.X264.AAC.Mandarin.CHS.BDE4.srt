You can’t keep going on like this

There is no trace of soul in her.

00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,760
No, Xiao Wu.

73
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,980
Is it because Xiao Wu gave her soul to me?

74
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:33,140
Brother, your soul power
has ascended to Level 65.

You must be the most powerful
Soul Emperor on the entire continent now.

In the future, you will become
a Soul Saint, a Great Soul Land Master,

Because she gave her everything to you.

Sister Wu died for you,

99

only you could revive her.

100
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:40,390
She sacrificed her life for you

as well as her soul.

102
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:47,050
She used the most ultimate way of sacrificing,

103
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:51,210
which is only harmful to herself.

104

Sister Wu’s original shape.

her decade millennium cultivation.

<i>He is worthy of your sacrifice.</i>

Big Brother and I had thought about it,

00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,250
there is only one way to save Sister Wu.

117
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,830
There are three preconditions for it to work.

118
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:51,230
Firstly, you have to find three kinds of herbs.

119
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,730
What are they?

120
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:57,030
First, the Sacred Soul Plant
which can arouse her soul.

121
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,990
It must be decade millennium years old or above.

122
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,710
Big Brother and I will find it for you.

123
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:06,470
The second one is a precious herb

124
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,810
which can help her to reborn
and remold her human form.

125
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:11,730
The Decade-Millennium
Ginseng King of the Ninth Grade.

126
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:18,890
<i>Ice Fire Mouth Spring boasts
countless premium herbs.</i>

127
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:21,750
<i>Yet I have never seen anything like that.</i>

128
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:26,270
The third one is a treasure that aids
the reunification of the soul and the body,

129
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:29,310
the neidan of an ancient soul beast.

130
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,870
You should find it yourself.

131
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,570
<i>Ancient soul beast?</i>

132
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,810
Got it.

133
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,530
This...

134
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,390
This is the neidan of
the Ten-Headed Burning Sun Serpent.

135
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,350
I got it when I was in Slaughter City.

136
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,370
Does this one work?

137
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,890
No problem.

138
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:58,250
Now, we only lack the Decade-Millennium
Ginseng King of Ninth Grade.

139
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,050
Big Brother and I saw one before.

140
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,050
Judging from its current cultivation,

141
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,410
it is most probably in the north.

142
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:09,490
You may search for it
in those famous forests in the north.

143
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:13,310
The Ginseng King is equivalent to
a Century Millennium Soul Beast.

144
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:16,510
I might not be able to fight against it
even if I have found it.

145
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,270
But,

146
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,090
I will find it.

147
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:25,490
No matter what, I will bring it back.

148
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:29,790
Remember, you must ensure
it’s still alive when it gets here.

149
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:34,450
It won’t work
if it loses its vigor.

150
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,610
However,

151
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,810
these are not what you should do now

152
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:54,950
since you have other preconditions to meet.

153
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:06,370
Xiao Wu, I know how to bring you back to life.

154
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,510
I will definitely make it.

155
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,350

<i>Human Faced Demon Spider.</i>
