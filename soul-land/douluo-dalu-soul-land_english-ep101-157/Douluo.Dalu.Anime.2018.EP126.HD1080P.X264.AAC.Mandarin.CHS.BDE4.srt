there’s something he has to face.

Well, I take back the words I’ve said.

45
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,830
A bet is a bet.

46
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,840
I concede your acknowledgment to our ancestors.

47
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,810
Stop staring at me.

48
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,070
A bet is a bet. Don’t you understand?

49
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,820
Our words do count.

50
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,050
Can I pay respect to my grandpa too?

51
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,460
Well...

52
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,000
No.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,240
Because of your father’s wrongdoing,

54
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,540
you’re not allowed to do so yet.

55
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,590
But you said that

56
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,080
you’d pay for what
your father had done wrong.

57
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,440
Serve the tribe.

58
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,710
Am I right?

59
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:50,010
Yes. What should I do to be allowed
to pay respect to my grandpa?

60
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,240
You have to do three things for the tribe.

61
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,110
Once you’ve done them all,

62
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,290
you can not only acknowledge the ancestors,

63
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,920
we’ll allow your father
to return to the tribe

64
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,880
and pay respect to the ancestors
together with you.

65
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,490
Pardon?

66
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:12,520
Leaving the tribe
is the eternal pain of Father’s.

67
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,030
If...

68
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,589
I’ll do it.

69
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:20,989
The deadline for completing
these three things is ten years.

70
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:26,350
First, breakthrough Level 80 of soul power.

71
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,530
I can do it.

72
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:33,970
Second, bring back the head of
a Grand Soul Land Masters from Martial Soul Hall.

73
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,930
Third, obtain a Decade Millennium Soul Ring

74
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,460
for your eighth soul ring period.

75
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,550
<i>Among the learned Grand Soul Land Masters,</i>

76
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:53,610
<i>only Father and Bibi Dong have obtained
a Decade Millennium Soul Ring.</i>

77
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,470
<i>And Dad inherits his from Mom.</i>

78
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,020
<i>It’s almost a mission impossible.</i>

79
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,140
Don’t you want to regain
the glory of the tribe?

80
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,370
I can promise you now,

81
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,850
if you achieve them all in ten years,

82
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,860
the soul bones returned by your father will be yours,

83
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,370
and you’ll be the next Tribe Chief too.

84
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,800
Only by taking this position,

85
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,240
you can truly lead the tribe
to regain its glory.

86
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,230
I’ll succeed.

87
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,510
<i>For Dad and for Hao Tian Tribe.</i>

88
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,850
<i>Hence, Dad’s entrustment
is finally completed.</i>

89
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,860
<i>It’s time to return to
Tian Dou City to visit my teacher and others.</i>

90

<i>I wonder how they are doing.</i>

91
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,400
- Ah! The lesson was hard.
- Agree. It’s really hard...

92
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:13,630
It has been five years.
I’m curious how they are doing?

93
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,780
You’ll find out when you see them.

94
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,220
Are Little San and Xiao Wu doing well?

95
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,280
It’s a pity that

96
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,480
they don’t know about
the promise of regathering in five years.

97
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,720
On this vast continent,
when can we meet again?

98
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,190
Heaven helps the worthy one.

99
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,020
Little San and Xiao Wu will be alright.

100
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,150
What are you doing here?

101
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,800
Is Dean Flander and Grandmaster in?

102
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,230
I’ve no idea whether they’re in,

103
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,530
but the school’s rules state that
outsiders are not allowed to enter.

104

to be admitted here,

Junior, you’re doing your job well,

107
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,790
But I don’t think
I need further training.

108
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,520
Please report to the Dean that

109
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,520
Dai Mu Bai and Zhu Zhu Qing are back.

110
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,810
If you’re Dai Mu Bai, then I can be Tang San.

Stop pretending.

112

It seems that we indeed
have impressed our school.

116

You should leave now if you know better.

Otherwise, I won’t let you off easily.

Boss Dai, you’re as violent as usual.

122
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,530
I was going to hug Zhu Qing.

123
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,610
Nice acting.

124
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,330
Much better than the last batches.

Twenty-Four Moonlight Bridges with you?

00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,290
I came back to the school once,

167
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,570
but I only managed to meet with our Master.

168
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,150
And our Master told me about it.

169
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:16,240
By the way, Rong Rong.
What did you say of Little Ao?

170
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,570
Little Ao.

171
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,080
I have no idea whether he’s coming.

172
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,530
Rong Rong.

173
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,450
Little Ao, please come back.

174
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,610
I don’t want you to be strong.
I want you back.

175
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,020
As long as you come back to me,

176
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,100
no matter how strict the tribe rules are,

177
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,360
I’ll never leave you.

178
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:05,650
It has been five years.
I’ve never heard from Little Ao again.

179
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:10,010
I can’t imagine what he has been through,
I’m afraid that he’s...

180
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,410
Although Little Ao looks playful,

181
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,210
he has high esteem.

182
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,400
For you,

183
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:27,440
he has always shown
endless courage and hard work.

184
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,990
Let’s hope that

185
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,650
the ten-year promise
is a good thing for him.

186
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:36,770
Say no more.
Rong Rong can’t take it anymore.

187
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,130
Rong Rong, stop crying.
You have to trust Little Ao.

188
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,340
Just wait for him.

189
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:49,180
What can I do besides waiting?

190
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,520
I truly regret it.

191
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,010
Why didn’t I fight firmly back at the time

192
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,620
and let Little Ao endure this alone.

193
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,690
He’s just a soul master from the Food Branch.

194
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,640
He can’t even obtain a soul ring by himself.

195
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,060
Great job, Captain.

196
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,490
It’s my responsibility.

197
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,680
Little Ao, this place is dangerous.

198
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,200
Hurry up. Give it the last strike
and absorb the soul ring.

199
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,680
Thank you, Brother Hulk.

200
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,250
A 20,000-year-old
Mirror Image Beast.

201
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,830
<i>Hopefully, you could give me
the skill I desire.</i>

202
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:13,290
Who dares to pretend
to be our little freaks

203
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,360
and want to fight?

204
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,090
Let me have a look.

205
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:19,710
Teacher Zhao.

206
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,060
So, it’s really you the little freaks.

207
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:35,290
The real Shrek Seven Devils...

208
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,580
Good. Very good. Let’s go inside.

209
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,570
It’s cold.

210
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,210
I can’t understand

211
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,170
why Oscar, a soul master from the Support Branch,

212
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,950
needs to obtain his soul ring
in Icebound Forest.

213
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:20,540
Couldn’t he just go to a random forest
to kill a Decade Millennium Soul Beast?

214
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:24,560
Hulk is Level 76
and he’s also the captain.

215
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,990
Both Oscar and he helped us
obtain the soul rings we desired.

216
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,860
We’ve no reason to complain about it now.

217
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,670
What about the captain?
His level is just slightly higher than mine.

218
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,990
He rubs me the wrong way.

219
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:40,810
<i>It has been five years.
I’ve known Little Ao for five years.</i>

220
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,150
<i>He never gives up his pursuit.</i>

221
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,040
<i>Who can expect that</i>

222
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,710
<i>a soul master from the Support Branch
would like to have...</i>

223
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,120
<i>What?</i>

224
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,770
This...

225
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,090
Soul Bone.

226
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,900
Soul bones are rarely spotted
on the entire continent.

227
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,300
I can’t believe to see it here.

228
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,830
Hulk has always preferred Oscar.

229
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:26,379
He’ll definitely give
the soul bone to Oscar.

230
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:33,020
Who can own the soul bone?

231
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,650
A dead man has no say.

Little San, when are you going to find Xiao Wu?

245
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,430
I’ll bring her back.

246
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,610
For the responsibility Dad left to me...

247
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,360
This is the promise he gave you.

248
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,690
You have to believe he can do it.

249
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,160
Let’s put this to an end.

250
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,580
Rong Rong.

251
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:12,210
Who dares to trespass?
They’d better watch out.
