Do you think you can win

Don’t overestimate yourselves.

But the situation in the red mist is unknown.

Can Tang San resist the attack of Genie Mesmerize?

Either Xie Yue and Hu Liena

53
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,400
took the initiative to lift
the Martial Soul Fusion Skill,

54

or they’ve been exhausted

55
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,050
and couldn’t sustain Genie Mesmerize anymore.

56
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,720
Which situation should be?

57
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,100
Chief Ning, what do you think?

58
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,510
The Martial Soul Fusion Skill of
Xie Yue and Hu Liena is indeed powerful.

59
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,250
But Tang San is talented.

60
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,240
It’s still uncertain whether
he could win surprisingly.

There are the marks
where Eight Spider Bones were cut off.

66
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,260
Little San shrieked just now

67
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,630
because his Eight Spider Bones were cut off alive.

68
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,360
Eight Spider Bone is like the bone in a human body.

69
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,530
Cutting off the bone alive

70
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,580
would be really painful.

71
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,960

At present, Tang San is collapsed
due to severe injuries.

Although Xie Yue and Hu Liena looked pale,

77
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,570
they’re still able to stand on stage.

It seems that Martial Soul Hall School
will obtain victory.

79

Honestly, I’m not as good as you in talent.

to turn the situation the other way around?

87
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,370
I’ve already known your real strength.

88
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,350
There are...

89
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,040
the shattered pieces of Eight Spider Bone.

90
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,860
What exactly is my real strength?

91
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,880
Do you know it?

92
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,700
This is your soul skill creation?

93

<i>Tang San’s soul bones are totally fractured now.</i>

94

<i>This means that I’ve completed
the mission of Her Holiness.</i>

<i>kill him in the red mist.</i>

97
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,030

<i>Batwing Rebound, the 10th ranked

<i>It makes the hidden weapons to fly in specific arcs.</i>

102
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,740
<i>It’s hard to predict its shot. And its angle is tricky.</i>

103
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,550
<i>It’s inescapable for ordinary people.</i>

104
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,450
<i>Batwing Rebound is capable of shooting</i>

105
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,570
<i>at most of 36 hidden weapons simultaneously.</i>

106
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,880
<i>With my present limit of soul power,</i>

107
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,560
<i>there are all shattered
pieces of Eight Spider Bone,</i>

108
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,290
<i>- which are 16 of it.</i>
- It’s bad.

109
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,970
<i>No one can escape from Batwing Rebound.</i>

110
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,870
<i>Xie Yue, you’re defeated at last.</i>

111
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,820
Tang San is really insidious.

112
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,690
He even used the shattered pieces that
Xie and I blocked to attack others.

113
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,870
<i>His estimation on angle and accuracy,</i>

114
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,580
<i>as well as the attack direction of Nana and me,</i>

115
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,300
<i>and the prediction of our soul power consumption</i>

116
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,540
<i>has reached such a terrifying level.</i>

117
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:44,500
But I wouldn’t give in. I won’t...

118
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,490
Uh.

119
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,400
The situation has changed dramatically.

120
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,630
The shattered pieces of Eight Spider Bone
that were launched by Tang San

121
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,450
can even knock down six soul masters.

122
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,760
Only Yan who has strong defense power
can resist the attack.

123
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,000
And Tang San was fainted over as well.

124
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,670
There’ll be one versus six for Yan now.
How long can he persist?

125
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,080
He knocked down many opponents at once.

126
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,300
What is that? Soul skill?

127

The opponent’s soul master of
Support Branch has fainted over.

128
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,240
I’ve known earlier that the
Eight Spider Bone is very powerful.

129
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,210
But I didn’t expect it to be such powerful.

130

Grand Venom Master, anything you want to remind me?

Only Tang San himself can dissolve it.

I can’t dissolve it either.

Shrek could have such a glorious day!

167
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,290
<i>He made it.</i>

168
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,620
Qibao Form.

169
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,700
Qibao Boosts! Third, Soul!

00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,310
This ambience...

172
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,950
Could it be...

173
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,130
How’s his condition?

174
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,040
Brother, please be all right.

175
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,870
Xiao Wu, don’t worry.
Brother San will be all right.

176
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,140
Yes. Have faith in him.

177
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,450
Um.

178
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,870
The wounds of Eight Spider Bone
on Little San’s back are recovering.

179
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:10,020
Little San’s body is totally a miracle!

180
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,260
Brother!

181
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,720
We’ve won.

182
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,990
Yes, we’ve won!

183
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,480
We’ve defeated the team of
Martial Soul Hall School.

184
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,320
We are the champion of Continental
Soul Master Elite Tournament.

185
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,050
My little freaks,

186
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,920
you’ve created an unprecedented miracle.

187
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,040
Tang San,

188
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:02,840
congratulations on obtaining the victory!

189
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,780
Please dissolve their poison immediately now.

Continental Soul Master Elite Tournament...

192
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,800
The final champion for this match is...

193
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,580
You’re the one that we missed out back then.

194
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,120
I never expect

195
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,620
you’ll come here yourself.

196
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,470
Do you want to know the reason?

197
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,700
Why don’t you ask your disciple then?

198
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,980
If you hinder us,

199
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:07,520
Qibao Amber Tribe will be
the enemy of Martial Soul Hall.

00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,360
Gui Mei, Yue Guan,

201
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:12,840
Seize that girl.
