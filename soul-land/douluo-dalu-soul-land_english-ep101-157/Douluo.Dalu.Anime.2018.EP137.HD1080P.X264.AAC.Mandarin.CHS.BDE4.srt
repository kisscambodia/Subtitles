Just a few days ago,
two out of Three Upper Tribes were gone.

Qibao Amber Tribe

are almost destroyed.

[Soul Land]
[Episode 137]

48
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,240
Emperor Xue Ye had four sons.

49
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,620
Xue Qing He is the eldest
and Xue Beng is the youngest.

50
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,520
The best out of the four wasn’t Xue Qing He,

51
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,280
but Second Prince.

52
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,080
But, Second Prince died when he was 12.

53
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,360
The next year, Third Prince died, too.

54
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,260
Was the death of these two princes
related to Xue Qing He?

55
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,020
No one could confirm without any evidence.

56
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,540
But, two days before Second Prince died,
Emperor Xue Ye just discussed about

57
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,460
crowning a prince with
a few high-ranked officials.

58
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,560
Most of the officials suggested Second Prince.

59
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,620
Was it done by someone behind Xue Qing He?

60
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,160
Actually, both of the princes died from poison.

61
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,260
But, all of the four princes stayed in the palace
at that time.

62
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,380
Their daily life was taken care of
by Emperor Xue Ye’s trusted followers.

63
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,980
Outsiders couldn’t get close to them

64
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,600
and wouldn’t have the chance to poison them.

65
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,620
Hence, the death of the two princes
became a cold case.

66
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,900
After that,

67
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,820
Emperor Xue Ye ordered Prince Xue Xing
to investigate this case.

68
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,220
Prince Xue Xing found out that

69
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,720
the two princes weren’t poisoned by drugs,

70
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,440
but the Poison of Martial Soul of a soul master.

71
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,700
But, this can’t prove that
it’s related to the Crown Prince, Xue Qing He.

72
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,740
If we don’t have any evidence,

73
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,660
we have to look for the most benefited one.

74
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,320
Second and Third Prince died.
Fourth Prince was too young.

75
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,380
Who would be the most benefited one?

76
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:50,160
If it was done by an outsider,
why did he let the eldest son live?

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,100
Not long ago,

78
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,320
Prince Xue Xing asked me
to check on Emperor Xue Ye.

79
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,140
I found out that Emperor Xue Ye was poisoned
by a mixed poison.

80
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,620
It was caused by a spice.

81
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,580
And Xue Qing He is the only one
who is using this spice in the palace.

82
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,620
<i>He’s definitely not a simple man…</i>

83
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,740
Then, why are you following Xue Beng?

84
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,080
Aren’t you afraid that

85
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,260
Xue Qing He will harm him if you do so?

86
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,500
Xue Qing He is meticulous,

87
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,800
but Xue Beng is not as simple as you think.

88
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,440
He avoids training purposely
to stop improving his soul power.

89
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,960
He pretends to be arrogant and bossy.

90
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,280
It’s the only way for him to live.

91
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,960
That’s why he…

92
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,780
Does Emperor Xue Ye know about

93
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,500
the mixed poison and Xue Qing He?

94
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,020
I only told him that he was poisoned
and asked him to maintain his conditions.

95
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,360
But, I gave him a medicine to relieve the poison.

96
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,180
No matter what,
this is a fight within the royal family.

97
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,500
Old Freak, you shouldn’t get involved in it.

98
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,900
I don’t care about the matters of the royal family.

99
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,520
But, the stability of Tian Dou Empire

100
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,760
will benefit us from fighting Martial Soul Hall.

101
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,240
You just came back. You don’t know
about the other two incidents yet, right?

102
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,360
What incidents?

103
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,120
Qibao Amber Tribe
and the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Tribe

104
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,580
were attacked by Martial Soul Hall.

105
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,540
Wha... What?

106
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:28,680
More than two thirds of the disciples
of the Qibao Amber Tribe died.

107
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,300
They moved to Tian Dou City.

108
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,300
But, the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Tribe
almost got extinct.

109
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,000
Only a few members away from the tribe survived.

110
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,760
You must accept this fact as soon as possible,

111
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,820
because I’m afraid that these are not all of
what Martial Soul Hall is planning to do…

112
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,020
Martial Soul Hall is so cruel.

113
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,800
Old Freak, please look into the matter
of the royal family.

114
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,880
I need to rush back to my school to meet my teacher.

115

What? Do you mean this rabbit is Xiao Wu?

121
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,520
It’s all my fault. I didn’t protect her well.

122

Martial Soul Hall! Bibi Dong! I’ll kill you!

123

Teacher Er Long, don’t be angry.

124
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,690

I’ll turn their world upside down!

Do you want to make Little San to die along with you?

164
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,760
Fatty, I’m thinking of setting up a clan.

165
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,980
I hope you can help me.

166
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,640
Setting up a clan? Brother San, are you joking?

167
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,520
Isn’t Martial Soul Hall re-selecting
the Seven Great Tribes one year later?

168
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,500
We shall bring some trouble to them.

169
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,240
Trouble? I like it.

170
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,280
Brother San, don’t worry. I’ll definitely help you.

171
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,380
Brother San, what kind of clan are you going to set up?

172
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,580
Shall I give you some ideas?

173
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,980
We have to get a cool name no matter what.

174
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,780
I have already decided on the name of the clan.

175
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,020
I’ll call it

176
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,540
Tang Clan.

177
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,000
Tang Clan? Why does it sound strange?

178
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,520
<i>Tang Clan. I can only miss you in this way now.</i>

179
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,920
Brother San, you’re setting up a clan by your own.

180
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,640
Won’t Hao Tian Tribe be pissed off?

181
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,520
Though I have been readmitted to Hao Tian Tribe,
it is shut down already.

182
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,000
There won’t be any conflicts
between Tang Clan and Hao Tian Tribe.

183
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,520
In the future, we can rely on each other.

184
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,660
Brother San, you’re really an ambitious man.

185
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,120
Anyway, I’ll follow you.

186
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,820
Now, there are only two members in Tang Clan.

187
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,260
You’ll be the Chief. I’ll be the Deputy Chief.
Is that okay?

188
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,900
If you want to be the Deputy Chief, do it then.

189
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,900
I have already thought about the detail plan
of setting up the clan.

190
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,360
I’ll commence with my plan
after discussing it with Master.

191
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,040
No problem.

192

Rong Rong, how’s Qibao Amber Tribe?

194
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,220
How can it be?

195
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,820
Dad brought the tribe
to stay in our school for a short while.

196
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,460
Then, they moved to the palace
after being invited by Emperor Xue Ye.

197
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,060
Rong Rong, I have something
to discuss with Uncle Ning.

198
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,580
Can you bring him here?

199
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,160
Okay, I’ll look for my dad now.

200

Let’s meet tonight. Is that okay?

201
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,300
No problem. Thank you, then.

202
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,360
Not at all. “Thank you” is not for us.

203
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,940
Oh, right. Remember to keep it a secret.

204
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,460
Don’t worry.

205

Hey, you!

206
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,840
You sounded so affectionate.

207
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,080
If someone heard it,

208
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,900
they would thought that
you two has a special relation.

209
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:13,440
Fatty! Stop saying nonsense in front of Xiao Wu.
I’m leaving.

210

<i>This voice sounds familiar.</i>
