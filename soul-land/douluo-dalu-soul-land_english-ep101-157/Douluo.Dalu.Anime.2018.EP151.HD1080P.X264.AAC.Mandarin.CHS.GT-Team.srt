<i>instinctively keeping distance from me.</i>

69

71

But Brother San,

73
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,890
why did we have to give the money
I brought back from the Martial Soul Main Hall

74
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,850
to the Ironsmiths Society?

75
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,100
That is money from the people of Gengxin Town.

76
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,640
They should give it back to the people.

77
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,850
Also because of this,

78
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,310
the Ironsmiths Society

79
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,140
agreed to sell us

80
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,810

00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,970

the item’s defense is.

85
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,890

86
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:08,850
that this flexible armor

87
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,520
can withstand any frontal attack

88
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,520
from a soul master less than Level 60.

89
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,270

Besides, Senior Lou Gao

96
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,640
promised to keep making this kind of armor for us.

97
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:52,640
I’ll ask him

98
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,970
for another one then.

99
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,930
We should call him Elder Lou Gao

100
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,930
now that he’s a part of Tang Clan.

101

Elder Lou Gao.

102
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,020
Are you alright?

103
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,350
Chief.

104
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,060
What was the metal

105
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,350
you found

106
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,270
that could make

107
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,720
the Storm Pear Blossom Needle?

108
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,240
Is it the Essence of Cold Iron?

109
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,700
Tai Tan and I already looked into it.

110
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,570
In order to make the Storm Pear Blossom Needle,

111
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,360
we need at least two kilograms
of the Essence of Cold Iron.

112
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,150
But there’s not enough

113
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,490
in the whole Gengxin Town.

114
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,700
How did you find it?

115
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,700
Those ores were mixed in with the pure iron.

116
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,240
The owner didn’t recognize them.

117
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,820
But soul masters with the Qibao Amber Pagoda
as their martial soul

118
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,700
have a strong ability for treasure appraisal.

119
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,360
But to make the Storm Pear Blossom Needle,

120
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,400
the Essence of Cold Iron is hard enough

121
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,820
but not tenacious enough.

122
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,990
Why don’t we use the core of Deep Sea Silver instead?

123
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,200
Chief.

124
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,450
I am more than 60% certain

125
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:10,110
that we can make this peerless hidden weapon.

126
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:10,990
Senior.

127
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,700
I understand how you feel.

128
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,070
But the core of Deep Sea Silver

129
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,320
can’t be melted by any kind of flame.

130
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,740
It must be hammered by hand.

131
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,320
However, with the power we have right now,

132
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,240
it’ll be difficult to cast it.

133
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,780
My old master might be the only one

134
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,860
who can do it.

135
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,360
Let me

136
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,570
take care of this problem.

138

we brought back

173
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,286
a top-tier craftsman.

174
00:11:44,866 --> 00:11:46,576
This is Elder Lou Gao,

175
00:11:46,576 --> 00:11:48,996
the former president of the Ironsmiths Society.

176
00:11:48,996 --> 00:11:49,706
He is now

177
00:11:49,706 --> 00:11:50,996
also an Elder of Tang Clan.

178
00:11:52,996 --> 00:11:53,996
Clan Chief.

179
00:11:53,996 --> 00:11:55,656
Let’s talk while walking.

180
00:11:55,656 --> 00:11:56,286
Here.

181
00:11:56,286 --> 00:11:57,326
Take a look

182
00:11:57,326 --> 00:11:59,246
at what we’ve done while you were gone.

183
00:12:27,656 --> 00:12:29,786
This is so big!

184
00:12:30,746 --> 00:12:33,036
I’m surprised that you, Old Rhino

185
00:12:33,036 --> 00:12:35,746
has already built the clan.

186
00:12:35,746 --> 00:12:38,036
Tang Clan is currently built

187
00:12:38,036 --> 00:12:40,456
to hold 1,500 people.

188
00:12:40,456 --> 00:12:42,406
As the clan grows,

189
00:12:42,406 --> 00:12:43,706
we can keep expanding.

190
00:12:44,996 --> 00:12:45,956
Clan Chief.

191
00:12:46,206 --> 00:12:47,656
Tang Clan buildings

192
00:12:47,656 --> 00:12:49,366
are currently divided into five sections.

193
00:12:49,906 --> 00:12:51,366
The east, south, west, and north

194
00:12:51,366 --> 00:12:53,076
are the four tribes’ quarters.

195
00:12:53,286 --> 00:12:56,206
The Chief’s Mansion is in the middle.

196
00:12:57,156 --> 00:12:58,536
All of the buildings

197
00:12:58,536 --> 00:13:00,496
have been strengthened

198
00:13:00,496 --> 00:13:02,826
and have places to fire hidden weapons.

199
00:13:02,826 --> 00:13:04,156
Once the clan is attacked,

200
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:05,906
all soul masters

201
00:13:05,906 --> 00:13:07,996
can get to the battle positions immediately.

202
00:13:08,286 --> 00:13:09,366
The Tribe of Defense

203
00:13:09,366 --> 00:13:11,076
really is the top architect.

204
00:13:11,406 --> 00:13:12,536
You’ve finished building a huge complex

205
00:13:12,536 --> 00:13:14,866
in such short time.

206
00:13:16,116 --> 00:13:17,576
It’s a pity we didn’t redesign and build

207
00:13:17,576 --> 00:13:19,656
the outer walls.

208
00:13:20,116 --> 00:13:21,366
Or else, I’m confident

209
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:23,826
we could make Tang Clan into a fortress.

210
00:13:24,956 --> 00:13:25,826
Elder Niu Gao.

211
00:13:26,036 --> 00:13:27,456
You’ve done an amazing job already.

212
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,786
Based on the current state
of the soul masters’ world,

213
00:13:29,786 --> 00:13:31,786
we don’t need to publicize Tang Clan for now.

214
00:13:31,786 --> 00:13:33,286
The four single attribute tribes

215
00:13:33,286 --> 00:13:34,706
are all the foundations of Tang Clan.

216
00:13:34,826 --> 00:13:35,706
From now on,

217
00:13:35,706 --> 00:13:37,866
I will need all of your help and effort

218
00:13:37,866 --> 00:13:39,656
to grow and expand Tang Clan.

219
00:13:40,706 --> 00:13:41,656
Clan Chief.

220
00:13:41,656 --> 00:13:43,366
No need to be polite with us.

221
00:13:43,576 --> 00:13:45,406
We need you to lead the way

222
00:13:45,406 --> 00:13:47,496
in the future development of the clan.

223
00:14:05,826 --> 00:14:07,206
I have a suggestion

224
00:14:07,206 --> 00:14:09,156
that I’d like to discuss with all of you.

225
00:14:09,456 --> 00:14:12,326
I’d like to change the names of
the four single attribute tribes,

226
00:14:12,326 --> 00:14:14,906
and also give each elder a specific role.

227
00:14:15,156 --> 00:14:15,956
Clan Chief.

228
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:17,746
Please give us more details.

229
00:14:18,246 --> 00:14:19,366
My plan

230
00:14:19,366 --> 00:14:22,246
is to change the four tribes into four halls.

231
00:14:22,246 --> 00:14:24,206
Each elder will be the leader of one hall.

232
00:14:24,456 --> 00:14:25,576
The Tribe of Destruction

233
00:14:25,576 --> 00:14:26,866
will now be the Hall of Medicine,

234
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,906
responsible for making medicine

235
00:14:27,906 --> 00:14:29,156
and the clan’s defense.

236
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:30,156
Hall of Strength

237
00:14:30,156 --> 00:14:31,406
will be responsible for making hidden weapons.

238
00:14:31,786 --> 00:14:32,786
Hall of Defense

239
00:14:32,786 --> 00:14:34,746
will lead the clan’s defense and construction.

240
00:14:35,156 --> 00:14:35,996
Hall of Agility

241
00:14:35,996 --> 00:14:37,746
will focus on intelligence and scouting.

242
00:14:40,326 --> 00:14:41,536
Elder Lou Gao

243
00:14:41,536 --> 00:14:44,036
will be responsible for making
all hidden weapons for the clan.

244
00:14:44,036 --> 00:14:44,996
I believe

245
00:14:44,996 --> 00:14:47,326
that among all hidden weapons we make,

246
00:14:47,326 --> 00:14:49,076
the ones engraved with two words “Lou Gao”

247
00:14:49,206 --> 00:14:50,866
will be the top tier.

248
00:14:52,246 --> 00:14:52,956
Alright.

249
00:14:52,956 --> 00:14:54,366
That’s the plan.

250
00:14:54,906 --> 00:14:55,786
Also,

251
00:14:55,786 --> 00:14:57,786
we will add a Hall of Martial Arts
for fighting against enemies.

252
00:14:57,786 --> 00:14:59,206
Ma Hong Jun will lead it.

253
00:15:00,406 --> 00:15:01,656
Logistics and finance

254
00:15:01,786 --> 00:15:04,206
will be managed by Oscar and Ning Rong Rong.

255
00:15:04,206 --> 00:15:05,156
Lastly,

256
00:15:05,576 --> 00:15:07,156
I think it’s time to tell everyone

257
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,286
her identity.

258
00:15:09,286 --> 00:15:10,206
Xiao Wu.

259
00:15:10,706 --> 00:15:11,906
My love.

260
00:15:12,366 --> 00:15:14,246
She is a Century Millennium Soul Beast

261
00:15:14,786 --> 00:15:16,456
like my mother.

262
00:15:18,746 --> 00:15:20,206
She sacrificed herself

263
00:15:20,576 --> 00:15:22,206
to save me.

264
00:15:22,576 --> 00:15:24,536
Thankfully, with the help of two celestial goods,

265
00:15:24,536 --> 00:15:26,456
she has become human again.

266
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:28,156
But her soul

267
00:15:28,156 --> 00:15:29,906
has emerged with my sixth soul ring

268
00:15:29,906 --> 00:15:31,906
during the sacrifice.

269
00:15:38,536 --> 00:15:40,866
Besides Xiao Wu, everyone else here

270
00:15:40,866 --> 00:15:41,906
will are all members of the Hall of Discussion.

271
00:15:42,246 --> 00:15:43,866
Any important matters of the clan

272
00:15:43,866 --> 00:15:44,956
will be discussed and voted

273
00:15:44,956 --> 00:15:46,116
by all of us.

274
00:15:46,116 --> 00:15:47,326
Everyone will have one vote.

275
00:15:47,326 --> 00:15:48,156
Elders,

276
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:49,156
do you have any suggestions?

277
00:15:49,496 --> 00:15:51,616
Chief, your plans are well-organized.

278
00:15:51,956 --> 00:15:53,996
My only opinion

279
00:15:54,156 --> 00:15:57,746
is that you have too little power.

280
00:15:58,116 --> 00:15:59,366
I suggest

281
00:15:59,576 --> 00:16:02,246
giving our chief two votes.

282
00:16:02,706 --> 00:16:05,656
Just consider it Xiao Wu’s vote.

283
00:16:05,906 --> 00:16:06,786
At the same time,

284
00:16:06,996 --> 00:16:09,576
the Clan Chief can veto any decision.

285
00:16:12,746 --> 00:16:14,206
Now that the structure

286
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:15,826
and responsibilities are clear,

287
00:16:15,826 --> 00:16:17,826
we can start to operate the clan soon.

288
00:16:18,206 --> 00:16:19,286
By then,

289
00:16:19,286 --> 00:16:21,996
even if the Martial Soul Hall
finds out about Tang Clan,

290
00:16:21,996 --> 00:16:23,706
they won’t be able to attack us easily.

291
00:16:24,406 --> 00:16:26,286
Speaking of the Martial Soul Hall...

292
00:16:26,746 --> 00:16:27,786
Clan Chief,

293
00:16:28,116 --> 00:16:29,036
our people

294
00:16:29,036 --> 00:16:30,456
found that

295
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,826
over a thousand soul masters

296
00:16:31,826 --> 00:16:33,406
has come into the city recently.

297
00:16:34,246 --> 00:16:35,406
That many?

298
00:16:36,536 --> 00:16:37,786
It seems like something big

299
00:16:37,786 --> 00:16:38,786
is going to happen.

300
00:16:39,406 --> 00:16:40,366
Let’s do this.

301
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:40,996
Little Ao.

302
00:16:40,996 --> 00:16:41,906
You and Rong Rong

303
00:16:41,906 --> 00:16:42,996
go back to the Qibao Amber Tribe

304
00:16:42,996 --> 00:16:43,956
to visit Uncle Ning.

305
00:16:43,956 --> 00:16:44,746
Fatty and I

306
00:16:44,746 --> 00:16:46,076
will go back to our school.

307
00:17:02,156 --> 00:17:03,996
Gengxin Town.

308
00:17:05,205 --> 00:17:06,905
Tang San.

309
00:17:07,746 --> 00:17:09,286
Send my orders.

310
00:17:09,286 --> 00:17:11,286
We will execute the plan earlier.

311
00:17:35,076 --> 00:17:36,206
Among the soldiers on horseback,

312
00:17:36,206 --> 00:17:37,746
nobody was dressed like a royal.

313
00:17:38,116 --> 00:17:40,076
Why do them dare to charge through the street?

314
00:17:41,576 --> 00:17:43,706
Are they on an emergency mission?

315
00:17:43,706 --> 00:17:44,206
Fatty.

316
00:17:44,206 --> 00:17:45,326
Let’s walk faster.
