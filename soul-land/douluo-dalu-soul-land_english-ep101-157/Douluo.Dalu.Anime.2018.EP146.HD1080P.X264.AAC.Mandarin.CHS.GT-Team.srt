He pissed Xiao Wu off.

52
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,799
The first move of Eight Flinging
is already this cruel.

53
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,399
Here comes the eighth one.

54

68
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,639
That’s because of the second skill

No.

No, he asked me to tell you

110

This fight

114
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,679
has stopped Old Goat from being stubborn,

115
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,479
but it has also cost him his confidence.

116

Well, in some ways

You...

214

You are willing to give it to me?

215
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,399
Yes,

217

I didn’t have to fight with you and lose.

224

00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,279
than my Crystal Bloody Dragon Ginseng?

231
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,119
Old White Bird,

232
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,759
you did conspire with him against me,

233
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,199
didn’t you?

234
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,759
Alright, forget about it.

235
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,479
Your piece may be more valuable,

236
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,679
but, as for me,

237
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,279
this one is priceless.

238
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,039
Now that I have it,

239
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,199
I don’t need to worry

240
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,759
about getting poisoned
when refining any medicine.

241

variations of many medicines.

I could even sacrifice myself to get it.

244
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,199
So,

[Next episode]

345
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,439
Are there any changes

346
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,999
in Tian Dou City during our absence?

347
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,279
I heard Uncle Ning said that

348
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,799
it was quite intense

349
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,679
in the royal family.

350
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,039
Emperor Xue Ye is seriously ill,

351
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,599
and no royal physicians knows what to do.

352
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,639
Maybe

353
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,110
something big is about to happen.

354
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,279
Are you going to keep doing this?

355
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,079
Tang San.

356
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,359
It’s quite painful

357
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,959
to deal with you.

358
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,839
I came here for negotiation this time.

359
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,959
Clearly, you guys barged in

360
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,999
by hurting the guarding students.

361
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,399
Let’s fight again

362
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,199
if you are not convinced.

363
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:45,919
Please

364
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,910
don’t disturb our school anymore.
