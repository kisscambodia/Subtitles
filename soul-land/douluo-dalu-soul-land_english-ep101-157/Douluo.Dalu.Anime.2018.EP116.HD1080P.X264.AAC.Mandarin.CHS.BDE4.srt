[Previous Episode]
I want to team up with you.

32
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,060
If one’s able
to pass through Hell Road,

33
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,650
he’ll be recognised by one special domain.

34
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,040
Death God Domain?

35
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,120
Is this the reason why
father asked me to come here for?

36
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,420
Eat it if you trust me.

37
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,060
I do. Please trust me too.

38
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,250
I hereby specially bestowed upon you
the title of Death God.

39
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,790
Looks like he doesn’t want us to obtain
the Death God Domain.

40
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,790
Please open the entrance of Hell Road.

41
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,810
I’ll pass through Hell Road
with Emissary of Hell.

00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,630

[Soul Land]
[Episode 116]

44
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:30,140
The heinous spirit is invigorating.

45
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,240
This is Hell Road?

46
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,950
I wonder what’s down there?

47
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,520
It’s Netherland Shot.

48
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,850
No. I’d rather say
it’s Netherland stockpile

49
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,950
due to its massive volume.

50
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:56,730
I think it’s the cemetery of losers
in Slaughter City over the years.

51
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,880
Perhaps Hell Road
is the core of Slaughter City.

52
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,320
Or

53
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,620
it’s the energy source of Slaughter City.

54
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,040
If this place collapsed,

55
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,080
it’ll bring disastrous catastrophe
to the whole Slaughter City.

56
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,720
Speaking of which,

57
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,600
Slaughter City should
have collapsed earlier.

58
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,160
However, Martial Soul Hall
acquiesces with Slaughter City’s evil,

59
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,790
Is sheltering those degenerates
your real intention?

60
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:23,870
I knew Hao Tian Tribe has
prejudice against Martial Soul Hall.

61
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,250
But I’ve no rights
to decide on those matters.

62
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,180
It’s better to settle the obstacle
we’re facing now.

63
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,210
Go up. Netherland is poisonous.

64
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,900
Possibly rare beasts exist down there.

65
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,560
Don’t you have the antidote
to cure poison?

66
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,760
I think the downside path is more secure.

67
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,590
There’s no antidote that can
prevent every poison.

68
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,740
It’s better to go up.

69
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,110
For the sake of our safety.

70
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,920
You prefer the front or rear?

71
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,060
Let’s go.

72
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,790
Don’t you feel
it’s getting hotter and hotter?

73
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,240
If I’m not wrong,

74
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,710
it’s because we’re approaching
Netherland down there.

75
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:25,130
How could it be?
I didn’t feel any gradient.

76
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,540
At first, we’re 1000 metres
higher than Netherland.

77
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,440
But, now it has decreased to 900 metres.

78
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,080
If the temperature keeps increasing,

79
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,410
the last part of the path

80
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,700
would have been sunk by Netherland.

81
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,760
And it should be
the most challenging path.

82
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,290
[You’ve harmed me.]
You’ve harmed me.

83
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,730
There’re many dead bodies here.

84
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,720
This must have been carved by him
before he died.

85
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,000
It seemed that they died of distrust.

86
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:09,160
Those who collaborated to challenge
Hell Road had their own agendas.

87
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,590
Is not surprising.

88
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,350
You don’t trust me?

89
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,580
There’s a sound.

90
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,070
Sound? What is it?

91
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,490
They’re here.

92
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,640
Bats.

93
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:27,040
Those bats are hesitant to launch attack.

94
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,690
They seem to be intelligent.

95
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,310
Let’s try them out.

96
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,990
Amazing speed and keenness.

97
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,830
They must have been mutated.

98
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,520
Unless our speed
surpass their limit of reaction,

99
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,120
otherwise, it’s hard to defeat them.

<i>and also limits the speed of

Current terrain is suppressive for us.

Hence, we can’t attack simultaneously.

164
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,700
Tie the rope at your tail.

165
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,960
Then...

166
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,940
<i>Wonder where’s the weakness?</i>

167
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,180
Be careful. It’ll grow stronger
after every regeneration.

168
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,670
Tang Yin!

169
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,860
<i>Wisdom Skull.</i>

170
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,550
<i>I got it.</i>

171
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,200
<i>Purple God Light.</i>

172
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,580
<i>Striking the three heads simultaneously</i>

173
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,560
<i>is the only way to halt
its ability to regenerate.</i>

174
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,780
<i>And this is its weakness too.</i>

175
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,560
Do you want to take a rest?

176
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,660
Well. We’re quite exhausted.

177
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,010
And we still don’t know
what we’ll face later.

178
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,260
From what I know,

179
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,210
there’re three trials on Hell Road.

180
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,980
Each one is impregnable than the last one.

181
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,170
Just now, we’ve passed through
the first one.

182
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,700
<i>Her fox tail is not merely a martial soul.</i>

183
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,160
<i>It’s likely to be an attacked soul bone.</i>

184
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,020
<i>The golden generation of
Martial Soul Hall is really formidable.</i>

185
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,730
[Next Episode]
This is just a beginning.

186
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,050
The moment they enter Hell Road,

187
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,820
they’ve become its prey.

188
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,280
The sound and form...

189
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,190
Could it be...

190
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,540
Tang Yin, what should we do?

191
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,580
I’ll divert its attention,

192
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,880
and you wait for a chance to attack it.

193
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,680
But, are we able to dodge

194
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,000
on this narrow path?

195
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,510
Watch out!

196
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,820
Tang Yin, don’t you want your life?

197
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,980
Kill or to be killed,

198
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,300
what’s your choice?

199
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,970
He can’t persist anymore.
