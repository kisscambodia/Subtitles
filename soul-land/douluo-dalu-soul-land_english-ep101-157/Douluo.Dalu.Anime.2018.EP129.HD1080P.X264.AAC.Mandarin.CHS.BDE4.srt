the only one of the Shrek Seven Devils here.

168
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,450
He’ll become the focus
of the whole school.

169
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:12,310
By that time, it’ll be easy for him
to hook up with some pretty girls.

170
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,610
Am I right, Fatty?

171
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,570
Nonsense, I’m a decent man.

172
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,880
Zhu Qing and I will stay
for a few more days

173
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,560
before going back to Xing Luo Empire.

174
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,790
I’m going back to the tribe.

175
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,420
It’s so late at night.
yet some disciples are still practicing.

176
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,290
They’ve been working so hard
under Rong Rong’s lead.

177
00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:01,200
It seems that our tribe is thriving.

178
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,120
Recently, Tribe Chief
has been strict in patrolling.

179
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,390
It’s tiring.

180
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,810
I feel something is behind us.

181
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,080
Nothing.

182
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,780
I’ll take a look.

183
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,360
What about you, Little San?

184
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,040
Firstly, I’ll go find Xiao Wu.

185
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,090
Then get the sixth soul ring.

186
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,330
As for the rest,
I’ll think of it when I find Xiao Wu.

187
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:02,080
If you have nowhere to go,
come back then.

188
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,360
This school always welcome you all
with open arms.

189
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,490
Even Martial Soul Hall would have to
think it over if they want to harm us.

190
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,800
After all,

191
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,720
they don’t dare to turn against the two empires.

192
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,570
Little San, when are you leaving?

193
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,470
Tomorrow, early in the morning, Master.

194
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,920
I’m worried about Xiao Wu.

195
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,540
We’ve been parted for five years,
I wonder how she’s doing.

196
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,460
Hopefully, every one of the Shrek Seven Devils

197
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,680
could get together next time.

198
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:43,860
Little San, although your current soul power
is lower than mine,

199
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,990
your strength is still better than mine.

200
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:48,200
Hope that you’ll surpass Little Ao and me

201
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,350
in the next gathering.

202
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,020
You’d better work hard.

203
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:58,390
My current strength is
beyond what you’ve seen today.

204
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:05,030
I really look forward to seeing you all
become Grand Soul Land Masters.

205
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,240
What’s wrong, Rong Rong?

206
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:15,039
I don’t know why my head
suddenly hurt.

207
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,790
I’m alright.

208
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,040
Report to Tribe Chief. Hurry up.

209
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,050
Yes.

210
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:49,490
Stupid. Always drop the ball.

211
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,800
Change of plan. Attack.
