Please allow me

00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,540
to acknowledge my ancestors.

33

Absurd.

34
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,520
Never even think of returning to the tribe

35
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,610
after what your father has done.

36
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,950
It’s Father’s fault to involve the tribe.
And I’ve apologised for that.

37
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,630
But, you’ve humiliated my mom.

38
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,740
I must get the justice back.

39

You despise the tribe,

[Episode 125]

42
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,400
That year, Tang Hao left the tribe

43
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,360
and brought away the two soul bones
given to him by the tribe.

44
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,090
Now, he ordered Tang San
to acknowledge the ancestors

45
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,500
and bring back the two soul bones.

46
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,350
I reckon this can prove his remorse.

47
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,780
Removing soul bones from a living man?

48
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,840
After all, he’s the son
of the last Tribe Chief.

49
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,140
It seems that
he hasn’t forgotten about the tribe.

50
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,670
These soul bones are the most precious
treasures of the tribe.

51
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,480
I hereby hand them over to you for safekeeping.

This is one of
the three soul bones he has.

73
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:08,360
Three pieces?
He’s indeed a little freak.

162
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:53,320
Where’s that brat?
Has he been broken by me?

163
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,820
How did he get up here?

164
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,360
Did you save him, Tribe Chief?

165
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,090
He got up by himself.

166
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:05,910
That’s out of the question.
Under the full attack of Tool Soul Form,

167
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,530
he must have been injured severely.

168
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,390
Face it.

169
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,370
We’ve witnessed it.

170
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,560
If I’m not wrong,

171
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,790
he has the ability of flying.

172
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,790
- He didn’t use it in the duel.
- But...

173
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:25,150
Enough. You broke your promise in the duel.

174
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:29,400
You’ve lost.

175
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,680
<i>What’s going on?
My soul skill has been forcibly cut off.</i>

176
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,220
<i>It’s due to the domain resulted from the
scattering of Blue Silver Tyrant Spear.</i>

177
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,720
<i>No way.
I must get off from this deadlock.</i>

178
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,720
A bet is a bet. Since I’ve lost,

179
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,590
I’ll do as I promised him.

180
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:07,290
Dismiss, everyone.
Return to your practice.

181
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,750
Yes.

182
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,940
Yue Hua,

183
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,920
you can prepare for the ceremony now.

184
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:21,070
Thank you for your approval, Tribe Elders.

185
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:27,880
It’s not that we approve it,
but Tang San himself earned it.

186
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,060
I have never seen
such an outstanding young man.

187
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,560
I hope he won’t go off track in the future.

188
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,460
Don’t make his father’s mistake.

189
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:45,240
Tribe Elders, Hao Tian Tribe
has gone into hiding for years.

190
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,360
Is it time to lift the ban?

191
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:54,360
Tribe Chief, do you mean...

192
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,640
It has been 20 years.

193
00:16:56,650 --> 00:17:00,890
It’s time for Hao Tian Hammer
to reemerge in the soul masters’ world.

194
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:04,839
You have repeatedly request me
to lift the ban, no?

195
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:10,029
I think now it’s time.

196
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,550
I don’t agree.

197
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,730
I reckon,

198
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:18,270
we should continue
to stay low for a while.

199
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,630
Because of Little San?

200
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:27,099
Yes. Hao Tian Tribe needs a leader
who can lead the tribe to forge ahead.

201
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:31,390
We’ve grown old and so have you.

202
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:35,100
But it’s a different case for him.

203
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,590
He’s so talented.

204
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:43,050
We must not neglect him
due to the reemergence of the tribe.

205
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:46,490
He needs training and guidance.

206
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,510
The tribe should stay put

207
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:52,280
to provide him with better training.

208
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,360
Second Uncle, have you forgiven
Brother Hao?

209
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,740
No, don’t you remember
the three requests I mentioned before?

210
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,840
If he can accomplish all of them,

211
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,560
it means that he’s qualified
to be your successor.

[Next Episode]
It has been five years.

223
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,410
I wonder how they are doing.

224
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,780
You should leave here if you know better.

225
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,990
Otherwise, I won’t let you off easily.

226
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,790
Who dares to pretend
to be our little freaks?

227
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,300
With my capability, do I have to

228
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,370
learn anymore?

229
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,730
After five years, you’re much cockier.

230
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,190
It seems that we really

231
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,950
impressed our school.

232
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:46,120
Who are you?

233
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,980
What have you done to Little San?

234
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,620
Take him down.

235
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,450
You have no way to escape.
