No!

Attack him.

64
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,950
If your level hadn’t ascended,

65
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,790
you wouldn’t have been able to
take the first three attacks.

66
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,750
You have no way to escape, Tang San.

67
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,830
Ah Yin, do you feel that too?

68
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,880
Little San,

69

No!

71

72
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,700
Is there nothing else you can do?

<i>I won’t let your plan succeed.</i>

89
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,370
What’s going on?

90
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,410
That direction...

91
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,750
Could it be...

92
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,660
What happened just now?

93
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,750
I heard that
when a Century Millennium Soul Beast perishes,

94
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,620
it will create a strong magnetic field.

95
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,590
No way! The Century Millennium Soul Ring...

96
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,560
We have no chance anymore.

97
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:03,040
Is she going to sacrifice herself?

98
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,600
- It happened to Tang San’s mother too...
- It’s different.

99
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,620
This Flexible Bunny

100
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,510
has used a more deadly way.

101
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,270
She sacrifices not only her life,
but also her soul.

102
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:19,160
Pardon? Sacrificing her soul?

103
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,530
She has assimilated her soul into the ring

104
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,510
and handed herself over to Tang San.

105
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,270
Under such situation,

106
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,190
regardless of Tang San’s strength

107
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,000
or whether he has reached the level
which needs the soul ring,

108
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,980
the fusion of him and this soul ring
will definitely succeed.

109
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,250
Tang San is different from Tang Hao,

110
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,570
he is far from being a Grand Soul Land Master.

111
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:59,330
It’s impossible to absorb
the Century Millennium Soul Ring by himself.

112
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,330
How about Xiao Wu?

113
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:06,580
She will never be reborn again.

114
