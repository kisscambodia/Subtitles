Lord Hao Tian?

45
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,620
<i>Worthy of being The Grand Hao Tian Master.</i>

46
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:24,030
Tang Hao, how dare you be rude
before The Sacred Temple.

47
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:39,600
The Sacred Temple? The imperious one.

48
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:53,180
Look carefully, this is the real Hao Tian Form.

49
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,840
How dare you, Tang Hao.

<i>The power Hao Tian Hammer is overwhelming.</i>

<i>What Martial Soul Hall has owed me,</i>

<i>I want you to repay all one day.</i>

<i>I’ll never forget.</i>

He took away Little San and Xiao Wu.

59
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:17,000
Tang Hao only suffered slight injury
from the attack of Martial Soul Hall.

60
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,270
He crushed the crucial statue of Martial Soul Hall.

61
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,490
The Pope is not his target,

62
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,550
but The Sacred Temple,
which is a symbol of Martial Soul Hall.

63
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,100
Qibao Form.

64
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:53,600
He took away the Century Millennium Soul Beast.

65
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,260
Your Holiness...

66
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,520
No need to chase Tang Hao. He’s too robust.

67
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,640
I’ve been practising these years

68
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,540
and finally reaching the level of
the Grand Soul Land Master.

69
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:13,070
But, when we are confronting with Tang Hao,
he’s just too oppressive.

70
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,620
This bastard is too rampant.

71
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,880
Your Holiness, it concerns
the dignity of Martial Soul Hall.

72
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,200
If we can tackle Tang Hao easily,

73
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,000
how could he live until now?

74
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,060
It’s not the time yet.

75
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,210
How about them?

76
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:35,660
Let them leave Martial Soul Hall now.

77
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,990
Let’s go.

78
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:53,950
Tang Hao, we’ll settle our hatred one day.

79
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,400
Little San’s dad is awesome.

80
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,200
I’ve decided to make him my role model.

81
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,790
If it wasn’t Tang Hao’s presence,

82
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,490
perhaps none of us could have left.

83

00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,000

We want to return home

I plan to hang around on the continent.

105
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,430
Afterwards, I’ll go back to school to help out.

106

I’ve never expected you brat...

107

All of you are great.

You’ll be successful wherever you go.

Qibao Amber Tribe always

111
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,520
welcomes you with open arms.

112
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,090
Please don’t be sad to say farewell.

113
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,800
It’s hard for me to say goodbye.

114
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,260
In those days we were practising,

115
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,030
I always thought it was too long and tedious.

116
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:48,620
In fact, it’s the greatest moment to be with you all.

117
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:53,200
Same here. I can’t believe we’re parting now.

Sadly, Little San and Xiao Wu aren’t here.

123
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,820
I’m curious about how they are now.

124

<i>This is Brother San’s father?</i>

You’re awake?

00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,630
Thank you.

134
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:00,480
That’s fine. As a soul master,

135
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,720
I should lock you up

136
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,750
and kill you

137
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,430
when Tang San needs you.

138
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:10,330
Give him your soul ring and soul bone.

139
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,850
But, as a father,

140
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,380
I would make another choice.

141
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:22,160
Is it because of my relationship with Little San?

142
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,600
Girl, do you know

143
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,720
Tang San’s mother is the same as you.

144
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,700
She’s a Century Millennium Soul Beast too.

145
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,160
You should go now.

146
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,400
Little San will get into trouble if you stay with him.

147
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,120
Do you oppose us being together?

148
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,720
No. Why would I?

149
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,780
Didn’t I make the same choice back then?

150
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,360
But, when his mother and I were together,

151
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,200
my soul power has transcended Level 70.

152
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,840
Both of your levels are too low.

153
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,030
<i>At least, his father isn’t opposing.</i>

154
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:12,250
Go, return to the place you should be.

155
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,160
That’s the safest place for you.

156
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:20,270
Back then, I thought I was strong enough.

157
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:24,640
But our ending was still a tragedy.

158
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,490
I don’t wish to see

159
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:29,770
the same tragedy happens to my child.

160
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,830
I wonder

161
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,160
when we will see them after this farewell.

162
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,320
How about we make a five-year promise?

163
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,510
Let’s meet at Shrek

164
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,110
after five years, okay?

165
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,570
Good idea.

166
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:04,140
Great. Let’s keep this promise whether rain or shine.

167
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,880
Take good care of yourselves.

168
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,610
Don’t forget to practice even after you graduated.

169
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:20,670
Well, it’s time to say goodbye.
Let’s leave Martial Soul City now.

170
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,880
Dean Frander, we’ll take our leave first.

171
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,660
Take care, Fatty.

172
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,080
Can I leave after he wakes up?

173
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:14,840
Will he let you go by then?

174
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,300
Go. Here isn’t far from Star Dou Forest.

175
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,200
You’re the first man who combs my hair

176
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,720
and the only one.

177
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,840
Forever.

178
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:28,190
Does it matter being a human or a beast?

179
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:33,210
Instead, a beast’s feeling is more sincere.

180
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,680
Dad.

181
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,060
<i>I finally meet him.</i>

182
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,260
Sit down.

183
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,560
Don’t look around. She’s gone.

184
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,680
Gone? Why?

185
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,050
Because she has to.

186
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,920
Let me ask you a question.

187
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,520
Are you able to protect her
with your current strength?

188
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,460
I...

189
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,670
[Next Episode]
Changing form?

190
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,710
Forming into human

191
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,980
is a tough journey.

192
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Death is unavoidable.

193
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,800
Dealing with Martial Soul Hall,

194
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,120
there’s no way to escape.

195
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,960
You can only live in the dark forever.

196
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,540
What’s going on?

197
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,740
We can’t be together.

198
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,720
Little Ao.

199
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:24,010
Something behind the waterfall
is responding to my spirit power.
