<i>the main reason why a soul bone</i>

46

<i>is more precious than soul ring</i>

47
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,790
<i>is due to the infinity of one’s
soul power to absorb it.</i>

48
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,830
<i>Even if the soul master is only at Level 1,</i>

00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,180
Snow on the summit is spectacular.

64

Purple Demon Eye is only one step away from

65
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000

66
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,220
You can see the summit 200 meters high?

67
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:57,360
Little San, can you tell me what’s the glow

<i>Judging from the emission,</i>

73
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,520
<i>Purple God Light is a piercing attack.</i>

74
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,850
<i>It is centralised and extremely destructive.</i>

75
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,030
<i>My spirit power is substantially
consumed when attacking,</i>

76
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,080
<i>but my soul power does not.</i>

77
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,250
<i>As expected, spirit power’s consumption
is slower when no attack is launched.</i>

78
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,160
<i>It seems like this skill is
mainly driven by spirit power.</i>

79
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,540
<i>The more the emission of spirit power,
the stronger the attack force.</i>

80
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,030
<i>These light particles are my spirit power.</i>

81
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,800
<i>It has improved at least 100 times than before.</i>

<i>Eight Spider Bone empowers my combat capability,</i>

<i>while Wisdom Skull enhances

No. I love you.

91
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,760
What did you say?

92
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,560
Initially, I didn’t care about you.

93
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,460
But, I realised

94
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,669
you’ve devoted all for me.

Everything you’ve done

96

has engraved deeply in my heart.

97
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,990
I should’ve told you the truth earlier.

98
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,890
But I had no courage to say it out.

99
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:46,800
I don’t want to hurt you or leave you.

100
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,550
Perhaps this is love.

101
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,670
Tell me, why we can’t be together?

102
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:14,540
Because of the tribe’s rules.

103
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,160
Every tribe’s disciple is
a soul master from Support Branch.

104
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,360
We can’t escape from
the truth of being lack of attack.

105
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,880
As a result, the tribe stipulates that

106
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,760
a disciple’s spouse

107
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,430
must be from Attack Branch.

108
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,250
I’m the only daughter of my dad

109

and as the future chief.

110
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,160
Hence, I have no right to change this rule.

111
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,030
We can’t be together

112
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,720
because I’m not from Attack Branch.

113
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,920
Sorry, Little Ao. I’m truly sorry.

<i>Those smooth areas are eroded by water.</i>

129

<i>I’d be able to stand firmly on the rock

begin to practice your soul power then.

Ever since the farewell of the finals,

141
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,960
I was thinking,

142
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,800
when my partners were
oppressed by Martial Soul Hall,

143
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,540
I just stared helplessly

144
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,500
and under other’s protection?

145
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,160
Now, I finally have a clear goal.

146
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,480
Qibao Amber Tribe hopes their disciples
can be sheltered under protection.

147
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,160
I know I’m a soul master
from Food Branch.

I don’t have the ability to do so.

00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,230
But it doesn’t mean it’ll be impossible for me.

150

Rong Rong, will you wait for me?

00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,700
Ten years. Wait for me for ten years.

If I don’t come back after ten years,

you may marry others.

Perhaps Oscar is not as intelligent as Tang San.

160
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,310
However, his insistence can never be doubted.

161
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:49,640
He’ll surprise us shortly.

162
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,160

163
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,760
Just let him venture.

164
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,160
<i>I’ve done. The 81st hammering.</i>

165
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:20,890
<i>It took me half a year to accomplish
all 81 hammerings.</i>

166
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:25,900
<i>Little San only spent three months...</i>

167
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,200
You’ve done great.

168
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,750
But, you should do better.

169
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,390
Next, use this to train.

170
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:49,600
If the handle breaks, make one yourself.

171
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,250
<i>What’s going on?</i>

172
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,180
<i>Though wooden hammer is light,</i>

173
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,490
<i>it received greater resistance in water
than forging hammer.</i>

174
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,760
<i>I should adjust my centre of gravity.</i>

175
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,260
<i>As expected. Skill of Random Hammering.</i>

176
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,500
<i>Comparing with forging hammer,</i>

177
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,520
<i>wooden hammer is influenced by
both buoyancy and water impulse.</i>

178
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,040
<i>So, it needs to be more precise</i>

179
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,090
<i>on the strength than forging hammer.</i>

180
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,240
Batwing Rebound.

181
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,490
[Next Episode]

182
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:55,480
I set the goal for you for four years.

183
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,850
Our plan will be hindered

184
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,960
if we can’t settle Tang Hao.

185
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,040
Evil aura is materialised.

186
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,150
Tang San.

187
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,230
The humiliation you caused to me,

188
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,320
I want you to repay with your life.

189
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,760
Purple God Light.

190
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,940
I hope you’ll come back alive.
