Seventh soul skill, martial soul form!

If a martial soul form is released,

the soul master’s body will become bigger

Even if your Brother San is impressive,

83

Your sixth soul skill is so strong.

Why did you surrender?

113
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,140
That was a form of my sixth soul skill.

114
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,770
Nothingness.

115
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,670
It allows me to avoid every physical attack

116
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,470
and weaken every energetic attack,

117
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,220
but that has nothing to do with speed.

118
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:20,900
I lost.

119
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:24,400
No.

120
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,930
Since I used my eighth soul skill

121
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,330
to increase my speed and the range of control,

122
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,800
you can also use any skill to
avoid being touched.

123
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,100
This is fair.

124
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,570
If we move on,

125
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,570
I will lose.

126
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,320

Let’s treat it as a draw.

I’ve heard about your situation from them.

135

I didn’t know that you’re Tang Hao’s son.

00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,230
Come!

Doesn’t the Tribe of Agility
hope to become stronger?

142
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,970
With Tang Clan’s secret weapons,

143
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,430
you have nothing to be afraid of.

144
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,630
I understand.

145
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,970
You have good intentions.

146
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,730
But, in these years,

147
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,130
Old Goat has been supporting me.

148
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,670
I need to consider his feelings.

149
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,330
Judging from Old Goat’s temper

150
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,030
and his resentment against Hao Tian Tribe,

151
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:51,000
I’m afraid that he won’t accept Tang Clan.

152
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,600
Senior.

153
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,500
If the Tribe of Destruction is
willing to join Tang Clan,

154
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,100
will the Tribe of Agility join too?

But Old Goat is more stubborn than both of them.

157
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,650
I know him the best.

158

He’s arrogant and obstinate.

159
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,220
If he wasn’t like that,

160
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,550
the Tribe of Destruction
wouldn’t have experienced

161
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,050
such a big loss.

162
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,250
It’s not easy

163
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,280
to persuade him.

164
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,920
Leave it to me.

165
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,550
If I succeed,

166
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,950
those Four Tribes may reunite.

Just now, that was...

173
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,120
Xiao Wu’s soul.

174
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,650
I will never use it again.

175
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,580
At least I’m sure that

176
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,420
Xiao Wu is always by my side.

177
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:10,820
This is enough.

178
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,650
As long as she actually exists,

179
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,650
I will definitely revive her.

180
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:24,620
Let’s drink!

181
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,320
This brat!

182
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,350
You!

183
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,520
One more bowl!

184
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,250
Hey!

185
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,580
Miss Bai.

186
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,620
What’s wrong?

187
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,050
Today,

188
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,650
you did well too.

189
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,180
I shouldn’t have said that
you’re an attendant of Tang San.

190
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,280
What are you doing?

191
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,620
Nothing.

192
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,950
I’ve never expected that a pretty lady
would apologize to me one day.

193
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,680
I didn’t mean that.

194
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,680
But noble girls wouldn’t

195
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,620
look at me right in the face normally.

196
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,380
Not to mention an apology.

197
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,180
How am I a noble girl?

198
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,820
People of our tribe have been living in poverty

199
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,350
for so many years.

200
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,680
We can only rely on other tribes.

201
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,020
Grandpa has to let go of his dignity
and beg others.

202
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,320
But I heard that

203
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,250
all the Four Tribes refused
the subsidies for their soul masters

204
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,520
offered by the Martial Soul Hall.

205
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,280
Who would accept their help?

206
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,550
If it wasn’t for the Martial Soul Hall,

207
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,720
we wouldn’t end up like this.

208
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,880
One day,

209
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,150
I will revitalize our tribe.

210
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,750
I’ll show all the soul masters

211
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,020
how mighty our Tribe of Agility is!

212
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,780
Do you think that

213
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,280
I’m not capable enough

214
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,520
and without self-knowledge

215
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,920
by saying these?

216
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,150
I just

217
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,020
thought of a few of my brothers.

218
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,750
Do you mean

219
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,580
Tang San

220
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,350
and...?

221
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,480
I,

222
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,220
Brother San

223
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,050
and another five friends.

224
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,380
We experienced a lot of things together.

225
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,280
They are like you too.

226
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:49,280
They have goals.

227
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,220
They have the courage and
determination to reach their goals too.

228
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,220
What about you?

229
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,350
Me?

230
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,650
I have no ambition.

231
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,620
I’ll be glad as long as I can live happily

232
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,080
without worrying about my livings.

233
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,350
But...

234
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,620
If it is for the people that I care about,

235
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,150
I will throw myself in like them.

236
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,050
I’m sorry.

237
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,020
I will never do that again.

238
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,720
Today,

239
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,380
thank you for saving me.

240
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:42,950
But it doesn’t mean anything else.

241
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,680
You’d better get rid of all your bad intentions.

242
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:46,580
Or else,

243
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,220
I will hit you whenever I see you!

244
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,980
You’re the most hardworking young man
that I’ve seen.

245
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,120
You’re overpraising me, Senior.

246
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,720
I’m just used to getting up early to practice.

247
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,150
Little San.

248
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,280
Can I call you this

249
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,980
privately?

250
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:35,950
Of course.

251
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,050
You’re the senior.

252
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,420
Actually,

253
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,550
your grandma is my biological sister.

254
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,580
Considering our relationship,

255
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,750
you should call me Granduncle.

256
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,750
My sister died at a young age.

257
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,350
We raised

258
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,420
her kids,

259
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,480
including your father.

260
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,650
Granduncle.

261
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,380
The case back then...

262
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,150
I know.

263
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,320
Your father would never offend
the Martial Soul Hall

264
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,920
out of impulse.

265
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,680
So, we didn’t really blame him.

266
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,070
But it doesn’t mean that

267
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:18,070
Old Goat will be convinced
because of their old friendship.

268
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,020
What kind of person

269
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,450
is Senior Yang Wu Di?

270
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,910
His skill

271
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,420
is the strongest among us, the four leaders.

272
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,480
Neither Old Gorilla’s power,

273
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,580
nor Old Rhino defense,

274
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,450
nor my agility

275
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,650
can defeat his destruction.

276
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,820
Besides, they have
their pharmaceutical techniques.

277
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,080
Pharmaceutical techniques?

278
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,180
Drugs?

279
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,580
Granduncle.

280
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,250
You mean that...

281
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,620
Old Goat is into drug production.

282
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,920
to the point where he forgets to sleep and eat.

283
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,520
Your strength now

284
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,120
can’t be compared to his.

285
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,380
To convince him,

286
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,350
you have to start with drugs.

287
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,350
This is

288
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,980
an heirloom of the Tribe of Agility.

289
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,080
I’ve been hiding it

290
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,580
from Old Goat.

291
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,580
Take it.

292
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,350
It might help you.

293
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,350
Crystal Bloody Dragon?

294
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,750
It grows from the eighth grade

295
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,620
and evolves for ten thousand years.

296
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:24,320
This is

297
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,850
a 5,000-year-old
Crystal Bloody Dragon Ginseng.

298
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,180
Five thousand years later,

299
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,550
it will evolve into the ninth grade.

300
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,020

301

This is a gift from your granduncle.

The future of the Tribe of Agility

308
