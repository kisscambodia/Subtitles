Seems like my guess was right.

There’s a high possibility that
you will obtain a special skill.

Uncle Ning.

51
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,420
I have an important matter

52
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,600
to discuss with the Qibao Amber Tribe.

53
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,970
But, I don’t want to involve the Tian Dou Empire.

54
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,590
Is it okay?

55
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,840
Little San, just get to the point.

Outsiders can’t hear our conversation.

Whenever we meet,

00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,940
you always bring me a big surprise.

Same for this time.

62
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,860
You are much prettier, yet I’m uglier.

63
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,420
No. You have become more mature.

I would gain courage.

70

This time, I will definitely get
Chief Ning’s consent this time.

71

It’s all your fault. They will make fun of me.

Uncle Ning, that’s a deal.

Today onward, Tang Clan
will rely on your support.

This is mutually beneficial cooperation.

79
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,270
When Tang Clan is settled down,

80
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,970
I’ll send you the resources
that you need secretly.

81
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,710
Ask Rong Rong to drop me a message
if you need anything.

I’m sorry,

166
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,520
Chief Ning.

167
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,830
I can’t promise you.

168
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,180
Little Ao.

169
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,810

I’m willing to love her with everything I have.

170
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,240
But, Tang San is a good brother of mine.

171
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,020
Now, he needs my help.

172

I won’t give up on Rong Rong either.

I’ll definitely persuade you in my own way.

Little Ao is right.

Dad, we, the Shrek Seven Devils, are one.

180

Brother San is setting up Tang Clan

181
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,120
to revive Xiao Wu and take revenge
on Martial Soul Hall.

Though your answer is very tricky,

185
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,640
I must admit that

186
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,080

Chief Ning, you...

188
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,420
Why are you still calling me Chief Ning?

189
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,920
Call him your father-in-law!

190

It’s too early for that.

Uncle Ning.

194

Rong Rong! Rong Rong!

195
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,060
Xiao Wu, Tang Clan has just gained much assistance.

196
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,230
But, it’s still far from enough for us

197
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:46,690
to reach our goal.

198
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,260
Time to meet my old friend.

199
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,460
Young Master.

200
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,180
Senior.

201
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,330
Martial Soul Hall is too cruel.

202
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,610
They not only made Master
wandering for half of his life,

203
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,010
but also attacked you over and over again.

204
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,780
Master, I’ve been waiting for you to come back.

205
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,610
But, you…

206
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,920
Senior.

207
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,970
My father can finally live peacefully
with my mother.

208
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,750
It’s a relief to him.

209
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,830
I’m here to discuss something with you.

210
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,550
Young Master, please.

211
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,680
I won’t refuse
as long as it’s within my capability.

212
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:11,320
I’m planning to set up a clan, named Tang Clan.

213
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,470
I hope you
and Tribe of Strength can support me.

214
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,690
When Hao Tian Tribe is back,

215
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,360
will it be merged with Tang Clan?

216
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,610
If yes... Sorry, I have to refuse.

217
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:29,090
Tribe of Strength won’t be
a subsidiary of Hao Tian Tribe again.

218
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,190
Don’t worry.

219
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,510
Since I’m building up a power of my own,

220
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,610
I won’t merge with Hao Tian Tribe.

221
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,960

Senior Tai Tan will be
a Chief Elder of Tang Clan.

227

Tang Clan as soon as possible.
