00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:02,000
There’s no way out.

165
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,170
Collapse.

166
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,560
Slaughter City.

167
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,220
When the full moon turns obscure,

00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,210

169
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,840
Last warning.

170
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,140
This is the only chance.
