49
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,610
Uncle Tai Tan,

50
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,610
what did you give to my teacher?

51
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,780
He hasn’t been eating

52
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,840
or sleeping for two days.

53
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,410
He’s obsessed with that blueprint.

54
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,980
To be honest,

55
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,180
I’m worried about

56
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,380
letting him go alone.

57
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,180
I’ve discussed it with Si Di.

58
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,540
We’ll send two Grand Iron Masters to look after him.

59
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,310
There’s only a fine line between a Grand Iron Master
and the God of Ironsmith.

60
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,340
With them

61
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,610
and Lou Gao, such a great artisan,

62
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,610
we Tang Clan will be like a tiger with added wings.

63
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,340
You may rest assured.

64
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,110
We will do whatever we can to make them feel at home.

65
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,880
We’re back.

66
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,410
Brother San,

67
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,410
we’re back with fruitful results this time.

68
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,110
This is...

69
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,510
Lath-like gold!

70
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,210
The purity is even higher than the one I got before.

71
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,210
This must be the Dragon Beard Needle.

72
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,640
This lath-like gold

73
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,640
can make at least a thousand Dragon Beard Needles.

74
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,480
It’s freezing.

75
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,180
Miss Ning,

76
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,810
may I have a look at it?

77
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,410
Si Long’s martial soul is Supreme Chisel.

78
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,410
He’s best at

79
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,210
identifying different types of minerals

80
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,010
and casting exquisite objects.

81
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,180
He’s got at least eighty percent of Lou Gao’s skills.

82
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,380
In casting communities,

83
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,710
he holds a high social status.

84
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,280
Extremely high density

85
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,880
with no impurities.

86
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,580
The essence of cold iron.

87
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,180
A piece of the real essence of cold iron.

88
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,080
It’s you again.

89
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,340
The core of cold iron.

90
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,010
No,

91
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,340
the essence of cold iron.

92
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,910
With this,

93
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,910
I can recreate

94
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,610
the unique hidden weapon of Tang Clan.

95
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,510
This is the hardest metal on the continent.

96
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,110
You can never find over five kilograms
in the whole Gengxin Town.

97
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,040
And this one is several hundreds of kilograms.

98
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,680
It’s extremely valuable.

99
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,440
It only took me one gold soul coin.

100
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,180
And that lath-like gold.

101
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,380
Got it also with one gold soul coin.

102
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,110
Miss Ning,

103
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,640
could you please tell me

104
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,480
how you found these minerals?

105
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,240
A soul master with the martial soul
of the Qibao Amber Pagoda

106
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,910
has a strong ability for treasure appraisal.

107
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,780
Rong Rong’s ability for treasure appraisal

108
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,540
is even better than Chief Ning.

109
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,540
These minerals she bought

110
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,010
were mixed in a pile of pure iron.

111
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,310
The boss didn’t even recognize it.

112
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,910
This.

113
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,740
And this.

114
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,110
This, this, and this.

115
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,410
Catch it.

116
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,790
The boss gave me this for free.

117
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,240
I think this stone

118
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,510
is the most valuable.

119
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,780
Could we be so lucky?

120
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,580
So tough.

121
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,940
If

122
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,810
the essence of cold iron is the hardest metal,

123
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,780
then this one

124
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,310
is the toughest.

125
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,210
The quality is even better than
the essence of cold iron.

126
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,180
I’ve never seen such unique metal like this.

127
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:09,880
Rong Rong,

128
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,880
You really got lucky this time.

129
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,510
If my guess is right,

130
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,510
this is the core of Deep Sea Silver.

131
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,940
If that’s so,

132
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,040
the Storm Pear Blossom Needle can...

133
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,810
I can’t say for sure.

134
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,510
It’s way too tough

135
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,480
that no fire can melt it.

136
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,180
It can only be hammered into shape.

137
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,810
Whether it’s you, me,

138
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:27,880
or even Master Lou Gao,

139
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,880
none of us can do that for now.

140
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:32,880
I’m afraid

141
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,680
my former master is the only one who can.

142
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,510
Peacock Plumes,

143
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,940
Storm Pear Blossom Needle,

144
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,280
and Tang’s Lotus of Buddha’s Rage.

145
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,880
Are we finally getting to meet again?

146
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,010
If we are able to make these three hidden weapons,

147
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,010
even if it’s the Martial Soul Hall...

148
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,840
Maybe, I do have a way.

149
00:06:59,010 --> 00:06:59,910
But

150
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,510
I have to deal with it later.

151
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,940
I envy you, Teacher.

152
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,640
I can’t imagine

153
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,240
what great pleasure it would be

154
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,710
to use supreme iron
when smithing as God of  Ironsmith.

155
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,710
The auction is about to begin.

156
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,910
Ladies and gentlemen,

157
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:11,680
please.

158
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:07,440
Kid,

159
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,680
that thing on the blueprint

160
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,810
can only be made by the hardest
and the toughest material, right?

161
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,240
Senior, you do have a good eye.

162
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,440
We’ve already got the right metal.

163
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,210
After getting back to Tang Clan,

164
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,910
we’re going to count on your incredible skills.

165
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,910
This might be

166
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:29,040
another path to raising
the social status of ironsmiths.

167
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,280
I must come up with some remarkable treasures

168
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,510
so that the people
of the Martial Soul Hall will know

169
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,780
ironsmiths

170
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,480
can reach the same level as theirs.

171
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,210
I believe you will make it.

172
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,810
All the distinguished guests, welcome!

173
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,980
I am Si Di,

174
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,440
one of Master Lou Gao’s disciples.

175
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,710
I am here to announce

176
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,710
today’s auction has begun.

177
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,740
This is the very first auction item for today.

178
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,580
A piece of black banded iron
with ninety percent purity

179
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,010
and 231 kilograms of weight.

180
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,480
Incredible.

181
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,280
Yes.

182
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,710
<i>Black-banded iron</i>

183
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,110
<i>is also called black iron.</i>

184
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,810
<i>Adding it into a metallic compound</i>

185
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,540
<i>can dramatically increase
the hard degree of other metals.</i>

186
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,980
<i>Such a large piece of black iron</i>

187
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,240
<i>with such high quality.</i>

188
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,610
<i>It’s the world’s most rare treasure.</i>

189
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,040
The reserve price is 20,000 gold soul coins.

190
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,240
The bid increment is 100 gold soul coins.

191
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,410
Now you may call out your bids.

192
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,840
Twenty-three thousand.

193
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,410
This bidder has offered 23,000 gold soul coins.

194
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:09,840
Any more bids?

195
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,740
Twenty-four thousand.

196
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,440
Twenty-five thousand.

197
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,240
Twenty-six thousand.

198
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,410
Twenty-seven thousand.

199
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,180
Thirty thousand.

200
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,240
Thirty thousand gold soul coins calling once.

201
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,380
Thirty thousand gold soul coins calling twice.

202
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,840
Forty thousand.

203
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,840
<i>This is...</i>

204
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,310
Forty thousand gold soul coins calling once.

205
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,240
Forty thousand gold soul coins calling twice.

206
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,840
Forty thousand gold soul coins, last calling.

207
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,110
Sold.

208
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:24,980
[Soul Land]

209
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,880
The next item for auction

210
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,510
is a piece of gold with extremely high purity,

211
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,540
weighing 50 kilograms,

212
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,540
which is also a treasure rarely seen.

213
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,280
Starting price,

214
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,280
ten thousand gold soul coins.

215
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,610
Thirty thousand.

216
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,310
Who is this?

217
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,140
Who’s offering such a high price?

218
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,140
Is he here to make trouble on purpose?

219
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,410
He’s a bishop of the Martial Soul Hall.

220
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,340
Myles.

221
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,510
No wonder he gives the highest price at will

222
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,340
because he won’t pay at all.

223
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,480
He will have these things on credit
under the name of the Martial Soul Hall

224
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,440
and delay payment
until the Ironsmiths Society compromises.

225
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,640
That jerk.

226
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,080
Senior, please stay calm.

227
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,940
Rong Rong.

228
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,440
We only bid for the rare metals
in the coming session.

229
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,440
But when Myles bids higher,

230
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,540
let him take it.

231
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,010
Sold.

232
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,980
Sold.

233
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,340
Sold.

234
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,140
Sold.

235
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,210
Sold.

236
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,210
Today’s auction items

237
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:10,080
have all gone into these two people’s pockets.

238
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,140
Coming up

239
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,880
are the last two items for today’s auction.

240
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:16,810
Their creator

241
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,310
is my teacher,

242
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,940
president of the Ironsmiths Society,

243
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,610
the God of  Ironsmith, Lou Gao.

244
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,240
The God of  Ironsmith, Lou Gao,
hasn’t made any new products for a long time.

245
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,510
These two items are indeed precious.

246
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,480
They are called

247
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,410
Peerless Flexible Armor.

248
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,310
They can withstand

249
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,910
the Sixth Soul Skill of a Storm Attack Soul Master.

250
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,780
Although made of metals,

251
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,810
they are extremely flexible.

252
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,210
The most amazing thing is

253
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,140
that they are created with
eight different kinds of metal

254
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,680
melted, with a special ratio,

255
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,440
into a special kind of

256
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,440
extendable memory metal.

257
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,440
For now,

258
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,410
only the God of Ironsmiths, Lou Gao, can refine it.

259
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,010
Flexible metal.

260
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,010
This is a miracle!

261
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,810
He has studied it for ten whole years

262
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,140
and repeatedly experimented
on many kinds of rare metal.

263
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,840
He finally succeeded.

264
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,440
Given this,

265
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,280
he is better than me.

266
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,510
I promise you with my life and soul

267
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,810
that they are absolutely divine artifacts.

268
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:28,940
Reserve price

269
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,380
two hundred thousand gold soul coins for one piece.

270
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,140
Now you can bid.

271
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,540
Such kind of powerful things,

272
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,910
I’ll save one to enhance my ability

273
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:43,380
and give the other to Her Holiness as a tribute.

274
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,240
I’ll have both of them. One million gold soul coins.

275
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,710
I believe

276
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,910
it will end the bidding for this lot.

277
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:58,380
Any more bids?

278
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,310
Alright.

279
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,940
One million gold soul coins.

280
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,080
Sold!

281
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,810
That’s all for today’s auction.

282
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,580
Please leave the venue.

283
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,480
That bidder

284
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,780
was Myles.

285
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,880
He said he would go back and raise money
before he left.

286
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,880
He’s not going to skip the payment, is he?

287
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,840
We didn’t drink enough, you know?

288
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,010
Have some more.

289
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:52,340
How dare you say that? You can’t drink.

290
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,680
I’ll fuddle you today.

291
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,610
Look.

292
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,230
Run!

293
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,010
It’s bad, Brother San!

294
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,610
I was monitoring as you told me to

295
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,610
and found that Myles was assembling his men

296
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,080
to slaughter the Ironsmiths society

297
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,040
for the treasures.

298
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,810
Darn it.

299
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:23,640
Does he want other great works of my teacher?

300
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,480
And we have refused to join them,

301
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,340
so they just...

302
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,640
No worries.

303
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,480
Old friend,

304
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,940
we won’t

305
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,640
let them take away your works.

306
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,380
Tai Tan,

307
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,380
I know how strong you are.

308
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,980
But you can only help me defend once,

309
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,610
not forever.

310
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,510
My lord,

311
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,710
will there be any trouble，

312
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,980
robbing the Ironsmiths Society?

313
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:58,040
Remember, we are under the divine Martial Soul Hall.

314
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,380
It’s their honor

315

to give us their things.

316
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,680
Since they refuse to join us,

317
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,580
I must teach them a lesson.
