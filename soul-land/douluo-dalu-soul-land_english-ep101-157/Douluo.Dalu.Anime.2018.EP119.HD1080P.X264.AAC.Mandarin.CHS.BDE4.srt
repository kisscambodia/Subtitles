that could tarnish my image.

165
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,130
I hope you understand.

166
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,900
Go and invite others.

167
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:39,090
I reckon that
those who are not from a noble family,

168
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,920
are disqualified to study in Moon Pavilion.

169
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,050
<i>Oh, no. If Little San’s heinous spirit
is out of control again...</i>

170
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,500
What are you smirking at?

171
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,410
Etiquette teaches me to be restrained,
while music calms me.

172
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,620
You should be
more self-disciplined and nobler than me

173
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,560
since you’ve studied longer.

174
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,200
But, it seems otherwise.

175
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:15,250
What does a commoner like you
know what nobility means?

176
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,840
Even a commoner like me knows that

177
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,480
nobility doesn’t engraved on your skin

178
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,980
nor run in your blood.

179
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,840
It’s a medal you earn with your behavior.

180
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,520
Lineage is not a must for a hero.
We’ve studied together for some time.

181
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,680
We know how excellent Tang Yin is.

182
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,960
Less than a year,

183
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,120
Tang Yin’s harp skill

184
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,120
has reached a superb level.

185
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,920
And his deportment,

186
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,410
his gallant manner is
so different from others.

187
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:47,800
I hope you remember
the base of etiquette is respect.

188
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,690
Let’s continue.

189
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,280
<i>Brother, can you attend my graduation ceremony?</i>

190
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,600
<i>Tang Yin, the person I told you before,</i>

191
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,360
<i>has replaced me
as the representative of the graduates.</i>

192
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,920
<i>But I’m not upset</i>

193
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,730
<i>because his talent will surely shock you as well.</i>

194
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,540
How charming you are

195
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:51,490
<i>to make my proud sister admire you?</i>

No wonder sister

207
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,120
praised him in front of me.

You’re doing great today.

Thank you, Aunt.
