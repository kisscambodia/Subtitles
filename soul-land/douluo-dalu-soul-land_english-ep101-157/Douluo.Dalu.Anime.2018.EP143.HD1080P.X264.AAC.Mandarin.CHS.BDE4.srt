From today on,

35
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,480
there is no more grudge

36
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,210
between you,

37
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,240
your father

38
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,840
and Tribe of Defense.

39
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,510
If both of our tribes team up,

40
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,540
who can defend

41
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,840
against us?

42
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,840
It is high-sounding,

43
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,280
but I’m afraid

44
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,010
that he’s planning
to take over the Tribe of Defense.

45
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,510
I would rather die in honor

46
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,310
than live in disgrace!

47
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,140
The mansion of the Tribe of Defense

48
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,540
is indestructible.

49
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:44,910

00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:57,810
Come!

54
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,810
Since we’re members of the same clan,

55
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,910
make yourself at home.

56
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,210
Let’s drink together!

57
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:03,540
Senior.

58
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,770
I really can’t drink much.

59
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,740
I’m afraid that I can only drink a bowl with you.

60
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,610
Alright!

61
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,840
I won’t force you.

62
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,310
I lost to you in the battle.

63
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,240
I can finally regain my dignity

64
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,470
in this banquet.

65
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,240
Both of you.

66
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,410
Why didn’t you wait for me

67
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,510
when you had good wine?

68
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:31,910
Old White Bird.

69
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,970
I didn’t expect that you would arrive early.

70
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,470
He’s the Chief of the Tribe of Agility,

71
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,270
Grandpa Bai He.

72
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,840
And she is his granddaughter, Bai Chen Xiang.

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,470
Old Rhino.

74
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,240
Old Gorilla.

75
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,510
You drank without me.

76
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,240
You have to punish yourselves
with three glasses of wine later.

77
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,240
Old White Bird.

78
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,840
Just tell us if you want to drink.

79
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,470
Don’t make excuses.

80
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,970
Hello, Grandpas.

81
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,770
Hello.

82
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,840
Xiang becomes prettier.

83
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:11,710
Come.

84
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,240
Let’s talk inside.

85
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,740
I saw Huyan Zhen

86
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,470
on my way here.

87
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,440
Old Rhino.

88
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,940
Did he come to look for you?

89
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,340
Huyan Zhen

90
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,710
came to persuade our tribe
on behalf of the Martial Soul Hall.

91
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,310
I rejected him.

92
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,540
But, I’m worried that they will take revenge.

93
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,640
So, I’ve decided

94
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,870
to move our tribe to Tian Dou City

95
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,370
and work with Old Gorilla.

96
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,140
Old White Bird.

97
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,710
We can’t help you in the future.

98
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,610
It’s been many years.

99
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,570
Had it not been for your help,

100
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,310
our Tribe of Agility

101
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,140
would have already ceased to exist.

102
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,440
It’s a shame.

103
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,070
Even now,

104
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,210
our tribe still...

105
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,240
Old White Bird.

106
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,310
Let me introduce a person to you.

107
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,710
My little brother

108
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,310
is a genius in the casting industry.

109
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,740
He created some weapons.

110
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:26,440
I think

111
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,370
they suit your tribe.

112
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,440
Never underestimate this thing.

113
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,310
It’s called the Godly Zhuge Crossbow.

114
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,470
Back then, Qibao Amber Tribe

115
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,670
managed to survive extermination,

116
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,370
thanks to a hundred of this kind of weapon.

117
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:41,810
Yes.

118
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,740
It’s very powerful.

119
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,270
It can destroy the defense soul skill

120
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,570
of a soul master who is below Level 40.

121
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,740
Really?

122
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,610
I’ve tried it.

123
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,170
He wasn’t exaggerating.

124
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:55,640
Grandpa Niu.

125
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:56,770
Was it the one

126
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,470
that penetrated your door?

127
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,110
You’re right.

128
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,570
So amazing?

129
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,770
What is its effective attack range?

130
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,110
Within 50 meters.

131
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,340
<i>It does suit our tribe.</i>

132
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,470
<i>It can make up for our disadvantage in attacking.</i>

133
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,510
Great.

134
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,340
I’ll buy this.

135
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,540
How much is it?

136
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:19,940
I want 200 of them.

137
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,940
Since you’re a friend of Senior Tai Tan,

138
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:23,940
I’ll take

139
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,610
120 gold soul coins then.

140
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:26,970
Alright.

141
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,420
There are 100 gold soul coins.

142
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,620
For the remaining 20 gold soul coins,

143
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,320
I’ll pay you
when the Tribe of Destruction arrives.

144
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,290
Senior.

145
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,720
I think that you’ve misunderstood me.

146
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,220
I meant

147
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,190
120 gold soul coins for one.

148
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,590
What did you say?

149
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,490
Are you fooling me?

150
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,120
Why don’t you rob someone?

151
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,120
Senior, please calm down.

152
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,660
We, Tang Clan, never cheat

153
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:53,960
when we do business.

154
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,590
I can guarantee

155
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,890
that this price is almost the same as the cost.

156
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,390
If you want,

157
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,460
you can buy one to protect yourself.

158
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,720
Though we failed to make a deal,
we can still maintain a good relationship.

159
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,890
I’ll give this Godly Zhuge Crossbow

160
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,890
to you to commemorate our first meeting.

161
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,020
This...

162
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,560
I can’t accept anything while doing nothing.

163
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,760
I can’t take it.

164
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,720
What about this?

165
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,060
I always look up to the Tribe of Agility

166
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:24,860
for your astonishing speed.

167
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:25,690
Why don’t I

168
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,590
have a battle with Miss Bai?

169
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:29,690
If I win,

170
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,490
I get these 100 gold soul coins.

171
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,260
If I lose,

172
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,220
I’ll pass this Godly Zhuge Crossbow

173
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,090
to you as the stake.

174
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,120
How is it?

175
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,020
You’re competing with our tribe in speed?

176
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,060
This...

177
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,020
Alright!

178
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:44,890
I’ll compete with you.

179
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,060
How shall we compete?

180
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:49,760
Within half an hour,

181
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,620
we’ll compete in this living room.

182
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,620
If you can touch any part of my body,

183
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,620
you win.

184
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,790
If not,

185
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,620
I win.

186
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,420
Alright.

187
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,620
Tribe of Agility,

188
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,290
Bai Chen Xiang.

189
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,490
Come on.

190
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,420
Tang Clan,

191
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,320
Tang San.

192
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,060
Tang Clan?

193
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,290
Old White Bird.

194
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,590
This young man

195
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,620
is not simple.

196
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,060
He founded Tang Clan

197
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,390
and is planning to fight the Martial Soul Hall.

198
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,790
Old Gorilla and I have already joined him.

199
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,760
Look.

200
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,490
Let me have a look at how good he is first.

201
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,160
I’ll start now.

202
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:26,590
Please.

203
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,260
<i>Ghostly Trace.</i>

204
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:38,610
<i>It was close.</i>

205
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,860
<i>Her speed is scarier than I imagined.</i>

206
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,820
<i>He actually managed to dodge.</i>

207
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,220
<i>His steps are agile and unpredictable.</i>

208
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,820
<i>No wonder he suggested this battle.</i>

209
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,090
<i>But,</i>

210
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,060
<i>your steps</i>

211
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,590
<i>are not enough.</i>

212
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,920
Her action

213
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,590
is so beautiful.

214
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,090
<i>Sharp-tailed Swift Soul Skill?</i>

215
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,460
<i>Sharp-tailed Swifts</i>

216
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,490
<i>are the fastest birds in flight.</i>

217
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,490
<i>No wonder I’ve heard that the Tribe of Agility</i>

218
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,020
<i>focuses fully on their agility
during their training.</i>

219
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,090
Xiang is using her Martial Soul.

220
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,660
Can the Chief win?

221
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,790
Look at Old White Bird’s face.

222
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,020
He was relaxed at first.

223
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,220
But he’s anxious now.

224
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,360
So,

225
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,860
what do you think?

226
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,960
<i>Why is it burning so fast?</i>

227
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,760
<i>Third Soul Skill, Flight.</i>

228
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:04,920
<i>It’s useless.</i>

229
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,790
<i>Purple Demon Eye restrains speed.</i>

230
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,320
<i>First Soul Skill, Delusion.</i>

231
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:13,420
<i>Delusion?</i>

232
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,090
<i>She even has such a soul skill?</i>

233
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,420
<i>This happens every time.</i>

234
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,960
<i>It looks like I’m going to touch him,</i>

235
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,220
<i>but he always dodges it as he has predicted it.</i>

236
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,660
<i>Didn’t expect that Brother San’s
Blue Silver Emperor Right Thighbone</i>

237
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,120
<i>not only contains the additional skill,</i>

238
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,360
<i>but also allows him to speed up.</i>

239
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,260
I’m not watching! I’m dizzy.

240
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,090
Brother San will win anyway.

241
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,690
<i>Tang San! You can’t escape this time!</i>

242
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:14,320
[Soul Land]

243
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,460
Time’s up!

244
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,190
You cheated!

245
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,020
How can half an hour be so short?

246
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,890
Even if you’re given another half an hour,

247
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,920
you still can’t touch a single strand
of Brother San’s hair.

248
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,820
The outcome will still be the same!

249
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,260
You...

250
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,160
He’s right.

251
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,220
We lost.

252
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,720
I admit defeat.

253
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,620
Miss Bai.

254
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,460
Thank you.

255
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,160
If you’re competent,

256
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,560
let’s compete in the long-distance speed.

257
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,290
Enough.

258
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,490
As he’s competing
with our Tribe of Agility in speed,

259
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,360
he may certainly choose the way to compete.

260
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,490
You didn’t train hard.

261
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,660
How dare you complain?

262
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,120
It’s not scary to fail.

263
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,790
But you have to realize the reason
of your failure.

264
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,290
Ouch!

265
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,590
It hurts!

266
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,290
This girl

267
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,290
has a temper.

268
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,990
Your steps are wonderful.

269
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,060
I’m convinced that we’ve lost.

270
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,860
I used my tricks.

271
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,060
Looking solely at the speed,

272
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,890
no one can compete with your tribe.

273
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,960
What’s the use of it?

274
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,620
Among the four single attribute tribes,

275
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:02,360
Tribe of Agility is the most useless one.

276
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,060
You just didn’t get a good chance
to showcase your skills.

277
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:07,960
Senior.

278
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,920
Why don’t we compete again?

279
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,490
If you lose,

280
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,860
I hope

281
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,220
that you can join Tang Clan.

282
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:14,960
Tang Clan

283
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,690
will provide you with all the equipment

284
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,560
and the resources you need.

285
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,190
And we won’t

286
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,760
give any orders to you.

287
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,360
What do you think?

288
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,660
Kid.

289
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,920
You’re very ambitious.

290
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,460
Chief.

291
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,820
I’m not judging you.

292
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,290
It’s okay for a young man to be confident.

293
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,690
But, if you’re too arrogant,

294
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,790
you’ll suffer.

295
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,620
No one can triumph

296
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,160
over Old White Bird’s speed.

297
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,290
If I lose,

298
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,190
I’m willing to provide you

299
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,820
with the full set of secret weapons for free,

300
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,490
including a Godly Zhuge Crossbow,

301
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,020
two sets of Soundless Arrow,

302
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,720
a Tight Flowery Crossbow,

303
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,060
a Malicious Attack,

304
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,020
and two Leg Crossbows.

305
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,160
Chief.

306
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,090
This set costs at least 500 gold soul coins.

307
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,660
There are more than 200 people
in the Tribe of Agility.

308
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,160
That would be 100,000.

309
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,560
Senior, what do you think?

310
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,290
Alright.

311
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,620
I’ll bet with you.

312
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,420
If I lose,

313
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,020
the Tribe of Agility will join Tang Clan.

314
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,120
But, I have to remind you first.

315
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,760
If Tang Clan is somehow related
to the Martial Soul Hall

316
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,890
later,

317
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,420
we’ll quit immediately.

318
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,760
There’s only one possibility
that Tang Clan is related

319
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,060
to the Martial Soul Hall,

320
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,190
which is the latter’s destruction.

321
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,360
Senior.

322
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,020
Let’s get started.

323
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,560
Still half an hour.

324
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,090
Same conditions.

325
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,490
This room is too narrow.

326
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,260
We shall go out and compete instead.

327
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,120
Alright. Please.

328
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:12,850
Get set!

329
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,290
<i>First soul bone skill of Soft Bone Rabbit.</i>

330
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,220
Go!

331
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:04,920
<i>It was close.</i>

332
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,590
<i>I can’t dodge him</i>

333
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,590
<i>just by Ghostly Trace.</i>

334
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,820
Teleport?

335
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,660
No wonder you were confident.

336
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,290
It’s interesting.

337
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,290
I want to see

338
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,520
how many times you can teleport.

339
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,490
Be careful!

340
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,290
<i>After my breakthrough in power,</i>

341
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,790
<i>the soul bone skill, Teleport,</i>

342
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,860
<i>is enhanced too.</i>

343
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,660

This is too fast.

Brother San only managed to dodge him

by changing his direction of teleport non-stop.

You didn’t spend much of your soul power
