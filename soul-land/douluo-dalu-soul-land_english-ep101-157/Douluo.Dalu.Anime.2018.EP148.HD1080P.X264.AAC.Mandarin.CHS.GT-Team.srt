This is the beauty of uniqueness.

165
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,850
This is taught by my master, Lou Gao,
the God of Ironsmith. You know nothing!

166
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,950
Lou Gao did once create
a Bright Silver Armor.

167
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:30,810
But, this is a lame fake.

168
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,050
Every plate of the Bright Silver Armor

169
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,750
that is created by Lou Gao

170
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,280
is made by refined pure silver.

171
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,610
The plates are thin,
but they protect the user well.

172
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,410
It is an accessory with good practicability.

173
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:50,750
Rubbish is already an understatement.

174
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,280
Oh, there’s a good show to watch now.

175
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,550
Liar!

176
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,350
This man is ruining
the reputation of ironsmiths.

177
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,010
Yes. He must be punished.

178
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,710
Don’t cheat around with his title next time.

179
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:17,780
Or else, you won’t survive here in Gengxin Town.

180
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,850
You...!

181
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:31,210

[Soul Land]

183
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,350
Who’s causing trouble here?

184
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,510
Brother-in-law, it’s him.

185
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,150
I was selling my latest products,

186
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,950
but this old man came and made a scene.

187
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,150
He not only criticized my new armor,

188
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,150
but also insulted the God of Ironsmith, Lou Gao.

189
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,550
Ouch!

190
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,030
Arrest him now!

191
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,630
No wonder he dared to
fool aound with Lou Gao’s title.

192
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,790
I see. Someone backs you up.

193
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,390
Take him!

194
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,230
Master Tai Tan.

195
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,230
It’s really you!

196
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,590
Welcome back. I am...

197
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,510
Si Long.

198
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,270
Good boy.

199
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,110
You’re getting stronger.

200
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,990
Master Si Long is bowing to him.

201
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,630
Is he one of the three Gods of Ironsmith?

202
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,830
I didn’t expect that

203
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,230
Senior Tai Tan is of such a high status

204
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,790
in the Capital of Metal.

205
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,710
Seems like I can’t stay low key.

206
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,350
Is the liar indeed Lou Gao’s disciple?

207
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,670
If I’m not wrong,

208
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,710
he was bribed by the Martial Soul Hall

209
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,670
to defame my teacher, Master Lou Gao.

210
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,350
Bishop Myles. This is the case.

211
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,550
How dare he cause trouble on the territory
of Main Hall of the Martial Soul Hall!

212
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,190
He’s asking for trouble.

213
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,430
Keep a close eye on them.

214
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,480
Yes.

215
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,790
Are you being suppressed
by the Martial Soul Hall too?

216
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,710
Not only that. They have gone too far!

217
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,230
You’ve suffered a lot in recent years.

218
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,270
Chief.

219
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,030
Let’s get in the carriage.

220
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,110
After meeting Lou Gao,

221
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,070
I’ll show you around Gengxin Town.

222
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,910
<i>Chief?</i>

223
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,190
<i>Even Master Tai Tan calls him that.
He must be an unusual man.</i>

224
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,190
<i>Is Master Tai Tan here</i>

225
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,310
<i>to accompany him to purchase things?</i>

226
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,430
Here we are.

227
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,030
Please come down.

228
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,830
This is the headquarter of
the Ironsmith Society?

229
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,630
It’s been a long while.
Nothing seems to have changed.

230
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,910
Let’s go.

231
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,830
Let’s meet our old friend.

232
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,030
There are five floors in the building.

233
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,870
The first floor is the trading area.

234
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,270
Relatively,

235
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,910
the goods sold in the headquarter
are more expensive than that out there,

236
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,950
but all the products are verified by the society.

237
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,030
They are guaranteed.

238
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,070
The second floor is the advanced trading area.

239
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,830
Whoever owns a shop here

240
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,310
is experienced and capable.

241
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,470
<i>The products being sold here</i>

242
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,270
<i>are more advanced than those</i>

243
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,270
<i>on the first floor.</i>

244
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,830
The third floor

245
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,710
is where ironsmiths register for an assessment.

246
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,630
The registration is routine.

247
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,150
Nothing is worth a visit.

248
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,670
The fourth floor is for
VIP customers and auctions.

249
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,510
We don’t have auctions in the daytime,
so it’s not open.

250
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,230
There’s one tomorrow night. It will be open then.

251
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,390
Alright.

252
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,310
We shall come again tomorrow night.

253
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,470
Chief.

254
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,670
We shall go straight to the fifth floor

255
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,910
to meet Lou Gao.

256
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,410
Okay.

257
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,790
Here it is. The fifth floor.

258
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,630
This is the office of the Ironsmith Society.

259
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,510
The fifth floor is a secret casting area
exclusively to the high-ranked ironsmiths.

260
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,670
Every ironsmith with the title of

261
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,910
the Grand Iron Master or higher
has their personal space here.

262
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,710
What is Lou Gao experimenting these days?

263
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,750

264
