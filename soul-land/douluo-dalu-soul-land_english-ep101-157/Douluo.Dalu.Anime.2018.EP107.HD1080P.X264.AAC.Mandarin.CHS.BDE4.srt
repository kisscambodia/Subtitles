[Next Episode]
Martial Soul Hall,

210
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,800
what you have owed me,

211
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,940
I want you to repay one day.

212
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,620
If Tang Hao didn’t present today,

213
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,370
perhaps none of us could leave here.

214
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,860
Let them leave.

215
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,070
Get out of Martial Soul Hall now.

216
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,580
I should lock you up

217
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,880
and kill you

218
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,120
when Tang San needs you.

219
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,720
You’re the first man to comb my hair

220
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,720
and the only one.

221
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,700
Forever.
