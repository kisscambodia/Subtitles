this is Slaughter City.

To show my sincerity,

70

I’ll tell you my origin.

I’m Hu Liena, from Martial Soul Hall.

72

My teacher

73

is the Pope of Martial Soul Hall.

I see, you’re the disciple of the Pope.

75

76

the conflicts between
Martial Soul Hall and Hao Tian Tribe.

I can reveal one more secret to you.

If one’s able to pass through Hell Road,

79
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,990
he’ll be recognised by one special domain,

80
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,960
namely, the Death God Domain.

81
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,030
It absorbs one’s heinous spirit
and tags on his own martial soul.

82
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,240
<i>Death God Domain?</i>

83
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,640
<i>Is this the reason why
Father asked me to come here for?</i>

84
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,810
Besides, it’ll enhance

85
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,520

one’s heinous spirit.

86

How are you so clear about it?

87
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:03,320

who possesses this domain.

The 100th match of Asura King
is beginning soon.

is above Level 80.

92

I can’t believe they’ll collaborate.

93
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,830
If they lose,

94
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:16,030
their soul power will belong to Asura King.

95
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:19,120
They have high possibility to win.
That guy had won 49 matched

96
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,590
just around one year plus.

97
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,720
His winning rating is just below
Asura King and Emissary of Hell.

While the others had won 40 matches.

to handle them.

let’s challenge the Hell Road together.

Quickly dodge!

Even Hao Tian Hammer can’t resist this,
Meteor Continuous Hammer.

116
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,680
Meteor Hammer, which is formed from
the condensation of soul power?

117

It entices people to consume
to boost their soul power.

You’re not deeply poisoned.
Stop before you get worse. Take this.

the Death God Domain.</i>

165
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,940
No need.

166
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,400
I’m willing to pass through
Hell Road on my own

167
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,590
to become Death God.

168
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:36,620
Perhaps you’re not aware of
the horror of Hell Road.

169
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,220
Emissary of Hell,

170
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,620
I hope you’d understand

171
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,830
you only have one life.

172
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,220
Mighty Slaughter King,

173
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,620
isn’t it funny for you
to talk about life with me?

174
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,230
How about you?

175
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,130
I appreciate your kind intention.

176
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:02,040
Please open the entrance of Hell Road.

177
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,450
I’ll pass through Hell Road
with Emissary of Hell.

178
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,650
Both of you are collaborating?

179
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,610
Have you forgotten your origin?

180
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,850
Rather than both of us die at Hell Road,

181
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,270
why don’t we go out of here alive

182
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,410
and become the real Death Gods?

183
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:21,450
Please follow Slaughter City’s rule,
Slaughter King.

184
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:28,110
If so, it will be a good journey

185
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,860
to have company at Hell Road.

186
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,040
No one has ever seen
the opening of Hell Road

187
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,600
besides Death God and Slaughter King...

188
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,190
They’d be honored to be the sacrifice

189
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,630
of the opening of Hell Road.

190
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,980
<i>Those who’ve seen it have...</i>

191
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,890
<i>What’s that?</i>

192
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:56,170
<i>Even my spirit power can’t endure it...</i>

193
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,790
Wish you good luck.

194
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,930
[Next Episode]
This is Hell Road?

195
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,120
I wonder what’s down there?

196
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,560
Do you feel it’s getting
hotter and hotter?

197
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,210
Those who collaborated
to challenge Hell Road

198
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,640
do have their own agendas.

199
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,140
When confronting with an invincible,

200
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,690
if you can’t let him surrender to you,

201
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,020
it’d be better to let him sleep forever.

202
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,200
Are you trying to harm me?

203
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,650
We’re in trouble now.

204
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,520
It’s too insidious.

205
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,790
Tang Yin!

206
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,430
Where’s the vital point?
