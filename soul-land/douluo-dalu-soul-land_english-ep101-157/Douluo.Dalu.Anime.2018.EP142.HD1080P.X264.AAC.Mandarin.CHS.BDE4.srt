<i>He’s doomed.</i>

<i>It’s impossible for you to defend my fist</i>

<i>What?</i>

53
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,330
He deserves to be the Chief,

54
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,860
as he knows how to

55
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,830
offset an attack behind him

56
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,060
by using forward power.

57
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,830
Brilliant.

58
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,330
Master San stands still at the moment.

59
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,760
But why does he still punch at the same place?

60
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:47,600
<i>No,</i>

61

67
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,960

use your Martial Soul right now!

That is the only way.

80
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,900
What happened?

81
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,530
There was an earthquake.

82
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:33,930
Kid,

83
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,100
you won.

84
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,060
I used my Martial Soul just now.

85
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,260
I lost.

86
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,130
No need to wait for half an hour.

87
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,860
My word counts.

88
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,430
From now on,

89
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,030
we, the Tribe of Defense,

90
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,960
will no longer

91
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,330

92
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,660
you and your father.

93
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,130
If you hadn’t been careless,

94
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,400
I wouldn’t have had the chance

95
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,630
to gather my strength, Senior.

96
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,300
Alright.

97
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,300
I did lose.

98
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,960
Am I such a person

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,630
that wouldn’t admit defeat?

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,600
You can stay.

101
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,330
I think you are indeed such a person.

102
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,160
You lost to this young man

103
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,330
at your strongest point, defensing.

104
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,730
You owe him some sort of a gesture.

105
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,460
What do you want?

106
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,960
Do you want me to

107
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,160
surrender to him with my tribe?

108
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,760
Not necessary.

109
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:18,860
But,

110
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,260
recently, Chief and I are about to

111
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,960
establish a clan named Tang Clan.

112
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,800
Are you in?

113
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,360
Knock it off.

114
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,460
Have you not had enough for Hao Tian Tribe?

115
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,760
Are we gonna suffer again?

116
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,530
Old Rhino,

117
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,760
I know what you are concerned about.

118
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,700
But, do you know

119
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,560
why I am in?

120
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,760
Why?

121
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,260
What I value

122
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,030
is his strength.

123
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,030
Did you know

124
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,600
the Soul Master Contest five years ago?

125
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,400
Of course I did.

126
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,130
Some boys from my tribe

127
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,500
joined the competition as well.

128
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,560
But they didn’t do well.

129
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,600
You are not as good as me in this field.

130
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,430
Tai Long is one of the members

131
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,430
of the champion team.

132
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,360
Great.

133
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:18,930
Boy,

134
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,830
you did a good job.

135
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,900
I heard that

136
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,330
the contest

137
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,330
is the most classic one

138
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,960
over the past few decades.

139
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,830
I am only a substitute.

140
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,860
I wasn’t even on the court

141
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,030
for the last match.

142
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,530
We defeated the Golden Generation

143
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,830
of Martial Soul Hall

144
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,100
thanks to Master San.

145
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,030
I was also one of the main players.

146
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:39,730
Tai Long,

147
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,700
why don’t you praise me?

148
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:43,330
Yes.

149
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,660
Fatty was also one of the main players.

150
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,600
He is much powerful than me.

151
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:05,960
Let’s go.

152
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,160
Now you get what I mean, right?

153
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,130
People from Martial Soul Hall

154
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,030
are also jealous of him.

155
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,700
He has a bright future.

156
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,230
But

157
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,400
I am afraid that

158
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,360
the whole world of soul masters will be reshuffled

159
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,030
in the near future.

160
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,100

Heavenly Elephant,

170
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,360
to what do I owe this pleasure?

171
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,000
I can see this dude is so strong.

172
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,730
Who is he?

173
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,130
He is my brother,

00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,630

175
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,160
So he is from the Tribe of Strength,

176
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,300
Brother Tai Tan.

177
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,900
Perfect timing.

178
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,560
- Saved my trip to Tian Dou City.
- Do you see that he comes with a lot of people?

179
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,600
<i>He’s here with so many skillful men.</i>

180
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,360
<i>Is he...</i>

181
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,500
Just cut to the chase.

182
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,200
Okay.

183
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,530
Brother Niu,

184
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,960
you may have received
a letter from the Martial Soul Hall.

185
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,400
I am sure

186
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,430
you know the Upper Three exist

187
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,830
in name only nowadays.

188
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,060
The Martial Soul Hall has enacted a law.

189
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,330
A year later,

190
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,300
they will re-select the Seven Great Tribes.

191
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,160
What’s that got to do with us?

192
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,930
To be honest,

193
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,100
I want to be elected as

194
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,330
one of the Upper Three.

195
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:05,460
Well,

196
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,260
that’s why I’m here today.

197
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,760
I hope that you can support me.

198
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:10,560
What?

199
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:42,460
[Soul Land]

200
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,360
We can unite to work on it.

201
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,660
No one can

202
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,830
defend us.

203
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,430
As long as you agree,

204
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,160
then you will be the Deputy Chief

205
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,960
of Elephant Armoured Tribe.

206
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,360
What do you think?

207
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,300
<i>Does he mean they can unite?</i>

208
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,860
<i>It sounds like a nice deal,</i>

209
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,000
<i>but actually,</i>

210
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,560
<i>the Tribe of Defense will be annexed by him.</i>

211
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,660
Don’t you forget

212
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,560
who pushed us

213
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,930
like homeless dogs.

214
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,460
Brother,

215
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,630
don’t you even understand

216
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,500
the strength of Martial Soul Hall?

217
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,760
You can ask for anything you want.

218
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,260
They can satisfy you,

219
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,930
even if I can’t.

220
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,630
Huyan Zhen.

221
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,900
You are free to be their running dog.

222
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,900
I’m not interested.

223
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,600
Niu Gao.

224
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,900
I called you Brother

225
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,260
because I was trying to be nice.

226
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,300
Qibao Amber Tribe

227
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,200
and Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Tribe
have come to a bad end.

228
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,330
Didn’t you see that?

229
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,530
Hao Tian Tribe did let us down,

230
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,800
but we, the Four Tribes,

231
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,600
have developed

232
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,300
relying on its power.

233
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,730
It is better to die with honor

234
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,360
than to live in infamy.

235
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,630
Kill me

236
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,700
if you can.

237
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,830
So,

238
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:11,660
I paid you respect but you rejected it.

239
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,100
Huyan Zhen.

240
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,730
I’d recommend you to call more people here

241
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:15,260
if you want to fight with me.

242
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,630
<i>It’s enough for me to</i>

243
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,760
<i>fight with you and your tribe,</i>

244
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,600
<i>but the God of Strength, Tai Tan, is here too.</i>

245
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,630
Okay.

246
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:28,930
Niu Gao.

247
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:30,930
I’ll see you soon.

248
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,960
I hope you will be as brave as you are today

249
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,060
when we meet again.

250
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,560
The bastards of Martial Soul Hall.

251
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,200
What do they want?

252
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,060
They are intimating you.

253
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,430
Not many people

254
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,860
like Senior Niu

255
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,160
are not afraid of them.

256
00:13:59,230 --> 00:13:59,800
A year later,

257
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:01,900
as long as the Seven Tribes Re-selection Contest

258
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,860
are successfully held,

259
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,000
the new Seven Tribes

260
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,060
will be controlled by them.

261
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,330
<i>He can see through.</i>

262
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:12,600
I think

263
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,530
the Martial Soul Hall

264
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:16,930
will fight against

265
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,500
the two empires openly

266
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,860
when that contest is over.

267
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:20,900
What’s worse,

268
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,730
once the war begins,

269
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,030
that will be disadvantageous

270
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,960
for the two empires.

271
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,560
Old Gorilla introduced

272
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,300
your awesome weapon to me

273
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,900
in private.

274
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,360
Godly Zhuge Crossbow.

275
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,230
May I have a look?

276
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,200
Is this it?

277
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,730
How could it be a deterrent to them?

278
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,300
Wanna show me?

279
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,060
No problem.

280
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,530
My house

281
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,830
is indestructible.

282
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:58,900
Feel free to try.

283
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:17,760
This...

284
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,260
My house...

285
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,300
Old Rhino.

286
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,100
You didn’t expect that, right?

287
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,500
Don’t underestimate it.

288
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,760
In the attack,

289
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,060
Qibao Amber Tribe managed to survive

290
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,460
thanks to hundreds of hidden weapons like this one.

291
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,660
That battle...

292
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,360
Indeed, this is remarkable.

293
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:42,960
If we can mass-produce it

294
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,000
for war,

295
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,030
we may stand a chance to fight

296
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,600
with the Martial Soul Hall.

297
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,830
Senior Niu Gao,

298
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,300
I sincerely invite you

299
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,230
to join Tang Clan.

300
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,130
I know you still can’t forget

301
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,360
Hao Tian Tribe once abandoned you,

302
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,530
but I can guarantee you

303
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:01,630
Tang Clan

304
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,200
will never be taken over by Hao Tian Tribe.

305
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,300
<i>It’s the right timing</i>

306
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,500
<i>for Chief to persuade him to join us.</i>

307
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,300
<i>Huyan Zhen violated</i>

308
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,900
<i>Old Rhino’s bottom line.</i>

309
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,960
<i>As a tribe chief,</i>

310
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,960
<i>he cares about his tribe’s life and death.</i>

311
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,700
In the past few years,

312
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,930
we are separated into two different empires.

313
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,000
I miss the days

314
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,260
when we dined together every day.

315
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,730
Old Rhino,

316
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,960
would you make a bet

317
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,760
with me this time?

318
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,330
They are going too far.

319
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,060
Alright.

320
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,230
Old Gorilla,

321
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,800
I’m in.

322
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,730
Tang San.

323
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,130
Don’t forget what you said today.

324
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,460
My brother,

325
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,730
welcome on board.

326
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,400
Senior Niu,

327
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,830
welcome on board.

328
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:00,560
Let’s go.

329
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,530
Let’s go for a drink

330
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,560
and have fun.

331
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,100
Let’s go.

332
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,800
Let’s drink all night

333
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:08,099
like we used to.

334
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,060
Speaking of the past,

335
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,700
it would be better

336
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:17,999
if Old White Bird and Old Goat are here with us.

337
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:19,900
Let’s drink

338
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:22,399
for three days.

339
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:24,729
Now that Tang Clan is so promising,

340
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,200
how about inviting Old White Bird?

341
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,960
He has a difficult time

342
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,500
with his Tribe of Agility.

343
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:35,060
That guy hates to be called that.

344
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,700
Don’t get him mad.

345
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,260
But

346
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,800
