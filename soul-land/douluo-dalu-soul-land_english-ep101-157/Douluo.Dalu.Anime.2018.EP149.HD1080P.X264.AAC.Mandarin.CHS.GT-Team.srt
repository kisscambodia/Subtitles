47
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,980
Let me show you this.

48
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,310
<i>It’s a casting furnace made solely of Black Iron.</i>

49
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,910
You’ve never seen this, right?

50
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,380
I spent a huge amount of money

51
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,310
to get this from the Martial Soul Hall.

52
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,310
Ironsmiths might get a higher status

53
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,650
because of it.

54
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,350
But when I was disassembling it,

55
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,510
I accidentally broke some of its components.

56
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,450
The man who made this

57
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,210
is definitely a genius!

58
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,680
Tai Tan, are you overwhelmed by this?

59
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,150
Why aren’t you talking?

60
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,150
<i>The thing on these blueprints</i>

61
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,180
<i>looks so similar to the Godly Zhuge Crossbow.</i>

62
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,350
<i>Is it...?</i>

63
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,580
<i>He’s indeed the God of Ironsmith in this world.</i>

64
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,780
Senior Lou Gao.
This is called the Godly Zhuge Crossbow.

65
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,450
I think the genius you just mentioned

66
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,380
is me.

67
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,910
Where did you come from, boy?

68
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,950
What did you say?

69
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,050
You...

70
00:04:06,697 --> 00:04:07,520
Well...

71
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,150
This is great!

72
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,550
Senior Lou Gao! What are you doing?

73
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,050
Brat! Why are you avoiding me?

74
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,210
Come here!

75
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:53,580
Come on!

76
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,980
Tell me how to fix it!

77
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,480
And...

78
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,510
how did you invent it?

79
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,710
<i>I sold this Godly Zhuge Crossbow</i>

80
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,180
<i>to the Qibao Amber Tribe.</i>

81
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,350
<i>Seems like the Martial Soul Hall
snatched many</i>

82
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,610
<i>Godly Zhuge Crossbows when they attacked
the Qibao Amber Tribe.</i>

83
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,710
I purposely made a system in

84
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,350
the Godly Zhuge Crossbow
to prevent disassembly.

85
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,150
Once a person disassembles it,

86
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,050
some gear will be triggered

87
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,250
to destroy the key components.

88
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,050
This is to prevent others from copying it.

89
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,550
I saw your blueprint.

90
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,880
Although it’s very close to
the actual design,

91
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,110
without the key part,

92
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,710
it’s useless.

93
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,180
Then, how can I fix it?

94
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:38,880
Senior.

95
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,750
I’m sorry to disappoint you.

96
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,910
I can’t help you.

97
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:42,810
What?

98
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,810
You! Brat!

99
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,250
You’re Tai Tan’s disciple, right?

100
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,280
I’m the President of the Ironsmith Society.

101
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,680
Senior, you’re the God of Ironsmith.

102
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,380
If I fix the Godly Zhuge Crossbow
in front of you,

103
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:01,110
you can definitely figure out how it works.

104
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,080
This is a secret of Tang Clan.

105
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,980
What is Tang Clan?

106
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,580
Brat! You’re very arrogant!

107
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,350
Tai Tan, why aren’t you stopping him?

108
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,050
There’s nothing I can do.

109
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,780
This is not my disciple

110
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,950
but the Chief of our clan.

111
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,480
I’ve joined Tang Clan.

112
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,480
Tai Tan.

113
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,810
Even if you can’t be the leader of
the Tribe of Strength,

114
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,810
you can return to the Ironsmith Society.

115
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:31,680
Old Brother.

116
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,780
Actually... If you were me,

117
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,980
you would join Tang Clan, too.

118
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,710
Although this Godly Zhuge Crossbow is not bad,

119
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,450
it’s just a normal

120
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,110
hidden weapon in Tang Clan.

121
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,350
Oh, right!

122
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,680
We call these things “hidden weapons”.

123
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,510
Besides our key members,

124
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,850
we will never reveal our secrets to anyone else.

125
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,150
This...

126
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,680
It’s easy. I’ll join Tang Clan.

127
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,510
Given my casting skills,

128
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,850
I can be a key member, right?

129
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,180
Si Long!

130
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,180
Get over here!

131
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,610
Teacher.

132
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,680
From now onwards,

133
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,750
you

134
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,950
are the President of the Ironsmith Society.

135
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,280
Teacher, are you joking?

136
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,910
Do I look like I’m joking?

137
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,510
I’ll leave my works

138
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,680
to you and your brothers.

139
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,450
When I’m not around at the Ironsmith Society,

140
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,910
you should be united.

141
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,910
If you’re faced with problems that you can’t solve,

142
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,210
send a man to the Tribe of Strength
to look for Tai Tan.

143
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,850
I think this is
the simplest handover ceremony in history.

144
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,550
Lou Gao.

145
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,950
Are you serious?

146
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,110
One will never succeed without taking a risk.

147
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,310
I must join Tang Clan!

148
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:07,750
Brat!

149
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,410
Do you dare to accept me?

150
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:09,780
Yes.

151
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:11,210
Of course.

152
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,210
Since you’re willing to join Tang Clan,

153
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,450
from now onward, you’ll be the same as Senior Tai Tan,

154
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,150
an Elder of Tang Clan.

155
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,150
Then, may I know

156
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,380
the method of making
this Godly Zhuge Crossbow?

157
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,450
Don’t worry.

158
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,180
I will never tell an outsider.

159
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,210
<i>I won’t reveal it when I’m in Tang Clan.</i>

160
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:36,350
<i>After I master the skill,
can’t I withdraw from Tang Clan?</i>

161
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,380
Godly Zhuge Crossbow

162
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,810
is no match for you, Senior.

163
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,310
With your status, you should work on

164
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:49,110
the best hidden weapon of our clan instead.

165
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,280
You have a even better hidden weapon?

166
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,880
Once we succeed in making it,

167
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,880
you’ll be the founder.

168
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,280
We will craft your name
on these peerless hidden weapons.

169
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,050

174

I’ll leave other things to you.

175
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,080
Yes, Teacher.

176
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,280
Senior.

177
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,010
We’ll go and buy some things first.

178

Go!

179
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,280
Getting Lou Gao into our clan

180
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,280
is a great help.

181
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,280
Although Senior Lou Gao is cunning,

182
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,480
he might be a great contributor to Tang Clan.

183
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,180
The Storm Pear Blossom Needle,

184
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,810
the Peacock Plumes and
the Tang’s Lotus of Buddha’s Rage.

185
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,580
We might be able to see them again.

186
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,810
I’ll treat you to lunch first.

187
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,450
We’ll shop for the metal later. What do you think?

188
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,250
You know us well.

189
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,050
I have a list here.

190
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,050
I’ll leave this errand to you.

191
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,410
Vice President Tai Tan.

192
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,980
Are you serious?

193
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,110
Ten tons of iron ore.

194
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,650
Five tons of pure silver.

195
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,080
Five tons of tungsten.

196
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,550
I never see anyone

197
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,350

198
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,510

199

203
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,010
Yes.

204

May I take you to another room?

208
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,230
I have important guests today.

209

211

But what?

212
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,990
But we’ve reserved the room.

213
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:36,990
He...

214

can’t afford to offend us.

215
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,950
Grand Master Si Long.

216
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,790
You know it too.

217
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,550
Myles is the Bishop of the Martial Soul Hall.

218
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,190
He’s the local despot.

219
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,670
We can’t offend him.

220
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,990
Why is he here?

221
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,190
I heard that he never gets along
with the Ironsmiths Society.

222
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,110
Is he here to pick a fight again?

223
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,430
Lower your voice!

224
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,790
It’s Bishop Myles.

225
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,190
Grand Master Si Long.

226
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,830
Do you want me to offer you our room?

227
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,990
What do you mean?

228
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,470
I pity you, being at Level 70,

229
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,430
but you’re just a useless tool soul master.

230

Si Long.

231
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,950
As long as you can persuade Lou Gao

232
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,310
to merge the Ironsmiths Society
with the Martial Soul Hall,

233
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,790
I’ll offer you my room.

234
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,750
Myles.

235
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,030
Next door is the headquarter of the Ironsmiths Society.

236
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,150
You should choose the right time
to make your statement!

237
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,750
So what?

238
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,470

Please come in.

255
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,190
They have the Elder Token of
the Martial Soul Hall.

256
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,990
Who are those people?

257
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,710
Please.

258
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,310
You people are from the Martial Soul Hall?

259
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,310
Don’t worry.

260
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,990
We are definitely the enemies of
the Martial Soul Hall.

261
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,870
The Elder Token...

262
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,590
My teacher got this in a coincidence.

263
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:23,870
Before we left,

264
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,550
he handed the token to me specifically.

265
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,830
So we can travel around this continent
without being bothered.

266
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,390
We should have chased them

267
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,030
and give those bastards a lesson!

268
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,510
If you punish them,

269
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,550
the Martial Soul Hall will blame it
on the Ironsmiths Society.

270
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,910
By then,

271
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,480
the Society will be in big trouble.

272

Senior Si Long.

273
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,510
The relationship between the Ironsmiths Society
and the Martial Soul Hall

274
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,710
looks very bad.

275
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,310
The Ironsmiths Society has little value

276
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,350
to the Martial Soul Hall.

277
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,790
We’re useless to them,
but they are not willing to let us go.

wants to take over the Ironsmiths Society
to earn himself some extra money.

280
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,390
He always sends people here to make trouble.

281
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,790

in Gengxin Town?

283
