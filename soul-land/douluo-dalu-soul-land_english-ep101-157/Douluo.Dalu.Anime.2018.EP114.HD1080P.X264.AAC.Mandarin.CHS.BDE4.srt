Participate in 100 matches,
you’ll be the champion.

55

But, the current top one

merely took part in 67 matches.

57

Every match you win

58

Well, your life’s in your own hands.

68
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,540
Hao Tian Hammer?
He is from Hao Tian Tribe.

69
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,520
That’s why he’s similar to Tang San.

70
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,880
Over the past thousand years,

71
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,550
you’re the third from Hao Tian Tribe

You’re too naive. In Slaughter City,

from Slaughter Arena.

he crushed them in the end.

All techniques of Asura King
are extremely powerful.

Even the Grand Soul Land Master

147
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,790
can’t kill him without using soul skill.

148
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:14,800
Do you think he can
hit 100 matches and challenge Hell Road?

149
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,440
It’s a matter of time
to hit 100 matches,

150
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,590
but, as for Hell Road,
I’m afraid he can’t.

151
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,430
I was told that

152
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:28,040
he was sent by the most terrifying one
of the two existing Death Gods.

153
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,920
While the Emissary of Hell
was sent by the other one.

154
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,800
Each time a Death God appears,

155
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,650
there would be disastrous harm
to Slaughter City.

156
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,960
Just in case,

157
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,600
why don’t we let
Emissary of Hell to battle Asura King?

158
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,450
They will be...

159
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,560
Fool.

160
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,400
We can’t afford to offend
any of the Death Gods.

161
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,490
Go, keep an eye on them.

162
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,350
Emissary of Hell has completed
the 99th match.

163
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,480
She just came here for around two years.

164
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,480
Asura King only came for a year.

165
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,910
He has won more than 90 matches.

166
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,960
What if both of them meet in the match...

167
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,600
Are you new?
Slaughter Arena stipulates that

168
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,290
participant with 50 victories and above
won’t meet in the match.

169
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,880
<i>As expected,
if winner absorb all soul power,</i>

170
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,340
<i>his or her strength should be
increased by leaps and bounds.</i>

171
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,040
<i>In every competition,</i>

172
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,600
<i>it may seem like the winner absorbs
all the soul power of losers,</i>

173
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,370
<i>in actual fact, it was all absorbed
by Slaughter Arena.</i>

174
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,370
<i>If I’m not wrong,</i>

175
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:31,020
<i>the entrance of Hell Road is
in the Hell Slaughter Arena.</i>

176
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,310
Netherlands shot is a good thing.

177
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,380
It calms our thoughts and
enhances our soul power too.

178
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,560
But it’s exorbitant.

179
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,880
It can only be exchanged with
the victory of Slaughter Arena.

180
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,110
Asura King!

181
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:35,310
I’m sure Emissary of Hell and
Asura King won’t worry about this.

182
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:38,350
It seems like Asura King
has completed 99 matches.

183
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,290
Perhaps Emissary of Hell wants
to challenge Hell Road with him,

184
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:45,950
that’s why she doesn’t
go for the last match.

185
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,930
She has finally got him.

186
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:56,080
He’s the first one
to achieve 99 wins in two years.

187
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,860
[Next Episode]
It’s me.

188
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,570
You’re here for training,

189
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,790
right?

190
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,690
I know you’re from Hao Tian Tribe.

191
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,320
To show my sincerity,

192
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,480
I’ll tell you about my origin.

193
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,360
When one passed through Hell Road,

194
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,670
he or she will be recognised
by a domain.

195
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,120
Absorb others’ heinous spirit.

196
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:21,760
Besides, everyone I met...

197
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,790
Talking about life with me,

198
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,890
isn’t this ironic?

199
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,170
My mighty Slaughter King.
