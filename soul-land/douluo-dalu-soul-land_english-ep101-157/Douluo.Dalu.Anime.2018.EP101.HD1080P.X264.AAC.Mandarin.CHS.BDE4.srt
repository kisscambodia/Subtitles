This individual match is
as important as the grand final.

If the team wins, they’ll become the top two

Martial Soul Hall is undoubtedly
the most advantageous.

Three Soul Kings

57
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,540
indicate the vast gap of
three Decade Millennium Soul Rings.

58

Plus their Martial Soul Fusion Skill.

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,250
They’ve defeated

60
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,410
Tian Dou Imperial School with merely one stroke.

61
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,630
No one could see what happened in the red mist,

62
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,910
not to mention figure it out.

63
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,100
The only goal of their strategy is

64
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,440
to terrorize.

65
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,460
<i>I had asked Yu Tian Heng.</i>

66
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,760

<i>of what skill was used.</i>

68
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,580
<i>They didn’t even exert their real strength then.</i>

69
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,380
This was the most intimidating strength
of Martial Soul Hall School.

70
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,580
With tyrannical abilities
and rigorous plannings,

71
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,100
they defeated their rivals

72
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,130
by gradually suppressing them.

73
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,630
Even their rivals are at Soul King level,

74
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,760
they’re still a formidable team to fight against.

75

Not to mention Shen Feng School and us.

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,380
None of us is under the Soul King level.

77

Rigorous planning is also our weapon.

78
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,020

In the first round,

82

we have to probe and observe
the other two teams’ strategies.

83

Give up?

93

Isn’t Martial Soul Hall School Team
the potential champion?

94
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,740
Why did they abstain in the first round?

Please state your reason.

101
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,300
My reason is

102
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,880
Shrek School renounces the individual match

103
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,420
and voluntarily enters the match for loser teams.

104
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,520
Jing Ling, come back.

105
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,960
Why?

106
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,310
I think we have the right to renounce.

107
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:53,460
Well, this is your right.

108
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,190
Sorry for asking.

109
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,620
My apologies, Elder Yu.

110
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,350
Elder?

111
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,560
<i>He’s the Elder of Martial Soul Hall?</i>

112
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,670
<i>I heard that even the two Grand Soul Land Masters</i>

113
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,420
<i>have outstanding credentials and achievements,</i>

114
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,980
<i>only then they’ve become the Elders these ten years.</i>

115
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,820
<i>With Grandmaster’s age and strength,</i>

116
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,090
<i>how would he have that kind of authority?</i>

117
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,000
<i>Why did she protect me?</i>

118
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,780
Continue.

119
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,750
Martial Soul Hall School Team is a formidable team.

120
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,990
We’re not their match.

121
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,900
We renounce this match

122
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,850
and fight with Shrek School
for the grand final’s quota.

123
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,070
If that’s the case,

124
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:54,170
Martial Soul Hall School Team will
directly enter tomorrow’s grand final.

125
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:58,200
Match between Shen Feng and Shrek
will be conducted in the afternoon.

126
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:03,740
I hope you’ll be prepared
for your match. Go back now.

127
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,220
Martial Soul Hall would play dirty tricks

128
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,340
at such a dominant position.

129
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,730
Jing Ling’s draw was lucky,

130
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,380
allowing us to observe our rivals.

131
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,820
But Martial Soul Hall School Team
suddenly conceded.

132
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,900
This has led to two results.

133
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,870
First, members of Martial Soul Hall
would keep their full strength intact.

134
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,960
Second, Huo Wu Shuang would keep
his full force to fight Jing Ling.

135
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,880
If he defeated Jing Ling,

136
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,020
he’d definitely concede
when confronting with Martial Soul Hall.

137
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,320
This means that the two schools

138
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,870
have allied to deal with us.

139
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,800
We can’t win in the individual match.

140
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,270
It’s fine if we lose.

141
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,570
But if we win,

142
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,970
we would have to suffer
in the continuous battle with them.

143
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,140
Isn’t this too wicked?

144
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,760
I didn’t get it

145
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,770
why Martial Soul Hall agreed on
the merger of Shen Feng and Chi Huo.

146
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:04,650
Now it turns out this is what they’ve planned.

147
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:08,580
Do they really think they can hinder us?

148
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,850
Aren’t they too arrogant?

149
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,280
We have only one goal.

150
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,170
Shrek must win!

151
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,140
Do you know why we did this?

152
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,140
I want a showdown between us.

153
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,770
I’d rather give up the championship
so as to beat you.

154
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,560
If this is what you want,

155
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,060
you’ve already fallen behind.

Time will tell.

157
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,480
Don’t think that I’ll give in to you

158
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,740
even though you saved me.

159
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,630
I’ve paid you what I owed.

[Soul Land]

Feng Xiao Tian and Tang San

163
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,370
represented their team to duel one-on-one.

00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:23,660
How will Tang San deal with them this time?

168
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,380
Shen Feng School stands in three rows.

169
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,620
It’s a firm formation for attacking and defending.

170
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,820
While Shrek School stands in one line.

171
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,600
Are they going to launch a surprise attack?

172
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,040
Shrek’s formation is totally
different from before.

173
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,150
Do they have other tricks behind?

174
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,230
Both teams are from Tian Dou Empire division.

175
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:41,980
[Tian Dou Empire]

176
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,500
They fought several times
in the preliminary and qualifying rounds.

177
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,390
Both teams won and lost to each other.
They’re well-matched in strength.

178
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:52,470
But only one team can enter the grand final.

179
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,690
Who will be the winner then?

180
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,630
I hereby announce

181
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,530
Shrek School versus Shen Feng School.

182
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,850
Start!

183
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,480
What are they doing?

184
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,600
What a terrifying soul power.

185
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,900
We’ll get hurt if we come close.

186
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,900
Follow the plan. Feng Xiao Tian, lift-off.

187
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,360
Sure.

188
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,630
Second Soul Skill, Double Wolves Shield Body.

189
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:59,460
Third Soul Skill, Gale Wings.

190
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,540
Third Soul Skill, Raining Sparks.

191
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,940
With Huo Wu’s Rings Fusion Skill

192
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,230
and the help of two
soul masters of Support Branch,

193
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,260
It seems that they pin all hopes

194
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,540
on Feng Xiao Tian and Huo Wu.

195
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,700
Have they managed to learn to fuse

196
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,300
their martial souls in such a short time?

197
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,920
Double Fusion Skill.

198
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,180
Cooperation of Huo Wu and Feng Xiao Tian

199
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,060
has greatly enhanced the strength of Shen Feng.

200
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,460
Power of fire and wind compliments each other.

201
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,130
It seems like Double Skills Fusion,

202
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:46,920
but they only focus their power on Feng Xiao Tian

203
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,820
empowering him in attacking and defending,

204
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,060
and to boost his power beyond a limit.

205
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:55,780
<i>But, our kids aren’t easy to deal with.</i>

206
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,200
Change.

207
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,080
I didn’t know that Rong Rong knows
Rings Fusion Skill.

208
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,090
She is the daughter of
Qibao Amber Tribe’s chief anyhow.

209
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:25,720
This skill exhausts
their soul power excessively,

210
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,590
so it’ll not be used casually.

211
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,610
<i>This is Seven in One Martial Soul Fusion Skill?</i>

212
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,550
Seven in one?

213
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,250
Generally speaking,

214
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,060
only soul masters with similar
martial souls and soul skills

215
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,340
are able to use this fusion skill.

216
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,300
Just like what Cang Hui School did previously.

217
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,560
But Shrek Seven Devils...

218
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,360
Each of them possesses
different martial souls and abilities.

219
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,930
But they still make it.

220
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,560
Although both are fusion skills,

221
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,590
however, this is much more difficult.

222
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,700
Is this the real strength of Grandmaster?

223
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,100
<i>I’ve tried to learn about the theory of</i>

224
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,690
<i>different martial souls fusion skill
proposed by Grandmaster,</i>

225
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,240
<i>but I can’t figure out how it works.</i>

226
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,160
<i>Perhaps only Tang San can see through it,</i>

227
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,420
<i>besides Grandmaster in this world.</i>

228
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,530
<i>It’s Seven in One Martial Soul Fusion Skill...</i>

229
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:48,660
<i>But I’ve found the weakness of it.</i>

230
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,700
<i>The initiator of this fusion skill
is Ning Rong Rong.</i>

231
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,300
<i>While the foundation of this skill</i>

232
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,500
<i>is Oscar who provides substantial
soul power to Ning Rong Rong.</i>

233
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:01,850
Hao Tian Hammer.

234
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,000
<i>The time when it shocked
the entire continent was the battle</i>

235
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,800
<i>between Grand Hao Tian Master
and the former pope, Qian Xun Ji.</i>

236
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,870
<i>Today, again with the presence of Hao Tian Hammer,</i>

237
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:42,170
<i>what bloodshed can we foresee?</i>

238
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,940
Gale Devil Wolf 36 Successive Chops.

239
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,940
<i>Only two of them are done,</i>

240
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,600
<i>your fusion skill will be nothing.</i>

241
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,540
<i>So fast.</i>

242
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,510
<i>How could he accelerate
to this extent with their support?</i>

243
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,900
<i>Purple Demon Eye.</i>

244
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,310
[Next Episode]

245
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,200
With Little San’s peculiar sight and technique,

246
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,860
this put Little San into a riskier position.

247
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,820
Why don’t I kill him now?

248
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:02,030
As much of Hao Tian Hammer’s
ability is being exposed,

249
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,740
Martial Soul Hall’s intend of killing
him will be more determined.

250
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,870
Tool Soul Form.

251
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,950
With the tool soul form of Hao Tian Hammer,

252
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,780
I have nearly 70% certainty

253
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,470
to compete with Martial Soul Hall School.

254
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,480
If Tang San uses
the tool soul form again tomorrow,

255
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,410
he’ll either die or be injured.

256
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,180
Withdraw your soul.

257
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,370
Dad.

258
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,350
Why is he here?
