Martial Soul Hall announced that

44
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,430
they’d find the culprits
who destroyed the two tribes.

45
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,120
Simultaneously, they suggested that

46

every existing tribe
be given a year to get prepared.

47

After that,

they’ve proposed the re-election of
the Seven Great Tribes.

<i>Hu Liena. Why is she here?</i>

168
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,610
Nana, do you know him?

169
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,390
He’s my friend.

170
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,010
Tang Yin, are you coming here

171
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,410
to hunt soul beast?

172
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,430
Yes. I’m reaching Level 60 soon.

173
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:23,830
You’re awesome.
You almost reach my brother’s level.

174
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,350
Why are you hunting alone?

175
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,530
It’s too dangerous.

176
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,770
Who else would help me other than myself?

177
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,610
You have me.

178
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:43,050
No. I mean we’re friends.

179
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,150
I don’t care who you are.

180
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:48,610
Since Martial Soul Hall
is carrying out a task in Star Forest,

181
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:51,190
any suspicious person

182
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,530
must be taken down.

183
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,030
Yan!

184
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:58,490
Is Star Forest Martial Soul Hall’s property?

185
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,390
Are you challenging Martial Soul Hall?

186
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,830
You’re from Martial Soul Hall,
but I’m not.

187
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,610
I’m just an individual soul master.

188
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,830
You’re challenging me, not the other way around.

189
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,170
Hu Liena is my friend, but you’re not.

190
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,350
Since no one welcomes me here...

191
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,450
Yan, if you don’t stop now,
I will fight against you.

192
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,430
Nana, he disdained Martial Soul Hall.

193
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,930
I can’t let him get away with that.

194
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,470
Should he disturb our target after he leaves,

195
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,790
the consequence is disastrous.

196
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,570
I’ve said, he’s my friend.

197
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,490
Nana...

198
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:22,290
Brat, I won’t let you get away easily.

199
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,980
Yan acted too rashly, please don’t mind him.

200
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,720
Why don’t you come to our camp

201
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,040
since we haven’t met each other for a year?

202
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,470
We could talk about
our thoughts on Death God Domain.

203
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,890
I’ve been treated as an enemy
before I enter your camp.

204
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:42,370
If I do, I will be accused of stealing information.

205
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,830
Nana, did you say that he had Death God Domain too?

206
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,970
Why don’t you introduce him to us?

[Next Episode]
Silly girl, as long as I’m alive,

218
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,990
I’ll never let them harm you.

219
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,950
I miss you so much.
Meeting you again,

220
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,070
I have no more regrets.

221
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,330
Persuade him to join Martial Soul Hall.

222
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,770
This is one of the reasons I let him stay.

223
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:11,730
Besides,

224
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,550
it’s for your sake.

225

It has been five years, finally...

226
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,770
I haven’t seen you for so long.
You’ve changed a lot.

227
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:18,710
You too.

228
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,050
Is your heart filled with agony

229
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,470
underneath your silence?

230
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,230
What have you been through?

231
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:28,370
You two look good together.
