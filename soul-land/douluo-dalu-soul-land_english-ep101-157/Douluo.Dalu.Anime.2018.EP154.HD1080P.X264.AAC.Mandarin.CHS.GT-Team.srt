You always manage to create miracles.

33

But...

34
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,610
do you think you’ll get lucky again today?

35
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,510
Are you fooling me?

36
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,350
I’d rather die for justice

37
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,650

Do you see the disparity between us now?

42
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,950
Tang San.

43
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,750
This is my domain.

44
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,750
I am the ruler.

45
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,700
<i>This is the real Angel Domain.</i>

46
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,640
<i>I can feel my soul power
being cleansed and weakened again.</i>

<i>If we can’t break this domain,</i>

48

<i>I will die once my soul power is depleted.</i>

49
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,100
Honestly,

50
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,210
I really appreciate you.

51
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,850
I will give you one last chance.

52
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,880
I’ve given you my answer.

53

Fifth Soul Skill, Blue Silver Emperor Tyrant Spear.

Arrival of Angel.

55
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,910
Sixth Soul Skill, Complete Emptiness.

56
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,610
Not bad.

57
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,610
Even the skill generated from
the second evolution of my Angel domain

58
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,980
can do nothing about

59
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,750
your Century Millennium Soul Skill.

60
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,810
But...

61
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,550
it’s not enough.

62
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,210
Fifth Soul Skill, Sacred Sword.

63
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,580
<i>Such a strong energy fluctuation.</i>

64
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,580
<i>Even Complete Emptiness
can’t resist it this time, I’m afraid.</i>

65
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,550
<i>If I use Teleport,</i>

66
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,680
<i>how it will work in his domain</i>

67
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,950

71
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,950
Of.

72
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,680
Random.

00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,900
<i>Skill of Random Hammering</i>

<i>should disturb my Angel Domain.</i>

75
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,500
<i>Tang San,</i>

76
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,540
<i>your hammer skill is quite powerful</i>

77
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,540
<i>but it requires constant strength gathering.</i>

78
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,140
<i>Do you think I’ll let you do that?</i>

79
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,540
<i>I’d like to see</i>

80
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,100
<i>how many times you can withstand my strike.</i>

81
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,740
<i>He stepped back for one meter?</i>

82
00:05:58,517 --> 00:05:59,183
<i>No way.</i>

83
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,817
<i>In my domain,</i>

84
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,483
<i>even if he teleports,</i>

85
00:06:02,783 --> 00:06:04,610
<i>not an inch can he move.</i>

86
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,910
<i>I have combined Ghostly Trace</i>

87
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,380
<i>and Skill of Random Hammering</i>

88
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,210
<i>together with the aid of Teleport.</i>

89
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,480
<i>It’s my original technique,</i>

90
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,250
<i>Skill of Random Dance.</i>

91
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,450
I don’t believe

92
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,450
you can dodge it forever.

93
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,900
<i>It’s the 49th hit.</i>

94

<i>I can’t let him wave his hammer again.</i>

Roaring Angel.

97
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,250
Roaring Angel is a kind of spiritual attack.

98
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,880
Skill of Random Dance.

99
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,810
Eighty-one Strikes in One.

100
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,610
<i>What strong energy fluctuations!</i>

101
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,280
<i>He made it.</i>

102
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,280
<i>I finally managed to break his Angel Domain!</i>

103

<i>Unfortunately,</i>

104
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,550
<i>my soul power has been used up.</i>

105
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,010
How’s that possible?

106
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,280
Even we

107
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,680
can’t break from

108
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,580
Young Master’s domain easily.

109
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,980
Tang San is just a Soul Emperor.

110
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,250
How is it possible

111
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,250
that he greatly injured

112
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,050
Young Master in his domain?

113
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,050
Tang San,

114
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,680
you just keep surprising me.

115
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,110
Part of me wouldn’t want to kill you now.

116
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,110
You’re the second person

117
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,250
who is qualified to be my life-long enemy.

118
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,350
Idiot,

119
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,350
who allowed you to interfere?

120
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:41,549
Young Master,

121
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:42,649
I...

122
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,810
Listen,

123
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,550
even Tang San will die,

124
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,880
he can only die in my hands.

125
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,480
A fair battle

126
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,710
is the last respect I show him.

127
00:08:58,850 --> 00:08:59,950
Yes.

128
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,910
I didn’t expect you

129
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,850
to have a bright side as well.

130
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:14,950
Everyone has their own judgment
about righteousness and evil.

131
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,780
Yet in reality,

132
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,410
the winner

133
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,480
is always upright

134
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,180
and the one that brings light.

<i>the moment the Angel Domain</i>

Tang San,

143
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,410
I’ll end your life with my own hands.

144
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,980
This is the last thing I can do for you.

145
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,140
I will always remember you.

146
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,210
Wait.

147
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,510
Can you tell me who exactly you are?

Although you’re only stalling time here,

150
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,380
I’ll answer your question anyway.

151
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,910
Let me show you who I really am.

152
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,450
That way, I believe

00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,350
you can die without regrets.
