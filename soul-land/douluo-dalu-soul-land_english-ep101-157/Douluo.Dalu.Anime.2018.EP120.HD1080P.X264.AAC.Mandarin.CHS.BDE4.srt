[Next Episode]
Do you know

172
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,130
although it was the first time I met her,

173
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,820
yet she had all my heart.

174
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,710
However, both Elder Brother and I
fell in love with this beautiful woman.

175
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,480
Elder Brother gave up in the end

176
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:55,920
and returned to be the head of the tribe.

177

Hao Tian Tribe

178

went into hiding since then.

The enmity to the Martial Soul Hall

180
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,740
must be revenge.

181
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,530
When I settle all the matters,

182
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,310
you may return to the tribe.

183
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,060
I want you to help rebuild it.

184
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,160
I’ll definitely make it.
