I will definitely obtain consent
from Chief Ning this time.

32
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,020
I’ll never leave you.

You’ll know when you find someone

Why did you leave?

[Soul Land]
[Episode 140]

47
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,400
Tribe of Strength
has been standing for many years.

48
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,080
It’s more than suitable for it to be
the foundation of Tang Clan.

49
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,440
Senior, thank you for your kindness.

Why are you still calling me Senior?

51

Call me Elder.

52
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,460
I should call you Chief now..

53
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,080
Please get up. You may forgo the formalities.

54
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,540
Chief, I’ll go out tomorrow.

55
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,240
Tai Nuo will be in charge of
the early preparation of Tang Clan.

56
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,720
Are you going on a long journey?

57
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,300
Among the subordinates of Hao Tian Tribe,

58
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,920
the Tribe of Defense, Tribe of Agility,
Tribe of Destruction

59
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,540
and my Tribe of Strength

60
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,200
are the top four single attribute tribes.

61
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,280
Since Hao Tian Tribe is closed,
we survive on our own

62
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,970
and promised to meet every two years.

63
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,430
I see.
Recently, Martial Soul Hall is being too active

64
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,730
and the Seven Great Tribes will
be re-selected one year later.

65
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,470
Indeed, you shall meet for a discussion.

66
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,510
Elder, may I go with you?

67
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,710
It’s alright that you go with me,

68
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:04,130
but the other three tribes have been weaken a lot

69
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,590
by the punishment from Martial Soul Hall,

70
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,790
for which they’re holding grudges
with Hao Tian Tribe.

71
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,230
If you hope to get their support,

72
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,870
I’m afraid that you’ll be disappointed.

73
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,680
Hao Tian Tribe indeed let them down.

74
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:20,380
Well... Please let me go with you.

75
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,640
I’d like to do something for them.

76
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,580
Chief, you’re indeed considerate.

77
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,960
Tomorrow morning, we will set off to

78
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,960
Long Xing Town in Xing Luo Empire

79
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,700
to visit the Tribe of Defense.

80
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,060
Elder, I need a batch of ironsmiths.

81
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,420
They must be trustable.

82
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,040
And, they must be the top ironsmiths
who are good at casting.

83
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,840
Can you help me find them?

84
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,980
Chief, don’t you know what we,
the Tribe of Strength, do?

85
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,800
Each of the top four tribes
has different advantages.

86
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,180
We, the Tribe of Strength, are good at casting.

87
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,180
Our specialties are our strength and tolerance.

88
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,460
Tribe of Defense we’re visiting this time

89
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,640
is good at building houses.

90
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,800
Their specialty is more on defense.

91
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:41,380
Tribe of Agility is good at inspection.
They are the best scouts.

92
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,380
Tribe of Destruction is good at making medicine.

93
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,180
Their specialty is the ruthless attack.

94
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:52,480
Though these four tribes
haven’t recovered fully,

95
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:56,060
there are almost a thousand people in total.

96
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,520
I see...

97
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:03,700
Chief, why are you looking for ironsmiths?

98
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,980
Are you making weapons?

99
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,540
Life is so hard.

100
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,920
I’ve just escaped from Tian Dou Empire

101
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,600
and came to Xing Luo...

102
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:33,540
We can’t even earn more than we did in Tian Dou.

103
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,360
These are all I’ve got.

104
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,860
I don’t have much either.

105
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,860
I have...

106
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,740
I... I have...

107
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,920
Fart!

108
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,180
Calm down!

109
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,900
I heard that the top four single attribute tribes
are gathering soon.

110
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,360
They will gather
at Tribe of Defense’s place this year.

111
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,940
Maybe we can...

112
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,420
Be careful! It’s poisoned!

113
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,660
Elder, you...
Did you just break the Godly Zhuge Crossbow?

114
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:51,380
I’m the Vice President of
the Continental Ironsmiths Society

115
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,480
When it comes to the skill of casting,

116
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,680
if I declare myself as the second best,

117
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,260
no one will dare to declare himself as the best.

118
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:03,260
Even my master isn’t better than me
in controlling the fire.

119
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:07,280
But... disassembling the Godly Zhuge Crossbow

120
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,880
will trigger it.

121
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,480
The poison on the gear is highly toxic.

122
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,160
How did you...

123
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,960
This is a unique palm skill
of Tribe of Strength.

124
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,760
Iron Hammering Palm.

125
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:23,500
With it,
our palms wouldn’t be injured during casting.

126
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:26,500
It can isolate most of the poisons, too.

127
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,940
The design of the Godly Zhuge Crossbow
is ingenious.

128
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:37,880
It’s of uniform texture and
sufficient resilience.

129
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:40,419
Chief, don’t worry.

130
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,820
You can leave the mass manufacturing

131
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,470
of Godly Zhuge Crossbow to us.

132
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,040
Thank you, Elder.

133
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,340
After we’re done,

134
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:52,440
we can make a deal with
both Tian Dou Empire and Xing Luo Empire.

135
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:56,360
Not long ago, I came into an agreement
with Qibao Amber Tribe.

136
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:01,100
Tang Clan will exchange weapons
with Qibao Amber Tribe for their supplies.

137
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,560
In that case,

138
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,300
Tang Clan will have
enough money for its establishment.

139
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:09,560
It will also help us a lot
in defeating Martial Soul Hall.

140
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,960
Chief, you’re far more careful than others.

141
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,580
This weapon is amazing.

142
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,880
Why don’t we make more?

143
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,620
I’m thinking about it, too.

144
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,740
With our skill now,

145
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,000
there’s another type of weapon
that we can make.

146
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:30,600
It can at least break the defense of a Soul Saint,

147
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,020
including the martial soul form.

148
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,680
What exactly is that thing so lethal?

149
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,660
When the weapon is launched,

150
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,860
it will be like a peacock flaunting its tail.

151
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,140
It will take a person’s life instantaneously

152
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:49,280
when he is dazzled,
for which it gets the name “Peacock Plumes”.

153
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,260
Peacock Plumes is a one-feet-long cylinder.

154
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,720
On it, there are two buttons.

155
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,360
One is for reloading

156
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,020
and the other button is for shooting.

157
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:05,440
There are a total of 12 types, 365 hidden weapons,

158
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,900
in a Peacock Plumes.

159
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,620
Each of the 12 types

160
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:13,480
has a different function, penetration,
explosion, poisoning and so on.

161
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:16,660
The strongest ones are Needle of Destruction
and Needle of Seven Kills.

162
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,980
They can take a person’s life immediately.

163
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,200
This is the Peacock Plumes.

164
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:31,140
Chief, hurry and tell me...

165
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:38,580
Master San. Grandpa.
You’ve been discussing along the way.

166
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,340
We still have to visit
the Tribe of Defense tomorrow.

167
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,020
Aren’t you resting for a while?

168
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,940
We’re not tired.

169
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,600
You can sleep first if you’re tired.

170
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,520
Here, Chief. Let me have a look...

171
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,200
OK.

172
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:26,440
[Soul Land]

173
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:55,220
The lobbyists from the Martial Soul Hall
are on their way.

174
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,560
Dad, are we really going to be
a affiliated tribe to Martial Soul Hall?

175
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:03,240
Working with the Martial Soul Hall
is like asking a tiger for its skin.

176
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:08,760
However, as the Chief of Tribe of Defense,
I have no choice...

177
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,920
Dad...

178
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:17,760
Hao Tian Tribe... Tang Hao.

179
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:21,440
When you were fighting the Pope,

180
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:24,440
did you even consider us?

181
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:36,700
Chief, this blueprint is ingenious.

182
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,800
Did you draw it yourself?

183
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,200
No, I saw it from a book by chance.

184
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,000
This kind of weapon is called
“hidden weapons” in that book.

185
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,080
My purpose in establishing Tang Clan in Soul Land

186
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,840
is to develop these hidden weapons.

187
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,680
<i>I’ll contribute
what I’ve learned to Tang Clan</i>

188
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,740
<i>and bring Tang Clan to its peak.</i>

189
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:03,680
Chief, you’re young but your experiences
are abnormal.

190
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:07,020
Chief, you said that you need one more thing

191
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:10,220
to create the Peacock Plume. What is that?

192
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,920
This thing is called “Black Iron”.

193
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:18,120
Black Iron? What... What is that?

194
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,620
This... I don’t know what exactly it is called, either.

195
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,720
It’s slightly heavier than normal iron.

196
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,260
If a weapon is created with pure Black Iron,

197
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:30,620
it can defeat most metal weapons.

198
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:34,420
You mean Black Banded Iron, right?

199
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,020
It is much more expensive than gold.

200
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,640
It’s the king of metal.

201
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:43,160
Yes. It’s the Black Banded Iron.

202
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,800
It’s hard to find Black Banded Iron.

203
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:50,300
We have to go to the capital of metal,
Geng Xin Town.

204
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,980
The headquarter of
Continental Ironsmiths Society is there too.

205
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:58,680
Whatever you want, the society
can meet your need.

206
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:02,100
What about the core of Deep Sea Silver?

207
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,800
What... What is this?

208
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:08,020
The Peacock Plume that I mentioned last time

209
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,520
ranks third in the top three long-lost

210
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,340
machinery types of hidden weapons.

211
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,140
The first and the second

212
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,240
are the Angered Buddha’s Lotus

213
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,540
and the Storm Pear Blossom Needle respectively.

214
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,680
Angered Buddha’s Lotus is the strongest
multi-attack hidden weapon.

215
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,020
Unlike the Storm Pear Blossom Needle
and the Peacock Plumes,

216
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,540
its biggest specialty

217
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,220
is its highly concentrated gunpowder.

218
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,240
So it can explode violently in an instant.

219
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,640
It looks like a normal lotus

220
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,980
but its attack range is wide
and it is very powerful.

221
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,340
It can even scare a Grand Soul Land Master.

222
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,760
It’s touted as the supreme hidden weapon.

223
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:47,940
I once developed a Angered Buddha’s Lotus,
but unfortunately...

224
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:52,460
<i>I came with nothing and I’ll go with nothing.</i>

225
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:57,040
<i>This Angered Buddha’s Lotus is the last gift
that I leave for our clan.</i>

226
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:04,640
Though the Storm Pear Blossom Needle
ranks second in machinery type of hidden weapons,

227
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,240
judging its sole attack power,

228
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,960
it’s no worse than the Angered Buddha’s Lotus.

229
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,540
Twenty-seven hidden weapons
can be triggered at the same time.

230
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:15,640
No one can dodge it.
Injuries are inevitable once it’s triggered.

231
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:20,980
Amazing! It’s really marvelous!

232
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,040
To produce the Storm Pear Blossom Needle,

233
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,740
we need the core of Deep Sea Silver.

234
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,180
Deep Sea Mica

235
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:31,080
is a kind of metal ten times more expensive
than the Black Iron.

236
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:35,000
As for its core, it is so precious.

237
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:39,500
Chief, when we reach Geng Xin Town,

238
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:43,260
we can ask the president of the society, Lou Gao.

239
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,320
He will be quite interested in it.

240
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:49,920
Here, after looking at your blueprints,

241
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:54,000
I have a few suggestions in upgrading
the Godly Zhuge Crossbow.

242
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,800
No, your plan is not good.

243
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:07,640
Rascal, how is it not good?

244

They’ve been talking about
hidden weapons the whole trip.

245

Why are they so crazy about hidden weapons?

248
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,260

250

Anyone who wants to enter Long Xing Town

251
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,680
