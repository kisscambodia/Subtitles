00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:18,919
Fifth Soul Skill.

174
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,518
Hurricane Blade!

175
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,119
Shooting Stars of Fire!

176
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,840
<i>The wind is helping the fire</i>

177
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,439
<i>and the fire growing with the wind.</i>

178
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,439
<i>They’ve created a new Double Fusion Skill!</i>

179
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,159
<i>It’s useless.</i>

180
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,039
<i>Brother San’s Blue Silver Emperor is immune to fire.</i>

181
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,119
What?

182
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,399
Tang San.

183
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,119
You are immune to fire,

184
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,838
but you can’t dodge wind.

185
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,159
Let’s fight head-on.

186
00:09:50,719 --> 00:09:51,479
<i>That is my intention.</i>

187
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:00,679
God Killer Attacks.

188
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,370
Xiao Tian!

189
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,280
Xiao Tian.

190
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:40,798
Are you okay?

191
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,199
<i>If I can’t avoid it,</i>

192
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,759
<i>then I’ll stop the wind.</i>

193
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,999
<i>Good for you, Tang San.</i>

194
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,359
<i>I have to use that skill.</i>

195
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:48,399
Fifth Soul Skill.

196
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,879
Fire Dragon!

197
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,758
<i>His fifth soul skill again?</i>

198
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,479
<i>He used a large amount of soul power.</i>

199
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:03,999
Second Soul Skill.

200
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,319
<i>- They want...</i>
- Double Wolf Guard.

201
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,159
Third Soul Skill.

202
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,399
Gale Wings!

203
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,560
This is...

204
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,598
Gale Devil Wolf 36 Successive Chops?

205
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,479
<i>It turns out you wanted to delay time</i>

206
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:16,479
<i>so that he can accumulate his power.</i>

207
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,319
<i>Do you think you can stop me like this?</i>

208
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,479
Fourth Soul Skill.

209
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,959
Blue Silver Spike Formation.

210
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,959
Damn it, this skill is of dizzying effect.

211
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,559
Fifth Soul Skill.

212
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,239
Blue Silver Emperor Tyrant Spear!

213
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,479
<i>Xiao Tian.</i>

214
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,559
<i>Be careful.</i>

215
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,239
Thirty-three.

216
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,199
Thirty-four.

217
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,079
Thirty-five.

218
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,399
<i>He’s about to finish gathering the power.</i>

219
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,439
Tang San.

220
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,319
<i>The speed is even faster.</i>

221
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,719
Tang San.

222
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,679
This skill has advanced a long time ago.

223
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,039
It’s now called

224
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,599
Gale Devil Wolf 54 Successive Chops!

225
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,190
Brother San!

226
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:52,959
<i>Forty.</i>

227
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,879
<i>Forty-one.</i>

228
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,919
<i>Forty-two.</i>

229
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,519
<i>The power of the Gale Wings
seems to have been sealed.</i>

230
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,319
<i>Teleport.</i>

231
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,439
<i>This time, I can’t lose again!</i>

232
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:14,919
Xiao Tian.

233
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,159
Do you still want to continue?

234
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,159
Do you want to feel the power

235
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,959
of my Random Air Hammer Skill?

236
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,479
<i>Three versus one,</i>

237
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,519
<i>yet we still lost.</i>

238
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,399
Shrek is the best.

239
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,959
- Shrek is the best.
- Shrek will always win.

240
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,920
Tang San.

241
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,679
I’ve worked hard to train for five years,

242
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,919
but I still can’t beat you.

243
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,240
It seems that I won’t

244
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,479
be better than you in this lifetime.

245
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:57,799
Xiao Tian.

246
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,679
Don’t be too pessimistic.

247
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,919
It’s only been five years.

248
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,199
We can train for another 10 years,

249
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,799
20 years.

250
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,919
No matter where you go,

251
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,999
I will always be with you.

252
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,839
<i>If Xiao Wu can return to normal</i>

253
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,799
<i>I am willing to give up my power.</i>

254
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,839
<i>The power of a soul master is important.</i>

255
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,479
<i>But for me,</i>

256
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,239
<i>she is more important.</i>

257
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,680
Tang San.

258
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,359
Do we still get to discuss

259
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,879
moving our school in here?

260
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,199
You’ve already lost the bet.

261
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:37,999
What more do you want?

262
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,279
Brother Feng.

263
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,999
If I guessed correctly,

264
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,599
you’re changing your school locations

265
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,199
because of Martial Soul Hall, right?

266
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,599
Tang San.

267
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,919
Dealing things with you

268
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,439
is quite painful.

269
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:53,530
That’s right.

270
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,159
Those bastards in from Martial Soul Hall

271
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,399
keep trying to force us to join forces.

272
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,199
We have no choice

273
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,279
but to move to Tian Dou City.

274
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,879
Based on your performance today,

275
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,519
it seems like you won’t give up
your lead position.

276
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,999
I’m afraid there might be
conflicts among us in the future.

277
00:15:07,999 --> 00:15:08,990
After all,

278
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,679
your school has more students,

279
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:11,879
and is overall

280
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,159
more powerful than Shrek.

281
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,519
We just...

282
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,759
It seems like

283
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,119
we’re destined to part with Shrek School.

284
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,839
When you fight against
the Martial Soul Hall in the future,

285
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,990
don’t forget us.

286
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,030
Goodbye.

287
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,719
What should we do?

288
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,839
Wait until the teachers come back?

289
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,199
The Four Elements School

290
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,999
might be our ally in the future.

291
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,999
But right now,

292
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,319
Shrek School needs to maintain

293
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,439
its dominant position.

294
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,079
We’ll wait for the Dean to decide when he gets back.

295
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,199
Then the Four Elements School

296
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,559
is about to suffer.

297
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,359
Certainly.

298
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,599
When it comes to scamming...

299
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:49,040
I mean,

300
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,159
when it comes to financial smarts,

301
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,999
no one can beat our Dean.

302
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,799
You guys did make the trip worthwhile.

303
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,439
All of a sudden, there’s a Tang Clan

304
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,959
with a thousand soul masters.

305
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,319
It won’t be long

306
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,799
before you surpass

307
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,879
the Qibao Amber Tribe.

308
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,639
Tang Clan was built upon the Four Tribes.

309
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,839
Unless it’s a soul master we wholeheartedly trust,

310
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:16,799
we won’t accept

311
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,719
any newcomers.

312
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,879
Also, besides us and Uncle Ning,

313
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,039
we must keep

314
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,119
all important matters

315
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:21,959
a secret.

316
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,559
Tang Clan will operate
under the name of Tribe of Strength for now.

317
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:25,820
Ok.

318
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,199
Little San.

319
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,159
When are we moving in?

320
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,119
Let’s decide when the teachers are back.

321
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,999
Shrek School is also our home.

322
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,999
We can’t let others come and bully us.

323
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,839
I’ll ask Grandpa Bone for help.

324
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,839
I’d like to see who dares to make trouble here again.

325
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,039
Rong Rong.

326
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,199
If you can get Senior Grand Bone Master

327
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,199
to come and support us,

328
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,799
we can take this opportunity

329
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,599
to go on a long trip.

330
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,439
This time

331
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,599
we need you, the fortune god of Tang Clan.

332
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,399
No problem.

333
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,879
My dad has already given me the first fund

334
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,079
to support the Tang Clan.

335
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,170
Brother San.

336
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,159
Where are we going?

337
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,439
For Tang Clan to create hidden weapons,

338
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,519
we need large amounts of metal.

339
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,799
Tribe of Strength

340
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,690
has a lot of normal metal.

341
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,759
But we lack precious metal.

342
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,639
Elder Tai Tan and I decided

343
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,999
that we needed to visit the Capital of Metal,

344
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,999
Gengxin Town.

345
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,879
Elder Tai Tan has been talking about

346
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,199
the hidden weapons this entire way.

347
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,079
The re-selection meeting of the Seven Great Tribes

348
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,679
is in less than a year.

349
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,719
We have to make some weapons beforehand

350
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:22,040
so that we can have the power

351
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,999
to fight against the Martial Soul Hall.

352
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,319
No matter what,

353
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,919
we need to create some problems
for them this time.

354
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,080
Rong Rong.

355
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,639
What are you doing?

356
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,759
Seek reinforcement, of course.

357
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,159
Once Grandpa Bone is here,

358
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,119
we can leave.

359
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,020
That’s right, Little Ao.

360
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,159
Are there any changes

361
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,190
in Tian Dou City during our absence?

362
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,559
Tian Dou City is still peaceful on the surface.

I heard Uncle Ning said that

364
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,159
it was quite intense in the royal family.

365
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,919
Emperor Xue Ye is seriously ill,

366
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,879
and no royal physicians knows what to do.

367
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,479
Maybe,

368
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,679
something big is about to happen.
