Although everyone knows

32
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,650
Martial Soul Hall is the murderer,

33
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,810
who would dare to suspect them
without evidence?

34
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,770
I’ll forsake my life
if I fail to destroy Martial Soul Hall.

35
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,820
Xie Yue and others have been there
for a long time.

36
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,310
Any news from them?

37
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,080
Now you may go to support them.

38
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,990
Later, there will be an arduous fight.

39
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,480
This person is very dangerous.
Take him down.

40

Sixth Soul Skill, Gear Blade Armour.

41
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,880
Brat, I won’t let you off easily.

42
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,760
Yan, if you don’t stop now,
I will fight against you.

43
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,810
Nana, why don’t you introduce him to us?

44

[Soul Land]
[Episode 132]

45
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,910
Nana, you mentioned
he has Death God Domain too?

46
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,880
Why don’t you introduce him to us?

47
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,310
Brother, he’s Tang Yin
who saved me at the Hell Road.

48
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,070
So, it was you. I should thank you.

49
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,360
You are Nana’s lifesaver.

50
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,630
We were only helping each other.

51
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,150
I need to find a place to rest. I’ll leave now.

52
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,570
You can’t leave.

53
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,140
Yan was right about one thing.

54
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,450
If you leave and

55
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,060
disturbed our target,

56
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,090
all of our efforts will be in vain.

57
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,730
Even I couldn’t bear the consequences.

58
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:40,060
So, you meant I have to stay here.

59
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,510
Grandpa Ghost, he won’t.

60
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:48,010
Maybe I’ll ask him to leave Star Forest first.

61
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,130
Nana, you’re not as smart as before.

62
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,490
Won’t our target

63
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:56,910
appear outside the forest?

64
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,780
Whichever way he takes

65
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,630
will possibly disturb our target.

66
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,120
Not letting you go
doesn’t mean that we’ll harm you.

67
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,480
Your spirit power is useful to us.

68
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,880
As repayment,

69
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,460
I’ll help you hunt the soul beast that suits you.

70
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,350
Please do consider.

71
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,830
Tang Yin...

72
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,780
Do I have other alternatives?

73
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,410
They’re too arrogant.

74
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,010
Does Martial Soul Hall
want to rule the entire continent?

75
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:48,080
Do they think Tian Dou Empire
has no guts to fight them?

76
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,930
Calm down, Your Majesty.

77
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,520
Now we have to come out with
a plan to deal with them.

78
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,180
Apart from a majority of soul masters,

79
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,370
some of the kingdoms and duchies of our empire

80
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,030
are also under the control of Martial Soul Hall.

81
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,160
Please don’t act rashly, Your Majesty.

82
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:07,050
<i>The defense of the palace
has been greatly improved.</i>

83
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,860
How could I not be impulsive?

84
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,450
Chief Ning is loyal to the empire,

85
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,490
but he was almost killed by Martial Soul Hall.

86
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,270
And also Grandmaster...

87
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,120
If I don’t take any actions,

88
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,890
how am I going to face the deceased?

89
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,200
Your Majesty, you should remain calm.

90
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,950
Your forbearance can help us the most.

91
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,990
With my mighty armies,

92
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,210
do you think I’m scared of them?

93
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:53,120
It’s not about fear. We just can’t.

94
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:06,240
Martial Soul Hall has at least
20,000 powerful soul masters

95
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,250
and more than ten Grand Soul Land Masters.

96
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,050
Perhaps they can’t compete with
your armies in quantity.

97
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,950
But they have the support of Guardian Knights

98
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,480
and many small countries.

99
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,090
We don’t have enough soul masters

100
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,070
and we lack capable leaders.

101
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:29,360
That’s why we have to endure.

102
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:38,270
Any suggestions, Grandmaster?

103
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,060
To fight with Martial Soul Hall,

104
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,940
we must collaborate with all parties
who are opposed to them.

105
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:54,170
Do you mean collaborating with Xing Luo Empire?

106
00:06:54,170 --> 00:07:00,370
But Tian Dou has feuded with Xing Luo
for ages, I’m afraid...

107
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,930
Your Majesty, there’s no eternal enemy

108
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:09,290
in this world, but eternal benefit.

109
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:14,140
Xing Luo Empire would also be afraid of
their strength and artifice.

110
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,990
Collaboration is inevitable.

111
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,450
Besides...

112
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,850
Martial Soul Hall has started their plan.

113
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,900
As for us, we’re still short of competent people.

114
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,890
So, we must recruit
more individual soul masters to join us.

115
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:32,800
Destroying Martial Soul Hall
can’t be done within a short period.

116
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,530
Please make a long-term plan, Your Majesty.

117
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,410
I see what you mean.

118
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:47,130
Grandmaster, any suggestions on
recruiting soul masters?

119
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,420
My tribe has been wiped out
so I’m so distracted now.

120
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,530
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

121
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,850
But please be rest assured.

122
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,570
I’ll train our soul masters as much as I can

123
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,700
so that they’ll be prepared for the battle
as soon as possible.

124
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,760
Without further ado, let’s discuss it now.

125
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,120
Hao Tian Tribe...

126
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,080
Grandpa Ghost,

127
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,370
is this why you let Tang Yin stay?

128
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,030
Yes. Nana,

129
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:41,090
find out the reason why he left the tribe.

130
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:44,720
Maybe he can help us

131
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,590
snoop into Hao Tian Tribe’s internal affairs.

132
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,390
Grandpa Ghost,

133
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:04,970
we’ve already known where Hao Tian Tribe is.

134
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,770
Why do we need him?

135
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:13,420
Girl, you’re blinded by your emotions.

136
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,470
Hao Tian Tribe

137
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,510
is one of the reasons why I let him stay.

138
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:32,060
Besides, it’s for your sake.

139
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,290
Grandpa Ghost, don’t say that...

140
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,500
If you really want to be with him,

141
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,200
his identity

142
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,420
is an inevitable problem that you can’t avoid.

143
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,190
Persuade him to join Martial Soul Hall.

144
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:51,090
You are such a good match.

145
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,170
Brat, mark my words.

146
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:02,750
If you dare to get close to Nana,
I’ll kill you.

147
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,960
Do you think you can?

148
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,960

00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,200
It’s late, rest early.

151
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,270
I won’t let you off easily.

152
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,620
Come in.

153
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,230
Eat something.

154
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,740
I’m so sorry for troubling you.

155
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,970
After we finish the task,
you may leave whenever you want.

156
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,910
You’re here to convince me to
join Martial Soul Hall.

157
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,450
I won’t do anything futile.

158
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,050
You’re a smart one.

159
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,730
However, I’m curious

160
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,950
what Martial Soul Hall is going to do

161
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,030
by gathering so many people in Star Forest?

162
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,700
We’re going to hunt a powerful soul beast.

163
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,400
We will possibly encounter some trouble,

164
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,710
so we come in a big group, just in case.

165
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,660
A Decade Millenium Soul Beast?

166
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,670
Yes.

167
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,030
<i>It’s Xiao Wu.</i>

168
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:11,090
<i>I must snoop for more information from her.</i>

169
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,100
Where’s Nana?

170
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,930
It’s been a while. You’ve changed a lot.

171
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,570
Although you were as cold as ever
when we met last night,

172
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:23,960
your personality has changed.

173
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,270
You’re maturer and more sophisticated now.

174
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,060
So are you.

175
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,670
Teacher spent a lot of time and effort

176
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:33,370
to help me control my heinous spirit.

177
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,880
Speaking of which,
obviously you’re much more talented than I am.

178
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,050
Not really.

179
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,960
After leaving Slaughter City,

180
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,420
I failed to control my heinous spirit.

181
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,810
and turned the tribe upside down.

182
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:51,770
That’s why I was expelled from Hao Tian Tribe.

183
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,950
<i>So, under your calmness,</i>

184
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,270
<i>you’re filled with agony.</i>

185
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,570
<i>Tang Yin, what have you been through?</i>

186
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,200
I won’t ask about your tribe’s anymore.

187
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,130
If you don’t have anywhere else to go,

188
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,120
come to Martial Soul Hall with me.

189
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,070
Teacher will definitely appreciate you.

190
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,120
Martial Soul Hall and Hao Tian Tribe
are antagonistic.

191
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,920
They won’t accept a person from Hao Tian Tribe.

192
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,610
It depends on whether you can impress my teacher.

193
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,470
Let’s set off.

194
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:50,270
The target is at the center of Star Forest.

195
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,470
<i>Nana has tested him yesterday.</i>

196
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,810
<i>He’s trustable.</i>

197
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,480
<i>The plan went well.</i>

198
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,370
<i>First, pretend to expose
my Blue Silver Domain to attract them.</i>

199
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:16,160
<i>Then, gain their trust by acting as
an expelled disciple of Hao Tian Tribe.</i>

200
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,050
<i>Next,</i>

201
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,740
<i>it’s time to use the Blue Silver Domain.</i>

202
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:31,050
<i>We’re getting closer to the center of the forest.</i>

203
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,890
<i>This...</i>

204
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,750
Tang Yin, what’s wrong?

205
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:04,860
<i>He must be backlashed.</i>

206
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,380
The aura...

207
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,890
<i>It’s the aura of two
Decade Millenium Soul Beasts. Xiao Wu...</i>

208
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:18,480
<i>Xiao Wu must be around here nearby.</i>

209
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,890
<i>Welcome to Start Forest.</i>

210
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,950
<i>Xiao Wu. It has been five years. Finally...</i>

211
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,290
<i>I must find a chance to save Xiao Wu.</i>

212
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,860
<i>You have looked for me for a long time, right?</i>

213
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,360
<i>You’ve found me now.
Why don’t you dare to come?</i>

214
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:17,410
<i>King of Forest, Titan Giant Ape.</i>

215
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,250
<i>Amongst all Grand Soul Land Masters,</i>

216
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,310
<i>Tang Hao is the only one
who defeated Titan Giant Ape.</i>

217
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:48,090
<i>It’s Xiao Wu. How come Xiao Wu is with it?</i>

218
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:52,650
<i>Was it protecting Xiao Wu that time?</i>

219
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,220
<i>This is bad.</i>

220
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:36,480
Martial Soul Hall, let’s put an end to this today.

This is...

Tang San?

Tang Yin is...

234
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,540
Why?

235
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,760
Brother, I miss you so much.

236
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:04,850
I have no regrets anymore
after seeing you.

237
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:12,060
Silly girl, as long as I’m still alive,

238
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,050
I’ll never let them hurt you.
