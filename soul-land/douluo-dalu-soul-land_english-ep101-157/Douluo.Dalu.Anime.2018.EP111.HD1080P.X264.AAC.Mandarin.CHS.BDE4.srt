Theoretically,

79
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,690
Grandmaster’s tutelage is profound.

80
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,880
But, you lack the essence of combating.

The essence?

82
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,980

It helps you to display your strength

Even when confronting rivals
far more formidable than yourself,

you’ll never give in either.

93

Heinous spirit itself
is not terrifying,

94

but the possessor
who has experienced countless deaths.

95

death nor his rivals.

As such, I can’t truly experience death,

<i>Meaning to say,</i>

165
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,320
<i>the quality of your mother’s
martial soul, Blue Silver Plant</i>

166
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,440
<i>is very close to
your father’s martial soul.</i>

167
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,270
All Blue Silver lines are your people.

168
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,030
Haven’t you felt
their calls towards you?

169
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,240
Calls?

170
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,890
Every Blue Silver Emperor in this world
is from the same origin.

171
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:03,480
Only when
the last Blue Silver Emperor died,

172
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,430
the next emperor will appear.

173
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,300
Although you’re a human,

174
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:13,360
but, you’re the only one who possesses
the royal blood of Blue Silver Emperor.

175
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,840
I always thought that my strength

176
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,850
originates from my special practice.

177
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,140
This is our mistake.

178
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:27,690
Because your royal blood hasn’t awaken.

179
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,840
My martial soul has once awaken,

180
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,050
is it going to awake again?

181
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,430
My Great King.

182
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:39,850
how could ordinary people awaken
your noble blood?

183
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,950
As your loyal subject,

184
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:45,050
we’ll always protect you.

185
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:49,840
Do you wish to shelter
your subjects forever?

186
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,660
I do.

187
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,910
It has been twenty years,
I haven’t felt the king’s aura.

188
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:36,060
King, please feel the loyalty
of your subjects.

189
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,100
Mom.

190
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:16,859
Mom.

191
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:28,620
My Great King, please rest assure.

192
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:02,760
The real Blue Silver Emperor
has finally awaken.

193
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,920
[Next Episode]
Give me two shots of Netherworld.

194
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,360
No, Dad.

195
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,210
Your injury is severe.

196
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,800
If you don’t take good care,

197
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,590
possibly you’ll...

198
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,590
Don’t bother about me.

199
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,720
How could I?

200
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,920
If you die,

201
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,880
how about me?

202
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,370
Cut that crap.

203
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,870
I hate cowardice.

204
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,130
Ah Yin.

205
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,280
Mom.

206
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,670
This is

207
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,010
the real form of my Blue Silver Plant.

208
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,160
Yes, King.

209
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,400
Its name is...
