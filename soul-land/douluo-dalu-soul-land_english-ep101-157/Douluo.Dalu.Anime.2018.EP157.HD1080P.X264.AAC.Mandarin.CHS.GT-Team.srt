Send my orders.

33
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:16,332
Assemble all of the Martial Soul Hall’s troops,

34
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,915
and destroy the power

35
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,290
of the Tian Dou royal family.

36
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,749
You really are cruel, Qian Ren Xue.

37
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,582
My suggestion

38
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,832
is for you to go to an extremely dangerous place

39
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,999
where you can quickly improve your skills.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,207
From today onward,

41
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,207
Fourth Prince Xue Beng

42
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,749
will be the crown prince
of Tian Dou Empire!

00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,165
has officially begun.

46
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:40,624
How should I maintain the peace?

[Episode 157]

48
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,165
We won the fight at the Tian Dou Palace

49
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,707
all thanks to the power

50
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,290
of Tang Clan.

51
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,957
Emperor Xue Ye

52
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,957
also complimented you as well.

Little Freak.

54
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,749
Count me in Tang Clan as well.

55
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,332
Just give me an honorary elder title.

56
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,124
Of course.

57
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,124
Can I stop you?

58
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,165
But

59
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,665
aren’t you used to freedom,

60
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,457
and don’t want to be in any clan?

61
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,749
Isn’t this your clan?

62
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,749
I mean,

63
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,749
are you going to judge me?

64
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,874
I do like freedom.

65
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,457
But that was when I was young.

66
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,665
Now that I’m older,

67
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,499
I’ll spend my retirement

68
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,124
in Tang Clan,

69
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,999
of my food and living space.

70
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,332
Call me when there’s a fight

71
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,665
or things get busy.

Why make it sound so sad?

74
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,874
As long as you’re willing,

75
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,290
I will take care of your retirement.

80

If I go,

81
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,374
I likely wori’t be able to participate in it.

82
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,874
Do you think

83
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,874
that with the power we have right now,

84
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,665
we can stop the Martial Soul Hall

85
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,665
from finishing the Contest?

00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,165
even the Martial Soul Hall

88
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,165
won’t make any risky moves.

89

Choosing

90
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,999
to leave now

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,790
to improve your skills

92
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,374
and hone your power

93
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,374
is the best move.

94
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,415

95
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,582

You are not the only one
that needs training.

The others in the Shrek Seven Devils

99

are all at a similar bottleneck.

Also,

101
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,207
if you go together,

102
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,665
you can take care of each other.

103

104
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,040
How could I not be worried

105
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,082
unless the seven of you

106
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,749
took on this challenge together?

107
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:42,040
Teacher thought through all of this for me?

00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,082
We won’t be back

176
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,290
in a few years probably.

177
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,790
Where are you going to train?

178
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:16,790
Haishen Island.

179
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,290
I don’t know

180
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,457
if you’ve heard of it before.

181
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:20,665
What?

182
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:22,999
You’re going to Haishen Island?

183
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,332
You know about it?

184
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:26,874
How would I not know?

185
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,249
Your father and I went there before.

186
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,582
Little San.

187
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,124
That place is no joke.

188
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,249
Your great-grandfather, Tang Chen,

189
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,540
and Qian Dao Liu

190
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,540
were both defeated there back then.

191
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,540
Great-grandfather?

192
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,540
Qian Dao Liu?

193
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,415
Uncle.

194
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,540
What actually happened?

195
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,665
Your great-grandfather, Tang Chen,

196
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,290
was a Level 99 Grand Soul Land Master.

197
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,165
Back then,

198
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,165
he and the Martial Soul Hall’s Head Flamen

199
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,165
and also

200
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,165
the Judicial Elder, Qian Dao Liu,

201
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,707
were know as the two leaders
of the soul master world.

202
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:01,332
[Star Forest]

203
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,832
Your great-grandfather was
a bit more powerful than Qian Dao Liu,

204
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,832
but the gap was very small.

205
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,832
Level 99?

206
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,624
Then who defeated

207
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:11,957
my great-grandfather and Qian Dao Liu?

208
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,332
Grand Ocean Master from Haishen Island,

209
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,290
Bo Sai Xi.

210
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:18,374
Her power is equal to Qiao Dao Liu’s,

211
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:19,999
but on Haishen Island,

212
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,207
she can harness the power of the ocean

213
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,624
Unless it’s someone of Level 100 or higher,

214
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,165
no one can defeat her.

215
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,165
A Level 100 soul master is just a legend

216
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,165
on the continent.

217
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,749
No wonder Great-Grandfather
and Qian Dao Liu failed.

218
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,124
Little San.

219
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,874
When outsiders set foot on the Haishen Island,

220
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,874
even if they pass the challenge,

221
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,874
they still won’t be able to leave.

222
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,415
Have you really decided to go?

223
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:45,874
Since we’re going,

224
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,540
we will definitely pass the challenges

225
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:48,915
and think of a way to return safely.

226
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,915
Alright.

227
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,415
You young people

228
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:55,999
are really confident.

229
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,749
Your father and I didn’t expect this.

230
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,415
Since the elders

231
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,415
have acknowledged you,

232
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:05,624
then

233
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,165
I should pass some of our clan’s secret skills

234
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,499
to you.

235
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,374
Thank you, Uncle.

236
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:43,832
[Soul Land]

237
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,290
First Skill, Phoenix Firing Line!

238
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,165
Little Ao.

239
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,124
Be careful of Chen Xiang.

240
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,290
Second Skill, Flying Swallow!

241
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,082
Sixth Skill, Cloning Sausage!

242
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,207
Jiubao Boosts.

243
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,165
You Fatty,

244
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,207
get out of my way!

245
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,124
You knew I was fast,

246
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,165
but you still blocked me.

247
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,624
Did you do that on purpose?

248
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,082
I was afraid you would get hurt.

249
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,540
If you just rush over,

250
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,249
you might fall into a trap.

251
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:40,832
Xiang.

252
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,832
Fatty is right.

253
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,540
Brother San’s martial soul is focused on control.

254
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:46,832
Your speed is fast,

255
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,040
but if you get caught
in the Constraint of Spider Web,

256
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,374
you won’t be able to escape.

257
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,832
I think he

258
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,749
just wanted to show off.

259
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,249
Xiang,

260
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,624
we...

261
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,415
How many times did I tell you?

262
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,415
Don’t call me Xiang!

263
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,624
Fatty has really met his match this time.

264
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,290
It seems like

265
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,957
Grandmaster’s suggestion was right.

266
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,457
When we’re together,

267
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,665
we’re very happy every day.

268
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,165
Without pressure,

269
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,790
we won’t have the motivations to train.

270
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:18,915
Ever since we came back,

271
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,290
to be honest,

272
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,290
I haven’t been focused on training at all.

273
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,999
I just want to be with you.

274
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:26,582
Me, too.

275
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:29,832
Hey,

276
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:30,540
Little Ao!

277
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,207
You’re actually willing to come back?

278
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,332
Zhu Qing!

279
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:39,499
I’m begging you!

280
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:44,915
Let me hug you for a bit longer.

281
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:47,540
Boss Dai.

282
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,207
Can’t you be more gentle?

283
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:54,540
It’s a good thing you came back alive.

284
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,582
You got a scar?

285
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,874
I’m finally more handsome than you.

286
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,749
But you’re still not the most handsome.

287
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,749
Don’t forget about Little San.

288
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,832
Little San?

289
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:11,124
Who will compare with him who is not even human?

290
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,540
Senior Qin.

291
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,124
Boss Dai!

292
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:24,624
Come here.

293
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:25,540
Let me ask you.

294
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,165
Fatty.

295
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,207
You have good taste.

296
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:40,749
Who is this...

297
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,207
Boss Dai.

298
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:49,749
Please don’t say anything bad about me.

299
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,915
I’m serious this time.

300
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,165
Are you actually serious this time?

301
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,165
Let’s go,

302
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:56,790
Boss Dai.

303
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,457
Let’s talk on the side.

304
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,665
Little Ao and I have a lot to tell you.

305
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,207
Where are Little San and Xiao Wu?

306
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,790
The Shrek Seven Devils

307
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,499
is now only without Little San and Xiao Wu.

308
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,207
Ah Yin.

309
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,415
Do you feel it too?

310
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,749
Dad.

311
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,915
Your mom is very happy that you’re back.

312
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,415
She is welcoming you.

313
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:50,957
I know.

314
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:52,582
I know.

315
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,374
Why are you crying?

316
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,374
You should be happy.

317
00:17:58,708 --> 00:17:59,457
Dad.

318
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,957
Mom is growing much faster

319
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,415
than I expected.

320
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:03,665
I believe

321
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,249
that she will definitely recover.

322
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,040
I believe so as well.

323
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,040
Little San.

324
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:11,874
Did you know?

325
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,832
Watching your mom’s body grow everyday

326
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,374
s my biggest satisfaction.

327
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:20,790
Coming back this time,

328
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,790
I want to ask you both for a favor.

329
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:45,850
Xiao Wu.

330
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:48,950
Will you marry me?
