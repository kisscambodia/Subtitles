Hu Liena is wrong. What about you?

53
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,510
You are the top elders of Martial Soul Hall,

and two Grand Soul Land Masters,

55

but you were tricked by a young man

56
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,410
and caused the Century Millennium Soul Beast
to sacrifice.

57

Battle skills are important,

are more important.

If you don’t train hard today,

97
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,280

He’s paralyzing himself by doing this.

109
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,660
Watch out for your upper front!

110
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,580
Maybe, only Little San’s return

I’ve tried to gather
our tribe members everywhere

114
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,460
but I realized there are
only no more than a hundred people.

115
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,820
Their ability is average. We really can’t...

They are contacting Xing Lou Empire.

We have Mu Bai and Zhu Qing’s help,

and this advantages both empires share.

120
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,240
Joining hands shouldn’t be a problem.

121
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,360
Though we are trying our best,

122
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,880
if a war indeed takes place,

123

I’ll bring you back here.

00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,010
You will revive.

130
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,110
Do you know what you are going to lose?

131
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,680
You have to return Sister Wu’s soul bone to her

132
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,500
and give her the nine soul rings
of a Grand Soul Land Master.

133
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,260
This means you will transfer
your martial soul into her body.

134
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,480
Your cultivation accumulated
in all these years will be in vain.

135
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,520
Forget about the martial soul
and the cultivation.

136
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,860
Xiao Wu, without you, all of these are meaningless.

Can he make it?

140
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,820
I can’t understand the feelings between them.

141
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:35,880
But, I believe Tang San will revive Sister Wu.

142
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,220
I hope so.

143
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,780
Sister Wu is so silly.

144
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,240
So is Tang San.

145
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,440

00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,700
- Umbrella! Umbrella!
- Boss, how much are they?

150
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,620
This umbrella is cheap and nice.

151
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,020
- Give me one, please.
- Choose whichever you like.

Rascal! Kill him!

<i>Who’s in the car?</i>

158
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,000
- How dare he offend the Fourth Prince?
- He’s in big trouble.

159
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,700
But, he’s so powerful. These are the royal guards,

160
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,940
the key warriors
for the royal family of Tian Dou Empire.

161
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,200
He beat them so easily.

162
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,800
Come on!

163
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,560
Damn!

164
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,100
<i>Xue Beng is still so arrogant and bossy.</i>

Stay out of it if you don’t want to die.

<i>he’s still a soul master.</i>

169

<i>He should know my rank is much higher than his.</i>

170
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,820
<i>In this situation,
he still insists to fight against me.</i>

171
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,980
<i>Is he so confident that Old Freak will help him?</i>

172
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,610
<i>Or is he doing it on purpose?</i>

173
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,680
You have your own territory

174
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,510
and great soul power at such a young age.

175

Even Little Freak can’t achieve what you have now.

Who exactly are you?

177
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,640
Old Freak, long time no see.

178
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:06,100
Senior, he’s the one who made a mess.

179

You are...

180
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,740
Does this prove who I am?

181
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,160
Little Freak.

182
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,850
Old Freak, let’s talk elsewhere.

183
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,320
Ok.

184
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,750
It’s just a misunderstanding.

185
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,350
He’s my friend.

186
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,650
Take care of the rest here.

187
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,750
Old Freak.

188
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,380
Since when has your perception become so bad?

189
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,910
Stop it.

190
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,700
Though everything indicates
that you’re Little Freak.

191
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,680
But, Little Freak doesn’t look like you.

192
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,660
- Losers, clean this up.
- Yes, Your Highness.

193
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,040
Little Freak, you are indeed a monster.

194
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,440
You are of the bloodline of soul beasts.

195
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,920
Old Freak,
although my mother was born a soul beast,

196
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,150
when she was carrying me,

197
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,920
she had already become a human.

198
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,900
But, I never think that this would happen again.

199
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,700
If it weren’t for Martial Soul Hall,

200
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,660
our family wouldn’t have ended up like this.

201
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,800
This cannot be forgiven.

202
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,780
<i>I didn’t know Little Freak
had gone through so much.</i>

203
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,410
What are you planning to do next?

204
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,600
Take revenge on Martial Soul Hall?

205
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,960
Not now.

206
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,200
I’ll only attack Martial Soul Hall

207
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,800
when I have enough energy.

208
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,940
Old Freak.

209
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,440
Why are you still with people like Xue Beng?

210
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,020
Is this kind of people worth your protection?

211
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,760
Little Freak.

212
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,750
You can’t judge things by what you see.

213
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,020
Mostly,

214
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,250
you have to look into a person
to learn his nature.

215
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,380
Do you know why Xue Beng is so unruly?

216
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,080
Actually, it’s all caused by Xue Qing He.

217
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,110
Do you mean there’s something wrong with Xue Qing He?
