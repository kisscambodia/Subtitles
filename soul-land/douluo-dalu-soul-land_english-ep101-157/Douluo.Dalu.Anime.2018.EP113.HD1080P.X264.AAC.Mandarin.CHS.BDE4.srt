It has existed for thousands of years.

It’s a domain by a robust soul master
after he broke through the Level 100.

95
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,320
You can initiate martial soul here.

96
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,100
But soul skill is ineffective.

97
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,780
Soul power too?

98
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:13,070
You can use it as the source of power.

I don’t want to kill anymore, let me go.

There’re fools around.

The mighty Slaughter King
controls everything here.

109
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,180
Besides, the enforcement team is

110
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:20,030
formed from the Great Soul Land Masters
and they’re allowed to use soul skills.

00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,410
Leaving without permission?
That’s impossible.

112

Is there any way out?

113
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,660
Only one way.

will be bestowed as Death God.

Not the real Slaughter City.

Some of them are

130

They need to contribute
two shots of Netherland every month

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,920
to seek protection from Slaughter King.

132

Only the inner city
is not governed by any rules.

00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,510
Bring me to Hell Slaughter Arena.

You’d better be careful.

It seems like you’re a rookie,

149
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,500
but you don’t need my protection.

150

Anyway, don’t approach her.

She’s terribly strong.

Although she was here just a year,

154
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,130
however, she has won 16 times
on the Hell Slaughter Arena.

155
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:20,089
This result will qualify her
in the top 100.

Just 16 wins is able to rank top 100?

Do you think it’s same as
the battle in Soul Arena?

158

It’s quite horrifying

159
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,710

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,360
hidden weapon can’t pierce through
their armour as well.

168
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,200
This is our strategy.

169
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,100
This is the determination act.

170
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,900
In the past thousand years,

171
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:24,880
you’re the third from Hao Tian Tribe
to enter Slaughter City.

172
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,410
In Slaughter City,

173
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,280
friendship never exist here.
