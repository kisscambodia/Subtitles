So these soul bones

We renounce this match

and fight with Shrek School

31
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,850
for the grand final’s quota.

Gale Devil Wolf 36 Successive Chops.

38
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,960
How can this happen?

39
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,600
Last time, Captain endured longer time
while competing with Tang San.

40
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,810
But he is defeated very quickly this time.

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,390
Damn. If we did manage to hinder Tang San last time,

42
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,970
this wouldn’t happen today.

43
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,540
Both were fusion skills.

44
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,090
Six teammates were working
together to support Little San.

45
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,720
But there were only three
behind Feng Xiao Tian.

46
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,720
The great difference
between the total soul power

47
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,390
made Little San have an overwhelming advantage.

48
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,670
Apart from that, Feng Xiao Tian
did the biggest mistake of

49
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,820
using the Gale Devil Wolf
36 Successive Chops again.

50
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,900
This is his most powerful ability.

51
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,320
It exerted enormous pressure to Little San last time.

52
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,890
Why shouldn’t he use it again?

53
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,330
The previous experience did

54
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,170
trigger Little San to conduct
an in-depth investigation.

55
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:49,810
He realized

56
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,650
Gale Devil Wolf 36 Successive Chops

57
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,430
has a similar defect as Random Air Hammer Skill,

58
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,520
in which

59
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,430
its power can’t exert at all

60
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,560
once it’s interrupted at initial of its exertion.

61
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,910
The successive chops and increases of power

62
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,130
are the most terrifying strengths of the skill.

63
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,020
While Feng Xiao Tian was accelerating,

64
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,860
Hao Tian Hammer was
thrown accurately by Little San on him.

65
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,020
It was just in time that Feng Xiao Tian
hadn’t fully exerted his power yet.

66
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,610
With Little San’s peculiar sight and technique,

67
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,330
he must have known
Feng Xiao Tian’s motion track.

68
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,570
He managed to shot at his wings,
instead of his chest.

69
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,070
This saved Feng Xiao Tian’s life. But...

70
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,850
this put Little San into a riskier position.

71
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,110
As much of Hao Tian Hammer’s
ability is being exposed,

72
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,200
Martial Soul Hall’s intention of killing
him will be more determined.

73
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,940
The size of the hammer is bigger than Little San’s body.

74
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,040
Yet, he can still hold it steadily.

75
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,170
The atmosphere changed.

76
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,760
Brother San seems to have fused
with Hao Tian Hammer as one already.

77
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,320
Tool soul form!

78
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,440
<i>No. This is impossible.
He’s just at his Level 43.</i>

79
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,730
<i>How can he perform the
tool soul form of above Level 70?</i>

80
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,740
Although the Seven in One Fusion Skill
that I taught them

81
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,640
is not as great as
the Martial Soul Fusion Skill,

82
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,410
it can gather everyone’s powers

83
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,790
to exert as one.

84
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,420
By the time, Little San’s soul power

85
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,460
is the result of superimposed
soul power of seven persons.

86
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,230
Plus the superimposed increase of
Qibao Amber Pagoda,

87
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,510
Little San’s soul power

88
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,850
is even more advanced
to Level 70 and above.

89
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,910
This is why

90
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,490
Little San can break the soul power gap
of 30 levels incredibly

91
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,940
and being able to control
the tool soul form.

92
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,430
The seventh soul skill of beast soul master
must be the martial soul form,

93
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,930
transforming himself as the martial soul itself.

94
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,210
It has enormous explosive power.

95
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,760
Its strength is increased by infinite times.

96
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:40,700
However, the seventh soul skill of tool soul master
is the tool soul form,

97
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,280
transforming himself as
the tool martial soul itself.

98
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,890
It makes the tool martial soul’s power
rise to an extreme.

99
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:49,260
If the tool martial soul itself is very powerful,

100
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,640
the explosive power of tool martial soul form

101
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,750
will be more terrifying than it.

102
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,690
They have not given up yet.

103
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:00,590
They’re indeed the respectable
opponents for the kids.

104
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,150
Hao Tian Hammer. Random Air Hammer Skill.

105
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,020
They’ve already defeated the opponents.

106
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,770
But Little San still want to use Random Air Hammer Skill?

107
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,540
I’m afraid that the whole auditorium
will be destroyed in one blow.

108
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,770
This astonishing power is...

109
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:59,730
The world’s first tool martial soul,
Hao Tian Hammer.

110
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,610
<i>Stop!</i>

111
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:03,950
<i>Dad!</i>

112
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,290
<i>Restrain your power.</i>

113
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,580
<i>Withdraw your soul.</i>

114
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,280
<i>No. How come he’s here?</i>

115
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,360
<i>It should be Master.</i>

116
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,320
<i>This is tool soul form.</i>

117
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,540
<i>It’s not only the soul power,</i>

118
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:43,050
<i>I feel myself to be fused with
Hao Tian Hammer as one.</i>

119
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,770
<i>So that the genuine
martial soul form can be used.</i>

120
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,010
Restrain.

121
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:57,100
<i>Fortunately, without Master’s reminding in time,</i>

122
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,930
<i>I might have lost control
and my soul might be drained as well.</i>

123
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,060
I announced that the winner
of this round is Shrek School.

124
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,860
Great!

125
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,920
Tomorrow’s final round

126
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,730
will be kicked off in between
Martial Soul Hall School and Shrek School.

127
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,190
Master, thanks to you.

128
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,090
Unexpectedly,

129
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:39,260
you can even use the tool soul form
of Hao Tian Hammer.

130
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,520
It’s exactly the world’s first tool martial soul.

131
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,360
It’s my mistake.

132
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,680
The kids have been exhausted for today.

133
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,600
Let’s head back to have some minor
adjustments and plan for the next.

134
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,780
All right.

135
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:31,080
[Soul Land]

136
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,650
Although everyone seems to be fine,

137
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,310
the soul power has actually depleted greatly,

138
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:00,400
especially Little San.
He has used the tool soul form.

139
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,420
His soul power might have been drained.

140
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,500
Little San, will your soul power

141
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,250
recover to its optimum state
for tomorrow’s final round?

142
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,530
I have foundation strengthening medicines.

143
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,530
It’s not a problem for the soul power to recover.

144
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,300
Plans can’t keep up with the changes.
I’ve made a false forecast.

145
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,930
Grandmaster, we’ve defeated
Shen Feng School in this round.

146
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,960
This can be said as a perfect victory.

147
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,930
Right.

148
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:41,770
Seven in One Fusion Skill was delivered
by Grandmaster to us before the match

149
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,500
and Little San was asked to give the command

150
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,490
to defeat the opponents in the fastest speed.

151
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:49,310
The tactic was well executed, wasn’t it?

152
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:53,020
If I knew in advance that
Little San can use tool soul form,

153
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,970
it would be a different tactic for today.

154
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,410
By having tool soul form of Hao Tian Hammer,

155
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:01,130
I have nearly 70% certainty

156
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,250
to compete with Martial Soul Hall School.

157
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,770
But revealing it in prior now
would make things worse.

158
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,160
Is it possible for them

159
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,250
to figure out our Seven in One
Fusion Skill by just one night?

160
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:16,220
Others than that, the opponent team tomorrow

161
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,530
is supported by Martial Soul Hall.

162
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,310
There are countless talents

163
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,020
and the Grand Soul Land Masters
in Martial Soul Hall.

164
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,780
They can always come up
with the countermeasures.

165
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:31,170
Did you understand what I’ve told you just now?

166
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:34,060
Understood, Your Holiness.

167
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:38,140
If Tang San uses the tool soul form again tomorrow,

168
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,350
he’ll either died or injured.

169
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,270
It’s unnecessary to care about it.

170
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:46,350
You only need to focus on
the Seven in One Fusion Skill.

171
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,580
Destroy it as what I’ve told just now.

172
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,090
By your genuine strength,

173
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:55,710
they’re impossible to be your opponents.

174
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,890
Yes.

175
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,740
You’d have known that
the benefits of this tournament.

176
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,010
It’s a chance to make you famous.

177
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:07,850
It also decides
the ownership of the three soul bones.

178
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,150
There are Qibao Amber Tribe

179
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,450
and many Advanced Soul Master Schools
paying attention to this.

180
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,950
Martial Soul Hall couldn’t break the promise.

181
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,620
Moreover,

182
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,800
Little San couldn’t perform the tool soul form
again for the time being.

183
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,320
Otherwise, he’ll be suffered
from unforeseen trauma.

184
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,120
It may affect his future as well.

185
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:38,240
Tool soul form and martial soul form
have the same effects of different natures,

186
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,950
or even more powerful.

187
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,220
The most terrifying part of the tool soul form

188
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,210
is to fuse the soul master himself with
tool martial soul itself as one.

189
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,270
It will use up the spirit power.

190
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,010
Spirit power?

191
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,180
It’s different from soul power.

192
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,210
The spirit power can only be
supplied by soul master himself.

193
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,950
With the current strength of Little San,

194
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:58,460
his spirit is still far from a stable state.

195
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,900
If he keeps it on,

196
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,950
his spirit will suffer from severe trauma.

197
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,150
For the minor trauma, he’ll lose memory
and become unresponsive.

198
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:08,430
For the severe trauma,
he’ll become unconscious at all.

199
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,480
This comes as a reward,

200
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,950
as well as the pressure for all of you.

201
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,520
If you’re defeated,

202
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,990
I’ll send you all to Disorienting Grand Canyon

203
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,450
for three-year cultivation.

204
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,930
<i>Disorienting Grand Canyon, a sinister place</i>

205
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,460
<i>where only ghosts can survive.</i>

206
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,690
<i>We must win this tournament.</i>

207
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,150
All right. You can go down now.

208
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,650
Yes.

209
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:59,840
Your Holiness, are you worrying?

210
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:03,140
Although they have the advantage over today,

211
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,260
in fact

212
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:08,200
the victory is still inclined to our side.

213
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,660
I’m not worried on Shrek Seven Devils.

214
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,020
They’re indeed talented,
but they’re still very young.

215
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,720
Their personal potentials
have not been fully explored yet.

216
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,330
Except Tang San, the others are
still ineligible to cause harm.

217
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:24,920
But their Grandmaster is distinct.
I’ve known him for many years.

218
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,620
I’ve never met someone
as wise as him in my lifetime.

219
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,250
The Seven in One Fusion Skill of
martial souls of different attributes

220
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,720
is the proof.

221
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,550
I admit that I’m incapable of
doing such a meticulous plan.

222
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,790
Are you worrying that

223
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,450
he’ll have any unusual plan
which may lead

224
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,950
to variables for tomorrow?

225
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:45,020
Why don’t I kill him now?

226
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,190
Even if Grand Venom Master is protecting them,

227
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:50,150
I still have 80% certainty
to kill him in one stroke.

228
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,090
Grandmaster, what should we do tomorrow?

229
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,690
Even if we can maintain
our optimum state for the battle,

230
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,350
the opponents’ soul powers
are much higher than ours.

231
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,350
They also have their Martial Soul Fusion Skill.

232
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,720
It’ll be really difficult for us to defeat them.

233
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,350
The difficulty is not absolute.

234
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,450
You’d start cultivating now.

235
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,090
I’ll carefully figure out
the tactics for tomorrow.

236
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,290
If you were that sure,

237
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:32,220
Tang San wouldn’t have arrived here alive.

238
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,550
Have you forgotten what our teacher
taught you in those years?

239
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:39,050
The effort is needed even for
the very tiny and easy matter.

240
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:43,520
Underestimating the enemy
is the greatest fear of the strategist.

241
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,520
Yes, Your Holiness.

242
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,350
If an Honourary Elder is being killed
casually in the Martial Soul Hall,

243
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,220
it’ll be a shame to Martial Soul Hall.

244
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,090
Moreover, he is from
Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon Tribe.

245
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,390
Please remember, without my order,

246
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,590
nobody is allowed to act against him hereafter.

247
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,520
Yes.

248
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:07,590
It’s late now. You may leave first.
Yes.

249
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:10,790
It’s late now. You may leave first.

250
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,990
Xiao Gang, you still surprised me a lot.

251
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:36,120
Did our teacher really tear us apart back then?

252
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:43,050
All I can do is to protect you.

253
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,220
But I couldn’t care so much

254
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,390
for the others.

255
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,690
[Next Episode]
Kids,

256
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:07,390
this is your last battle before graduation.

257
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,220
Honestly,

258
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,650
it’s my pleasure to cultivate all of you

259
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,920
into the great geniuses.

260
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,190
Nothing lasts forever.

261
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,520
Your future path

262
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,620
relies on your own.

263
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,320
I’ve told all of you that

264
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,650
I won’t let you graduate
unless you obtain the champion.

265
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,520
But I change my mind now.

266
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,390
I’ll never allow anyone of you
to be injured or died.

267
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,920
What I want is neither the victory

268
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,220
nor the champion,

269
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,450
I just want all of you to be safe and sound.
