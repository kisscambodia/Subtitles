35
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,790
What’s wrong? The sky has turned dark.

36
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,010
Not the sky, but our sight.

37
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,750
My body feels heavy and I can’t use my soul power.

<i>and all movements are lagged by 50%.</i>

45

Don’t act rashly.

46
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,680
This thick red mist

47
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,040
mixes with power containing
a sense of ruthlessness and hallucination.

48
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,730
Thus, people lose their sight

49
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,250

<i>This Martial Soul Fusion Skill is</i>

<i>par to the seventh soul skill
of ordinary soul masters.</i>

55

<i>Before Seven in One
Martial Soul Fusion Skill is exerted,</i>

56

<i>they’re engulfed by the red mist.</i>

57
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,190
<i>Shrek School has nothing to worry about.</i>

58
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,640
It’s too bad

59
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,610
to be trapped in the
Martial Soul Fusion Skill of their rivals.

60
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:59,640
Shrek Seven Devils’ soul power is inferior
to their opponents

61
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,800
Under such an adverse situation,

62
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,680

Xuan Yu Hand.

64
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,760
How do you know the direction of my attack?

65
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,070
Impossible. Ordinary soul masters

66
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,510
can’t identify directions in this red mist.

67
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,290
It’s impossible to escape when they’re trapped.

68
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:59,290
How strong Little Freak’s mental power is.

69
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,850
He can actually view in the red mist.

70
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,260
This must beyond Xie Yue’s expectation.

71
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,210
And Little San could reverse the situation

72
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,960
with his ability.

73
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,960
Do you think

74
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,220
you can escape from
our Martial Soul Fusian Skill?

75
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,740
This red mist perpetuates from
the center of Genie Mesmerize.

76
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,630
Genie Mesmerize stopped attacking me

77
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,960
when you’re out of it.

78
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,130
It speeds up

79
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,010
to bring the red mist along to spread it.

80
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,840
You’re right. Unless you can fly.

81
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,440
Otherwise, don’t think you can escape.

82
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,210
It’s impossible.

83
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,960
The world’s first martial soul of Support Branch

84
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,980
is really threatening.

85
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,900
I’ll settle you first.

86
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,120
Then, we’ll fly.

87
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,830
How could this happen?

88
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,430
Flight Mushroom Sausage had been used before.

89
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,730
Perhaps Martial Soul Hall thought
it was Little San’s flight ability.

90
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,080
So they have missed out Little Ao.

91
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,000
If there’s a focus in the vision,

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,600
the blind spot appears as well.

93
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,700
Neglecting a soul master from food branch

94
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,660
is their biggest mistake ever.

95
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,380
They did break out by flying.

96
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,360
By now, it’s useless

97
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,640
to hunt the six of them.

98
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,650
They may use the same way to escape.

99
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,580
Even though Martial Soul Fusion Skill is great,

100
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,600
but it depletes our soul power too.

101
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,860
For now,

102
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,190
the best way would be
depending on our members to settle them.

103
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,250
<i>Boss Dai, please settle yourselves.</i>

104
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,000
Do you think you can win

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,650
by escaping from Genie Mesmerize?

106
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,110
Don’t overestimate yourselves.

107
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,720
Shrek can never be comparable with

108
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,940
Martial Soul Hall Team

109
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,120
even without two of us.

110
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,180
You can never defeat two Soul Kings

111
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,010
when you’re just at Level 43.

112
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,180
This is

113
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,720
Soul bone?

114
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,380
<i>I never thought that Tang San
could hide his soul bone</i>

115
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,180
<i>throughout the whole tournament.</i>

116
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,350
<i>It looks like</i>

117
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:35,600
<i>a soul bone from a spider-typed soul beast.</i>

118
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,880
<i>How could this Soul Sect possess a soul bone?</i>

119
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,860
<i>The soul bone grows from his back.
Is it a torso bone?</i>

120
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,640
<i>It seems that we can’t settle him in a quick fight.</i>

121
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,190
<i>Although Tang San’s soul power
is weaker than us,</i>

122
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:54,410
<i>however, the presence of soul bone
will minimize this gap.</i>

123
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,250
<i>The Eight Spider Bone’s amplification</i>

124
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,230
<i>empowers me to retaliate the red mist.</i>

125
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,060
<i>The effect of Eight Spider Bone
on strength, agility, and toxicity</i>

126
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,640
<i>is robust.</i>

127
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,780
<i>I might be able to fight against them.</i>

128
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,200
<i>Advancing me with speed?</i>

129
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,300
<i>I saw you.</i>

130
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,320
<i>I must go near them.</i>

131
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,600
<i>Blue Silver Plant.</i>

132

<i>After absorbing two Human Faced Demon Spiders</i>

133
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,080
<i>and tempering by both
Octa Dark Frost and Fiery Soft Apricot,</i>

134
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,130
<i>Eight Spider Bone has become extremely tough.</i>

135
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,940
<i>But they had broken it.</i>

136
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,210
The attack of Moon Blade
is beyond my expectation.

137
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,770
The current situation
is different from what we perceived,

<i>My moves are slowing down
and my body is freezing.</i>

167
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,720
Fourth Soul Skill, Churning Lava.

168
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,480
Mu Bai!

169
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,260
Leave me and stay away.

170
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,870
Fourth Soul Skill, Blue Silver Cage.

171
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,880
Tang San, your soul power is weaker than mine.

172
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,950
How confident are you

173
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,760
to use the laborious fourth soul skill?

174
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,020
Hao Tian Hammer.

175
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,430
First Soul Skill, Arched Body,

176
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,940
<i>The weakest point of human</i>

177
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,380
<i>is at the lumbar spine.</i>

178
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,250
<i>Brother taught me this.</i>

179
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,330
Third Soul Skill, Teleport.

180
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,620
<i>We have got you.</i>

181
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,150
Fourth Soul Skill, Phoenix Strike.

182
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,220
Oh, no.

183
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:12,140
Sun Chuan Tao has lost.

184
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,060
Dai Mu Bai is also free from control.

185
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,060
It seems Shrek has got the upper hand.

186
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,120
But the situation in the red mist is unknown.

187
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,820
Can Tang San resist the attack of Genie Mesmerize?

188
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,700
<i>Even if I’m able to take the first Moon Blade,</i>

189
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,670
<i>but not the second one.</i>

190
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,800
Maybe...

191
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,230
Xuan Yu Hand.

192
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,880
Tang San, let’s see how you’re going
to take the second Moon Blade.

193
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,450
How could be this possible? A coincidence?

194
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,970
<i>Hidden Weapons of Tang Clan,
Kill Two Birds with One Stone.</i>

195
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,110
<i>In this world,</i>

196
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,940
<i>except me, no one knows this.</i>

197
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,740
<i>With a precise estimation of the strength
and angle of Hao Tian Hammer’s attack,</i>

198
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,190
<i>everything is within my control.</i>

199
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,240
<i>This is the essence of
Kill Two Birds with One Stone.</i>

200
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,970
If it’s not a coincidence,

201
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,980
His ability has gone far beyond my expectation.

202
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,550
But

203
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,720
I still have that stroke.

204
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,370
Tang San, you’re honored to fail

205
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,850
under my soul skill creation.

206
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:53,640
Feng Xiao Tian was
as arrogant as you when he used

207
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,440
Gale Devil Wolf
36 Successive Chops on me.

208
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,510
How dare you put Feng Xiao Tian on par with me?

209
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:01,720
My soul skill is flawless.

210
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,620
Tang San, taste it.

211
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,990
Full Moon.

212
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,170
<i>Xie Yue had used this skill</i>

213
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,880
<i>to defeat his teacher at Level 68.</i>

214
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,880
<i>Tang San, once Xie Yue uses the skill,</i>

215
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,550
<i>it means you have no way to stay alive.</i>

216
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,160
<i>Fourth Soul Skill, Blue Silver Cage.</i>

217
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,680
<i>It’s a matter of time for Moon Blade
to break Blue Silver Cage.</i>

218
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,340
<i>What’s more, this Full Moon.</i>

219
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:27,870
<i>What?</i>

220
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,160
<i>Break it instantly?</i>

221
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,360
<i>It’s powerful.</i>

222
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:35,380
<i>Xie Yue depletes his soul power
for Full Moon after using fusion skill,</i>

223
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,190
<i>this must be the final strike.</i>

224
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,320
<i>After this,</i>

225
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,000
<i>both of us</i>

226
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,240
<i>will deplete our soul power.</i>

227
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,360
<i>This is the decisive strike.</i>

228
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,920
[Next Episode]
I’ll never die here.

229
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,660
Brother!

230
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,600
Fifth Soul Skill,

231
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,550
Sand Storm Raging Fire.

232
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,390
What exactly is my real strength?

233
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,590
Do you know it?

234
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,320
That’s...

235
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,080
This is your soul skill creation?

236
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,320
Tang San.

237
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,570
Are you ready to lose?
