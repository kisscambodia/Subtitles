<i>by ten times more attackers than the defenders.</i>

59

<i>Once they can’t resist the enemy’s attack,</i>

67
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,840
<i>they can retreat to the second mountain
and chop it off</i>

68
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,420
<i>so, they will have time to buffer</i>

69
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,650
<i>and the second mountain will be the new barrier.</i>

70
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,050
Due to the low temperature,

71
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,060
the frozen iron chain has turned
brittle and slippery. Be careful.

every day

164
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,110
and going to spend
the rest of his life like this.

165
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,540
Accompanying your mom?

166
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,850
After she died,
she turned into the Blue Silver Plant.

167
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,240
She...

168
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:37,760
Well...

169
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,670
Perhaps this is the best for him.

170
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,310
Tribe Chief,
this is what Father asked me to bring here.

171
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:51,020
He said this is the only thing
he could do for the tribe.

172
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,670
Brother Hao...

173
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,020
Father said if he didn’t do this,

174
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,160
he couldn’t stay with Mom in peace.

175
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,720
Tribe Chief, you don’t have to...

176
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,560
Call me Uncle.

177
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,350
Uncle.

178
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:16,680
To be honest,
I’ve never thought that he was wrong.

179
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:20,720
If Ah Yin had chosen me,

180
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,030
I would have done the exact same thing as he did.

181
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,720
Uncle.

182
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,910
No matter what others say hereafter,

183
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:34,800
I don’t wish to see
his past become your burden.

184
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,170
Serving the tribe is your responsibility,

185
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:42,350
because you’re part of it.

186
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,650
Thank you, Uncle.

187
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,210
Yue Hua, hold a ceremony tomorrow
to acknowledge him back to the tribe.

188
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,360
Please arrange it.

189
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,830
What about those tribe elders?

190
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:56,880
Rather than notify them privately,
it’d be better make it public.

191
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,090
It has been some time since
Hao Tian Tribe last held a grand ceremony.

192
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,130
This young man must
have some connection.

193
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,360
- I heard that the Five Elders...
- Maybe they refuse to see him.

194
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,540
He’s coming.

195
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,120
He looks mundane.

196
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,080
He looks so weak.
How dare he come to our tribe?

197
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,790
There are four generations of
immediate family in the tribe.

198
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,840
We belong to the third generation,
about 200 people in total.

199
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,340
Only part of them come today.

200
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,480
The others are training at the front yard.

201
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,560
Now, the situation in the tribe is complex.

202
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,950
Viewing from your father’s point,

203
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,270
the tribe has separated into two parties.

204
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,200
The one led by your uncle

205
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,910
reckons that it wasn’t your dad’s fault,

206
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,930
but the overbearing Martial Soul Hall,

207
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:53,310
while the other, which is led by
the tribe elders from the first generation,

208
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:56,110
thinks that the conflict was caused

209
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,170
by the matrimony of your dad and the soul beast.

210
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:02,200
Besides, he infuriated your grandpa
on his deathbed, which is unforgivable.

211
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,340
Our tribe is hiding all because of him.
How dare he come back?

212
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,480
Aunt, do you mean that

213
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,190
the tribe elders will prevent me
from coming back?

214
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,880
All the tribe elders are powerful.

215
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,400
They are tough and stubborn personality, and...

216
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:45,100
The worst result will be that

217
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,500
you are expelled from the tribe
and your martial soul eradicated.

218
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,780
Since you allow me to come back,

219
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,750
you have figured out a countermeasure, right?

220
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,760
My advice to you is

221
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,650
to be tough.

222
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:04,240
One’s power speaks for him here.

223
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,350
Why is it so cold suddenly?

224

I refuse to hear

235
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,570
anything about this man.

236
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,560
Only this news

237
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:25,000
you all must listen to, Tribe Elders.

238
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,240
We’ll let you try then.

239
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,520
It’s over.

240
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,140
Random Air Hammer Skill.

241
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,830
His soul power is way higher than mine.

242
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,500
Besides, he’s only using
the third soul skill.

243
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,280
But

244
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,990
Tang San only discretely gives
his opponent small cuts every time.

245
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,630
Releasing the poison bit by bit

246
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,790
is the way least likely to be noticed.
