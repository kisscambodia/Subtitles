[Previous episode]

31
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,080
The Martial Soul Main Hall and its people

32
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,580
were destroyed overnight.

33
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,480
Nothing like this has ever happened

34
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,280
in the Douluo Continent.

35
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,110
This is called carrying out justice for god.

36
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,880
The Seven Clans Re-selection Contest

37
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,950
is around the corner.

38
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,010
We must accelerate

39
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,010
the development of Tang Clan.

40
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:25,850
Clan Chief.

41
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,010
Take a look

42
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,680
at what we’ve done while you were gone.

43
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,080
You finished all these constructions

44
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,810
in such a short time.

45
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,350
I have a suggestion.

46
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,580
I’d like to change the four tribes

47
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,650
into four halls.

48
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,850
Each elder will be a leader of one hall.

49
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,480
Send my orders.

50
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,050
We will execute the plan earlier.

[Episode 152]

52
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,820
Is that all you can do?

53
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,300
Sorry, my lord.

54
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,710
He’s so handsome.

55
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,710
Boss Fu.

56
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,210
You’re being irresponsible again?

57
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,550
There are so few students this year,

58
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,380
and you’re not going to do anything?

59
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,050
It’s not that I don’t want to.

60
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,279
The Martial Soul Hall

61
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:21,249
recently reorganized multiple
Advanced Soul Master Schools.

62
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,910
Many young soul masters have joined them.

63
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,510
If it wasn’t for our existing popularity,

64
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,510
the situation would be even worse.

65
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,580
After soul masters finish studying,

66
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,710
they still need to find a career.

67
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,710
-Teacher!
-they still need to find a career.

68
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,350
Hong Jun.

69
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,310
Little San.

70
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,260
You came back just in time.

71
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,620
We are talking about soul masters.

72
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,828
How is Tang Clan going?

73
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,445
Everything is ready.

74
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,900
The clan is ready to start operating.

75
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,510
Next,

76
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,810
after we produce a number of

77
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,510
our hidden weapons,

78
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,710
the clan

79
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,910
will be officially established.

80
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,710
If you need any help from the school,

81
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,750
just say so.

82
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,750
The graduation exam is in half a month.

83
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,510
At that time, I will pick some talented students

84
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,250
with good nature and refer them to you

85
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,550
to join Tang Clan.

86
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,550
I hope your Tang Clan

87
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,280
will be a new option for soul masters in the future.

89
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,950
<i>have been doing preparations to help us.</i>

90
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:18,980
Teacher.

91
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,480
Thank you.

92
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:25,810
Oh right, Dean.

93
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,150
While we were gone,

94
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,450
did anything happen

95
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,710
at Shrek School?

96
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,680
How is the School of Four Elements?

97
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,280
Don’t worry.

98
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,750
Everything is well with Shrek School.

99
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,680
The School of Four Elements

100
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,780
has also joined our school as well.

101
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,480
If we’re talking about power,

102
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,710
Shrek School

103
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,180
is definitely the top

104
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,680
over the continent.

105
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,650
What?

106
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,280
The School of Four Elements

107
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,950
joined Shrek School?

108
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,510
The School of Four Elements

109
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,010
is nothing to be afraid of.

110
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:58,850
I mean,

111
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,850
are we afraid that they will harm our interest

112
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:01,980
in Tian Dou City?

113
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,980
But it’s also because
they’re dealing with a profiteer like you.

114
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,810
Will an evil businessman be disadvantaged

115
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,080
when negotiating conditions with them?

116
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,850
The School of Four Elements

117
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,750
was scared by Grand Bone Master
and Grand Venom Master.

118
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,480
<i>[Unfair Treaty]</i>

119
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,310
They definitely wouldn’t disagree

120
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,250
with two Grand Soul Land Masters.

121
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,650
Senior Dugu Bo was here?

122
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,550
He came for you.

123
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,950
It seemed urgent.

124
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,710
He probably ran into some trouble

125
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,550
and left without staying for long.

126
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,750
What would make that Old Freak be in such a rush?

127
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,180
Could it be...

128
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,610
Not too long ago,

129
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,950
Prince Xue Xing asked me to diagnose
and treat Emperor Xue Ye.

130
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,050
I found

131
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,450
that Emperor Xue Ye was poisoned
with a mixed poison.

132
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,880
The cause

133
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,510
was a type of spice in his food.

134
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,350
In the palace,

135
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:03,050
only Xue Qing He uses that spice.

136
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,280
The Ning family’s little girl
said that Little Freak is back!

137
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,250
Frander.

138
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,310
Is he here?

139
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,010
Little Freak.

140
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,580
Emperor Xue Ye is about to die.

141
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,450
What?

142
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,310
Old Freak.

143
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,050
Didn’t you tell me last time

144
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,180
that Emperor Xue Ye’s poison

145
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,450
was under control?

146
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,910
I did have it under control then.

147
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,780
But who would’ve thought

148
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,910
that he would become

149
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,050
suddenly poisoned again,

150
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,580
and the situation is even worse this time.

151
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,550
What antidote did you use?

152
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,450
I used Jade Phosphor Serpent King Venom,

153
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,110
attacking his poison with more poison

154
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,110
to neutralize the mixed poison.

155
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,780
I then used medicine to nurse his health.

156
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,210
But every time I neutralized it,

157
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,310
there would be new poison not long after.

158
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,680
I’ve calculated it carefully.

159
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,680
After neutralizing seven times,

160
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,050
he will die once he is poisoned again.

161
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,610
How many times have you neutralized it already?

162
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,610
Six.

163
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,350
The time between each relapse
is also getting shorter.

164
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,050
If Emperor Xue Ye

165
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,410
is not poisoned with a simple mixed poison,

166
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,010
but a more complicated one,

167
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,410
then we’ll be in big trouble.

168
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,510
Hurry and come with me to the palace.

169
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,050
If you can’t even do anything,

170
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,110
then Tian Dou Empire is really doomed!

171
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,750
Wait.

172
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,010
We need to find someone first

173
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,010
and take him along.

174
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:17,710
What?

175
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,910
You know someone else that’s good at using poison?

176
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,450
Let’s go.

177
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,250
I’ll tell you on the way.

178
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:24,310
Teacher.

179
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:24,810
Dean.

180
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:25,880
We’ll leave first.

181
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,710
Fatty.

182
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,480
You stay here

183
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,550
and wait for Rong Rong and Little Ao.

184
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,410
If things really change in Tian Dou Empire,

185
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,050
then our plan

186
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,050
also has to be changed.

187
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,450
All of the symptoms you described

188
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,980
are signs of multiple mixed poisons.

189
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,880
If we can’t find the root of the cause,

190
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,650
we won’t be able to find a cure.

191
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,880
<i>It seems like this person’s knowledge of poison</i>

192
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,880
<i>is no less than mine.</i>

193
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,280
Can you make an antidote?

194
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,880
As long as we can find the root of the poison,

195
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,110
I am fairly confident.

196
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,680
That’s great.

[Soul Land]

198

Out of the way.

199

We have urgent matters to report to His Majesty.

200
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:05,165
His Majesty is resting.

201
00:11:05,335 --> 00:11:06,735
The Crown Prince has ordered

202
00:11:06,735 --> 00:11:08,795
that no one is allowed to enter.

203
00:11:09,265 --> 00:11:10,095
Anyone who disobeys

204
00:11:10,265 --> 00:11:11,235
will be killed.

205
00:11:15,295 --> 00:11:18,195
Do you not see the gold medal in my hand?

206
00:11:28,635 --> 00:11:30,235
This is the Crown Prince’s gold medal.

207
00:11:30,495 --> 00:11:31,665
How is this possible?

208
00:11:32,035 --> 00:11:33,135
The situation has changed.

209
00:11:33,135 --> 00:11:34,495
The Crown Prince has changed his mind.

210
00:11:34,495 --> 00:11:35,865
Hurry and let us in.

211
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:46,935
Have you seen those royal guards before?

212
00:11:46,935 --> 00:11:47,865
No.

213
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:52,935
<i>Teacher didn’t tell me</i>

214
00:11:52,935 --> 00:11:54,635
<i>about the royal soul masters being redeployed.</i>

215
00:11:54,635 --> 00:11:56,365
<i>The entire palace</i>

216
00:11:56,535 --> 00:11:58,465
<i>must be locked down by Xue Qing He.</i>

217
00:12:58,735 --> 00:13:00,665
<i>Old Freak is so frightened.</i>

218
00:13:00,665 --> 00:13:02,665
<i>These two people must have a higher level</i>

219
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:04,265
<i>of soul power than him.</i>

220
00:13:04,265 --> 00:13:06,835
It turns out Tang Yin is Tang San.

221
00:13:07,235 --> 00:13:08,835
I made a mistake

222
00:13:08,835 --> 00:13:10,435
when we were in the Moon Pavilion.

223
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:14,365
Brother Tang San.

224
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:17,465
Why didn’t let them tell me you were here?

225
00:13:18,335 --> 00:13:20,235
I could’ve welcomed you.

226
00:13:20,235 --> 00:13:22,095
Xue Ke keeps talking about you.

227
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,065
Greetings, Crown Prince.

228
00:13:30,795 --> 00:13:32,095
Crown Prince.

229
00:13:32,095 --> 00:13:32,865
Greetings.

230
00:13:37,765 --> 00:13:39,195
Thank you for your kindness,

231
00:13:39,195 --> 00:13:40,535
Crown Prince.

232
00:13:41,095 --> 00:13:42,235
I was invited

233
00:13:42,235 --> 00:13:43,695
by Senior Dugu Bo

234
00:13:43,695 --> 00:13:45,065
to treat His Majesty.

235
00:13:45,065 --> 00:13:46,835
Will you let us in first

236
00:13:46,835 --> 00:13:48,065
to treat His Majesty?

237
00:13:48,365 --> 00:13:50,665
No need to worry about my father, brother.

238
00:13:50,665 --> 00:13:52,665
It’s not easy for you to come to the palace.

239
00:13:53,135 --> 00:13:54,665
Let me treat you to a meal

240
00:13:54,665 --> 00:13:56,665
and we can have a chat.

241
00:13:57,235 --> 00:13:58,265
It seems like

242
00:13:58,265 --> 00:13:59,635
all the guards here

243
00:13:59,635 --> 00:14:01,895
are from the Martial Soul Hall.

244
00:14:02,195 --> 00:14:03,835
Right, Crown Prince?

245
00:14:04,735 --> 00:14:05,765
Tang San.

246
00:14:05,765 --> 00:14:07,335
What nonsense is that?

247
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:10,835
This is the Tian Dou Empire Palace.

248
00:14:11,265 --> 00:14:12,835
Why would people
from the Martial Soul Hall be here?

249
00:14:12,835 --> 00:14:14,235
Crown Prince.

250
00:14:14,235 --> 00:14:16,035
You still slipped up.

251
00:14:16,035 --> 00:14:17,235
The two people next to you

252
00:14:17,235 --> 00:14:18,665
must be Grand Soul Land Masters, right?

253
00:14:18,665 --> 00:14:20,665
Why aren’t they with Emperor Xue Ye, protecting him,

254
00:14:20,665 --> 00:14:22,135
but with you instead?

255
00:14:22,365 --> 00:14:23,665
Besides, there are only a limited number

256
00:14:23,665 --> 00:14:25,435
of Grand Masters in the entire continent.

257
00:14:25,435 --> 00:14:26,695
Besides the Martial Soul Hall,

258
00:14:26,695 --> 00:14:28,295
who has this kind of power?

259
00:14:28,465 --> 00:14:29,595
Second,

260
00:14:30,395 --> 00:14:31,865
did you really replace all the royal guards

261
00:14:31,865 --> 00:14:33,565
with soul masters

262
00:14:33,835 --> 00:14:35,765
just to protect His Majesty?

263
00:14:36,665 --> 00:14:38,765
If so, why didn’t you tell the Chief of Soul Masters,

264
00:14:39,035 --> 00:14:40,595
who is also my teacher?

265
00:14:41,135 --> 00:14:42,065
Third,

266
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:45,235
you knew my real identity as soon as you saw me.

267
00:14:45,495 --> 00:14:46,965
But you didn’t question

268
00:14:46,965 --> 00:14:48,595
the medal I had at all.

269
00:14:49,265 --> 00:14:50,595
I’m positive that you are close

270
00:14:50,895 --> 00:14:53,165
with the Martial Soul Hall.

271
00:14:53,735 --> 00:14:56,735
You learned from them that Tang Yin is Tang San.

272
00:14:57,095 --> 00:14:58,335
Crown Prince.

273
00:14:58,335 --> 00:14:59,535
I think

274
00:14:59,535 --> 00:15:02,165
my thought is mostly correct.

275
00:15:05,135 --> 00:15:07,865
No wonder you’re the core of the Shrek Seven Devils.

276
00:15:08,235 --> 00:15:10,095
You could guess all that

277
00:15:10,095 --> 00:15:12,095
from just a few clues.

278
00:15:13,195 --> 00:15:16,735
But how can you prove you right?

279
00:15:16,965 --> 00:15:18,035
That’s easy.

280
00:15:18,535 --> 00:15:20,395
As long as you let us see His Majesty,

281
00:15:20,395 --> 00:15:22,495
everything will prove itself.

282
00:15:22,835 --> 00:15:23,795
But

283
00:15:24,935 --> 00:15:26,735
you won’t let us

284
00:15:26,735 --> 00:15:27,795
ruin your plan, will you?

285
00:15:30,365 --> 00:15:31,195
Very good.

286
00:15:31,195 --> 00:15:32,395
You guessed correctly.

287
00:15:32,535 --> 00:15:35,095
I did borrow power
from the Martial Soul Hall this time.

288
00:15:35,595 --> 00:15:38,065
But the palace is under internal
and external threats

289
00:15:38,665 --> 00:15:41,395
and I have no other choice.

290
00:15:41,665 --> 00:15:42,635
Tang San.

291

I need you to help me build Tian Dou Empire.

298

Xue Qing He.

299
00:15:57,065 --> 00:15:58,435
Do you think that I would follow

300
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:00,235
a traitor who kills his own father and ruler?

301
00:16:01,735 --> 00:16:03,135

302

You’re so smart.

303
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,135
But don’t you understand?

304
00:16:07,135 --> 00:16:09,235
You have revealed all my plans.

305
00:16:09,995 --> 00:16:12,695
I definitely won’t let you go.

306
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:17,435
Why bother?

307
00:16:17,765 --> 00:16:19,095
People like you

308
00:16:19,095 --> 00:16:20,165

309
00:16:20,165 --> 00:16:21,635
what I’m doing.

Tang San.

356
00:20:44,268 --> 00:20:46,068
Even if you fire off the signal flare,

357
00:20:46,068 --> 00:20:47,668
no one will come to rescue you.

358
00:20:47,668 --> 00:20:49,528
As long as you surrender,

359
00:20:49,528 --> 00:20:51,928
I can accept this condition.

360
00:20:51,928 --> 00:20:54,598
I’m going to give you one last chance.

361
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,328
Are you going to surrender

362
00:20:56,728 --> 00:20:58,068
or to be destroyed?

363
00:20:58,568 --> 00:21:00,168
Dugu Bo!

364
00:21:00,428 --> 00:21:03,298
Hurry and become my nourishment!

365
00:21:03,298 --> 00:21:05,328
But I need to live.

366
00:21:05,328 --> 00:21:06,798
As long as you seek revenge for me

367
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:08,298
and destroy the Martial Soul Hall,

368
00:21:08,298 --> 00:21:09,428
submitting myself to you

369
00:21:09,428 --> 00:21:10,628
is not a problem.

370
00:21:10,628 --> 00:21:11,868
Great.
