It’s not that I’m not willing to let you eat it.

is not easy to deal with.

This is a meeting of our Four Tribes.

I hope to see no outsiders here.

104
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,950

105
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,520
to discuss with you.

106
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,250
Old Goat.

107
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,950
Why are you still the same?

108
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,950
A man brought here by Old Gorilla

109
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,350
must be no outsider.

110
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,380
Alright.

111
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,280
You’re the host.

112
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,850
Even you don’t mind it.

113
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:56,750
Why would I mind?

114
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,550
Let him stay, then.

115
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,720
Old Goat.

116
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,620
Everyone’s here.

117
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,050
Why do you

118
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,820
still look so gloomy?

119
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,250
It’s all because of the Martial Soul Hall.

120
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,180
They are crossing the line.

121
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,820
The Elephant Armoured Tribe even came

122
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,380
and asked me to join their tribe.

123
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,550
Or else,

124
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,550
they would demolish my Tribe of Destruction.

125
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,820
Old Gorilla.

126
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,180
Old Rhino.

127
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,550
Old White Bird.

128
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,680
If you treat me as your brother,

129
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,480
let us be united

130
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,450
and form a clan

131
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,680
to fight the Martial Soul Hall.

132
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,320
We shall let them know
that the four single attribute tribes

133
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,980
are not so easy to bully.

134
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,580
Why?

135
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,620
Are you afraid?

136
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,120
If our Four Tribes join hands,

137
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,820
we will have almost 1,000 soul masters.

138
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,020
We won’t be weaker

139
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,120
than any of the Lower Four.

140
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,020
Old Goat.

141
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,250
Were you humiliated?

142
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,620
You’re not so impulsive normally.

143
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,180
Humiliated?

144
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,820
I was not only humiliated...

145
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,680
If we don’t take action,

146
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,080
you won’t see me next year.

147
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,850
Old Goat.

148
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,780
Seems like we are

149
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,580
having the same idea.

150
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,620
Now, the Martial Soul Hall is
getting more powerful.

151
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,580
I’m afraid that it will be hard

152
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,970
for a single tribe to survive.

153
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,540
So, in this meeting,

154
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,270
I wanted to discuss

155
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,780
the matter of forming a clan.

156
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,420
That is just right.

157
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,180
I’ve planned it all.

158
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,950
If we want to form a clan,

159
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,050
we shall move to the capital of Xing Luo Empire.

160
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,120
Martial Soul Hall’s power there is not so strong.

161
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,980
The Tribe of Destruction has some savings.

162
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,680
In a short period of time,

163
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,150
we have no problem supporting our livings.

164
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,020
Old Goat.

165
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,020
I don’t think Xing Luo Empire

166
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,250
is a good choice.

167
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,750
Why?

168
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,280
We are not familiar

169
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,820
with the capital of Xing Luo Empire.

170
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,280
None of us have stayed there for a long time.

171
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,750
Old Rhino, Old White Bird and I have discussed it.

172
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,420
We are planning to move to Tian Dou City.

173
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,450
It’s not a problem

174
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,920
to move to your place.

175
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,220
But,

176
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,220
our Tribe of Destruction’s business is

177
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,880
in Xing Luo Empire.

178
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,380
If we move to Tian Dou Empire,

179
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,820
we will have to start over again.

180
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,580
Don’t worry.

181
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,620
It’s not a problem in supporting everyone.

182
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,950
With your Tribe of Strength’s
financial ability alone,

183
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,380
it might be hard to support everyone.

184
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,680
The clan we’ve planned to form

185
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,420
is called Tang Clan.

186
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:57,850
I just wanted

187
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,680
to introduce to you the Chief.

188
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,050
But you were ignoring him.

189
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,650
He’s the Chief?

190
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,520
This immature guy?

191
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,420

193

It’s extremely urgent for me now.

194
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,850
Stop joking with me.

195
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,750
Old Goat.

196
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,020
Who joked with you?

197
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,480
Tang San is not only the chief of Tang Clan,

198
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,520
he’s also the son of our master.

199
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,120
What?

200
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:56,880
[Soul Land]

201
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,420
He is Tang Hao’s son?

202
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,780
Yes.

203
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,780
Old Goat.

204
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,080
What are you doing?

205
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,250
You’ve all yielded to Hao Tian Tribe.

206
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,520
What can I say?

207
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,250
I don’t belong here.

208
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:13,980
I’ll leave.

209
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,250
Treat it as if I didn’t come here today.

210
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,850
Don’t be reckless.

211
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,520
Don’t you believe us,

212
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,750
your old brothers?

213
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,550
I can stay.

214
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,750
Kick Tang San out first.

215
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:26,820
And,

216
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,580
don’t mention Tang Clan in front of me.

217
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,650
This...

218
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,820
Senior Yang Wu Di.

219
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,920
Can I say something?

220
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,250
I swore

221
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,980
Hao Tian Tribe would be my enemy forever.

222
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,920
Get out when I can still hold my temper.

223
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:44,450
Or else,

224
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,650
don’t blame me for killing you.

225
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,620

226
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,980
Excuse me.

227
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,220
I would like to see how Senior Yang Wu Di

228

can kill me.

229
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,820
Even an immature kid

230
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,150
dares to yell in front of me!

231

233

I won’t kill him outright.

234
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,980

235

Why don’t we make a bet?

238
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,180
Do you even deserve to make a bet with me?

239
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,680
We bet on how many rounds you can
survive under my attack?

240

No.

241
