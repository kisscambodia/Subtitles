My real name

is Qian Ren Xue.

33
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,750
As long as you come
from the Martial Soul Hall,

34
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,250
you are my enemy!

35

Tan San.

36
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,010
Goodbye.

37

[Episode 155]

40
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,280
Who is it?

41
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,310
Senior Dugu,

42
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,050
you’re finally here!

43
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,450
I’ve been with Father all this time,

44
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,980
in case my brother hurts him again.

45
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,110
The poison has taken effect.

46
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,580
At most, he can last for half an hour.

47
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,180
He is severely intoxicated.

48
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,250
The medication I have with me

49
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,410
isn’t effective for that.

50
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,310
It’s a mixed poison made up
of seven different poisons.

51
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,280
No wonder even I couldn’t find the antidote.

52
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,320
I can make the antidote,

53
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,720
but I need time.

54
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:47,580
Old Freak.

55
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,150
How long can he live

56
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,510
if we fight poison with poison?

57
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,450
At least twenty-four hours.

58
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,880
But if we still can’t rescue him,

59
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,450
he will die for sure.

60

How is the school?

63
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,950
Once we defeated the enemy,

64
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,750
we immediately came here to meet you,

65
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,110
and saw people from the Qibao Amber Tribe

66
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,150
and Tang Clan

67
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,750
fighting with the imperial soul masters.

68
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,050
We snuck in under the cover of the chaos.

69
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,780
The power of Tang Clan

70
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,910
is what the Martial Soul Hall overlooked.

71
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,550
Let’s go back to the school first.

72
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,150
We can only start our counterattack

73
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,950
after we get the support of Emperor Xue Ye.

74
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,710
The palace is heavily guarded.

75
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,080

the Qibao Amber Tribe and Tang Clan

77
