Standing tall and magnificent.

It’s worthy of its name, the top tribe of the world.

Be careful, everyone.

Don’t go, Tang San.

00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,720
<i>The pressure is denser than Uncle’s.
I can’t resist anymore.</i>

41
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,970
Greetings to you, Tribe Elders.

42
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,150
Death God Domain.

43
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,520
It is.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,410
You’ve inherited
Tang Hao’s talent though.

45
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,970
What’s so great about the talent?

46
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,210
If there’s another one
behaving like Tang Hao,

47
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,320
the tribe will collapse, I’m afraid.

48
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,410
Kneel down, bastard.

49
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,140
Return to the tribe this time,

50
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:52,750
I am to atone for my father and
to help the tribe regain its glory.

51
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,950
Please accord me to acknowledge
my ancestors, Tribe Chief and Tribe Elders.

52
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,140
Absurd. Never even think about it

53
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,350
after what your father have done.

54
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:07,630
What’s worst is that you’re a bastard of him and the evil beast.

55
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,990
Mind your words, Seventh Brother.

56
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,360
Who are you calling bastard?

57
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:23,020
You, exactly. If it wasn’t for Tang Hao,

58
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,360
my son wouldn’t have been killed by
Martial Soul Hall.

59
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,640
Tang Hao has been reckless since young,

60
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,050
he never considers the safety of
the entire family something important.

61
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,890
He’s indeed a troublemaker.

62
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,100
Nonsense. Brother Hao is not.

63
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,830
He doesn’t deserve to be
the disciple of Hao Tian Tribe.

64
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,880
Tang Hao has to be expelled from the tribe
to save us all.

65
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,360
You’re right. We can’t afford
to offend Martial Soul Hall.

66
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:23,280
Tang Hao has to be expelled. Expel him!

67
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,320
No. No way!

68
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,320
Hand over Tang Hao.

69
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,070
Does he dare to duel with the Tribe Elders?

70
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,360
I’m sorry, Seventh Elder.

71
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,540
I apologise to you on behalf of my father.

72
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,910
However, your real enemy
should be Martial Soul Hall,

73
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,890
not Father or me.

74
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,180
It’s Father’s fault to get the tribe into trouble.
And I’ve apologized to you for that.

75
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,580
But, you’ve humiliated my mom.

76
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,120
I must get the justice back.

77
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,960
Seventh Elder, I challenge you.
I’ll never regret even if I die.

78
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,290
My advice to you is to be tough.

79
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,910
Is he insane?

80
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,610
How dare you, a junior, challenge me?

81
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,400
<i>It seems that Elder Brother wants to
take this chance to test Tang San again.</i>

82
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,870
Don’t you dare?

83
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,870
Brat...

84
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:17,000
It’s good for young people
to have pride, but not arrogance.

85
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,980
You despise the tribe,
we won’t let you off easily.

86
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,320
Where’s Tang Hu?

87
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,640
Second Uncle.

88
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:32,090
Have a fight with him.
Although Hao Tian Tribe had gone into hiding,

89
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,950
but we never allow provocation.

90
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,520
<i>Be careful, Tang San. Although I’m the
strongest amongst the third generation,</i>

91
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,020
<i>Tang Hu isn’t no way inferior than me.</i>

92
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,760
Elder, if I win,

93
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,510
am I eligible to challenge
Seventh Elder?

94
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,840
Yes.

95
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,670
Tang Hu, if you lose,
I’ll lock you up for a year.

96
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:15,720
Tang Hu, Soul Emperor Level 64
from Storm Attack Branch.

97
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:21,500
Tang San, Soul King Level 59
from Controlling Branch.

98
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,980
He is on Level 59?

99
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:32,480
Such a cocky young man.
How dare he bluff before the Elders?

100
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,880
<i>Previously, Tang Hao</i>

101
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,220
<i>has been considered as
the rare talent of Hao Tian Tribe.</i>

102
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:45,370
<i>His son is more outstanding than him.</i>

103
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,150
Start.

104
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,460
Since Tang Hu has one more
soul ring than Tang San,

105
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:57,080
I don’t think he can make up the gap
with just a Death God Domain.

106
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,090
Blue Silver Plant? Such a lame martial soul?

107
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,500
How ridiculous!
He wants to join the tribe

108
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,550
without the martial soul of
Hao Tian Hammer?

109
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,980
Seventh Brother.

110
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:31,440
If I’m not wrong, he must have twin martial souls.

111
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,800
Yes. A rare twin martial souls.

112
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,560
Twin martial souls plus Death God Domain,

113
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,950
he does have that in him to be arrogant.

114
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,000
Continue.

115
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,760
Watch out. The fourth soul skill.

116
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,500
Blue Silver Cage.

117
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,230
<i>He’s so powerful.</i>

118
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,070
The third soul skill.

119
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,080
Vigorous Strike.

120
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,960
<i>This strike weighs more than a ton.</i>

121
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,120
<i>Why is the cage not broken?</i>

122
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,880
<i>His soul power is much higher than mine.</i>

123
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,560
<i>Besides, he’s only using
the third soul skill.</i>

124
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,120
<i>It’s only a matter of time for him to break
Blue Silver Cage.</i>

125
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,890
<i>Then I’ll let you have a taste of...</i>

126
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,880
What’s this?

127
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,740
As the colour of the martial soul is changing,

128
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,920
it’s clearly that the power is soaring.

129
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,930
It’s the mutating of the martial soul
caused by the innate domain.

130
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,920
<i>No, it isn’t a mutated martial soul.</i>

131
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:16,680
[Soul Land]

132
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,080
<i>Since Little San has inherited
Ah Yin’s Blue Silver Emperor,</i>

133
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,880
<i>he must have carried on the uniqueness of it.</i>

134
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,900
Fifth soul skill...

135
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,790
<i>Such destructive pressure.</i>

<i>I can’t let him perform this soul skill.</i>

137

Fifth Soul Skill,

138
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,650
Man and Hammer Union.

139
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,950
<i>Tang San has taken a long time to accumulate
power for this skill.</i>

140
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,430
<i>Since it requires such a longer time to do so,</i>

141
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,870
<i>why does he have to use this skill then?</i>

142
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,280
<i>There’re only
two possible reasons for this.</i>

143
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,880
<i>Firstly, this skill must be
extremely powerful.</i>

144
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,070
<i>It’s strong enough to resist a head-on strike
and simultaneously take down the rival.</i>

145
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,080
<i>And secondly...</i>

146
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,360
It’s over. Random Air Hammer Skill.

147
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,880
<i>This shows that he wasn’t raised in the tribe.</i>

148
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,030
<i>How dare he encounter directly
at such a critical moment?</i>

149
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,020
Second Soul Skill.

Parasite.

151
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,210
<i>And secondly...</i>

152
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:49,840
<i>he purposely extends the time of
accumulating power...</i>

153
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,470
<i>to induce his rival to think that there’s a flaw.</i>

154
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,900
<i>I must win this duel.</i>

155
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,690
Sixth soul skill...

156
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,330
Third Soul Skill,

157
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,850
Constraint of Spider Web.

158
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,300
<i>Other soul skills of mine
don’t take time to accumulate power.</i>

159
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,080
How could it be?
With Tang Hu’s ability,

160
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,830
he should be able
to break through the control.

161
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:11,180
<i>What makes Tang Hu
unable to resist is poison, actually.</i>

162
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:15,120
<i>Tang San merely attacks
his rival discretely every time.</i>

163
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,980
<i>Penetrating the poison into his rival bit by bit
is hardly noticeable.</i>

164
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,250
Fifth Soul Skill,

165
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,170
Blue Silver Emperor Tyrant Spear.

166
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,540
<i>Can’t break it.
I could only take this blow.</i>

167
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,690
<i>This strike is so powerful.</i>

168
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:11,080
<i>If it was me, could I take it?</i>

169
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,680
I’ve lost.

170
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,660
Thank you for letting me win.

171
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:23,160
I wonder if I could challenge
Seventh Elder now?

172
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,860
No matter what soul skills I’m gonna use,

173
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,770
I’ll use only 30% of my strength.

174
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,700
I’m less consumed than you think.

175
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,280
Besides, I’ll be using my soul bone.

176
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,940
Please use 10% more.

177
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,630
Soul bone?

178
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,330
Not necessary.

179
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,960
If you think I’m taking advantage of you,

180
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,410
I’ll choose the battle location then.
Agree?

181
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,160
Sure.

182
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,210
On the iron chain bridge then.

183
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,360
Seventh Elder, if you lose,

184
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,080
I hope you take back
your words which insult my mom

185
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,430
and agree upon my acknowledgment
towards the ancestors. Deal?

186
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,190
But if you lose,

187
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:13,400
you’ll be imprisoned here forever

188
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,040
as a sinner of Hao Tian Tribe.

189
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:20,760
Seventh Elder,
this’s not for you to decide.

190
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,690
What do you think, Tribe Chief?

191
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,840
If Tang San wins the battle,

192
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,150
please stop obstructing him.

193
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,200
But if he lose...

194
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,330
What?

195
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,830
he’ll have to leave the tribe.

196
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:42,600
He can never use Hao Tian Hammer
for the rest of his life.

197
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,770
Isn’t this too easy?

198
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,680
Imprisoning him here forever

199
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,030
means that he’ll end up here.

200
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:56,640
Are you willing to see
such a gifted person falls?

201
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:04,460
No matter what, in his veins
flows the blood of Hao Tian Tribe.

202
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,080
Nothing can ever change this fact.

203
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,040
Well, I agree.

204
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,960
If Tang San wins over
Seventh Elder,

205
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,960
I have three additional requests.

206
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:23,319
Of course, I’ll tell him
after he acknowledges the ancestors.

207
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:26,759
He can decide whether to agree or not.

208
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,840
<i>Although there’re conflicting opinions
between my uncle and the Tribe Elders,</i>

209
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,920
<i>but it seems like they’re all working
for the tribe’s sake.</i>

210
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,440
Well, if so. Please proceed.

211
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:43,130
Next, there’s something about Tang Hao

212
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:46,270
that I’d like to invite all Tribe Elders to witness.

213
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:49,320
I refuse to hear anything about him.

214
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,800
Tribe Elders, only this news...

215
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,410
you all must listen.

After reborning,

227
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,940
I still can’t escape from the same fate.

228
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,430
But in this life,
I’ll take control of my own destiny.
