go now?

101
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,840
No.

107
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,810

Actually,

109
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,080
I don’t really hate you.

110
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,210
Come on!

111
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,130
Just go!

113

I can’t defeat you

115
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,580
You’re still immature.

116
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,640
The problem is

117
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,480
that you’ve not only disgusted him,

118
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,150
but also me.

119
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:25,610
How much is this?

120
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,060
This one?

121
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,720
It’s cheap.

122
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,050
Fatty.

123
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:28,480
You’ve changed

124
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,380
a lot in the past few years.

125
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,510
You bet.

126
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,240
My soul power has improved,

127
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,440
so has my appearance.

128
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,940
Don’t get too carried away.

129
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:37,840
But now

130
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,870
you don’t just

131
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,910
aim at winning in a fight.

132
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,040
You know the meaning of protection.

133
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,980
I’m impressed.

134
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,210
I’m overwhelmed.

135
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,780
In the championship,

136
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,940
you risked your life to fight against the Martial Soul Hall

137
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,640
to protect Sister Wu.

138
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,440
I feel ashamed

139
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,140
after thinking about that.

140
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,280
Ashamed?

141
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,440
Ashamed.

142
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,410
I had chased so many people

143
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,410
but I was never serious about anyone.

144
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,440
Alright.

145
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,340
Fatty,

146
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,640
it’s good that you understand now.

147
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,080
Later,

148
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,340
I’ll write a letter to Boss Dai

149
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,480
and ask him

150
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,210
to send the gang of Bu Le

151
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,010
to Xing Luo Empire for a trial.

152
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,180
Look at this.

153
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,480
<i>So peaceful.</i>

154
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,910
<i>I’m not sure how long this can last.</i>

155
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,410
Hello.

156
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,080
Greetings, Leader Tai Tan.

157

Tribe of Strength, welcome to my tribe.

158
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,610
You’re welcome.

159
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,810
Is Old Rhino here?

160
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:47,540
Our tribe chief is here.

161
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,380
Wait a minute.

162
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,040
I’ve sent someone to inform him.

163
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,410
Old Gorilla!

164
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,180
I could hear your loud voice

165
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,740
even when I was inside.

166
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,540
How dare you call me by my nickname?

167
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,540
You’re unhappy about it?

168
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:02,940
Shall we have a fight

169
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,610
if you think you can do it?

170
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,540
If you win,

171
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,040
I won’t call you Old Rhino anymore.

172
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,010
How is that?

173
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:18,510
This is

174
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,610
the Chief from the Tribe of Defense.

175
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,640
Not bad. Old Gorilla.

176
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,120
You have had greater strength.

177
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,180
Well...

178
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,310
I’m not as strong as you are,

179
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,080
but you can forget about

180
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,880
breaking these old bones of mine.

181
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,210
I know you’re tough.

182
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:36,840
Tai Long.

183
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,410
Come here.

184
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,340
Greet Grandpa Niu Gao.

185
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,710
Nice meeting you.

186
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,210
Grandpa Niu.

187
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,080
Tai Long.

188
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,040
You’re firm.

189
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,040
You do look like your grandfather
when he was young.

190
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,240
I think

191
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,910
you’ll have greater achievement
than your father.

192
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,310
Tai Nuo

193
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,840
is slightly thinner.

194
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,540
You call that...

195
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:00,380
thin?!

196
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:00,940
Let’s go.

197
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,240
Why aren’t you bringing us in yet?

198
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,400
We’ve waited here for so long.

199
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,040
I forgot as I was so excited to see you.

200
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:07,630
Let’s go!

201
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,540
Get in!

202
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,540
I’ve prepared

203
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,040
your favorite liquor.

204
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,680
Tonight,

205
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,810
we shall all get drunk.

206
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:45,010
[Soul Land]

207
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,740
Master San.

208
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,880
<i>Why is Tai Long</i>

209
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,680
<i>being so polite to this guy?</i>

210
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,010
Old Gorilla.

211
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,740
You haven’t introduced these two young men to me.

212
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,310
They don’t look like people from your tribe.

213
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,010
They are good friends of my grandson.

214
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,340
They studied at the same school.

215
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,240
I’m bringing them with me
to gain more experience.

216
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,880
Old Gorilla.

217
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,480
Why bother to hide from me?

218
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,840
Who exactly is this guy?

219
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,410
Why are you bringing him to our gathering?

220
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,010
Senior Niu Gao.

221
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:36,640
Hello.

222
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,240
I’m Tang San.

223
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,840
My father is Tang Hao.

224
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:40,740
What?

225
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,880
Old Gorilla.

226
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,540
What’s this about?

227
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,740
Hao Tian Tribe has brought us

228
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,510
enough suffering.

229
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,340
If it wasn’t for Tang Hao,

230
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,010
we wouldn’t end up like this.

231
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:54,810
Old Rhino.

232
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,780
Calm down.

233
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,480
Do you think the Martial Soul Hall

234
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,440
would leave Hao Tian Tribe in peace
without that matter of our master?

235
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,740
We hate Hao Tian Tribe, too.

236
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,180
They abandoned us, their subordinates.

237
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,680
But, what does that have to do with Tang San?

238
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:09,810
Old Gorilla!

239
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,580
If he wasn’t brought in here by you,

240
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,010
I would chase him out right away!

241
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,210
Ask him to leave!

242
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,440
Or else,

243
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,580
don’t blame me for being rude.

244
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:18,840
You...

245
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,340
Alright.

246
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,710
We’ll leave together.

247
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,540
We, Tribe of Strength,

248
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,080
won’t attend this gathering!

249
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:31,740
Senior!

250
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:32,980
Wait a minute.

251
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,410
Senior Niu Gao.

252
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,740
I would like to apologize for

253
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,780
what my father and Hao Tian Tribe did to

254
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,680
the four single attribute tribes.

255
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:45,740
I know.

256
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,410
My apology can’t change anything.

257
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:49,910
I’m here

258
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,880
to look for a way

259
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,140
to compensate these Four Tribes.

260
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,480
Has Hao Tian Tribe stopped being secluded?

261
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,140
The tribe is still closed,

262
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,710
I’m representing only me and my father,

263
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,310
not Hao Tian Tribe.

264
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,610
The status of Hao Tian Tribe

265
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,880
is none of our business.

266
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,740
We are doing well now.

267
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,680
We don’t need your compensation.

268
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,440
Moreover, what a brat like you can do

269
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,880
to compensate us?

270
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,310
Senior Niu Gao,

271
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,240
I hope you will give me a chance

272
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,310
to stay here

273
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,540
and attend this gathering.

274
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,780
A chance?

275
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,780
When Hao Tian Tribe announced their closure,

276
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,280
did they give us, the Four Tribes, a chance?

277
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,110
When your father

278
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,780
fought against the Martial Soul Hall,

279
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,010
did he ever consider our well-being?

280
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,980
Why shall I give you a chance? Huh?

281
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:36,940
Get lost!

282
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,110
Get lost!

283
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,510
Or else,

284
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,610
I’ll kick you out!

285
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,140
What a strong force!

286
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,640
It only affects my body

287
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,340
but I can’t move.

288
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,910
Old Rhino!

289
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:51,880
Senior Tai Tan.

290
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,510
I’ll settle it by myself.

291
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,940
God Killer Domain!

292
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,280
<i>He can resist my force?</i>

293
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,010
<i>He’s indeed the son of Tang Hao.</i>

294
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,180
Alright.

295
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,880
It’s okay if you want to stay.

296
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,040
You and I compete here.

297
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,280
As long as you can withstand my power

298
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,540
for half an hour,

299
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,340
you can not only stay,

300
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,980
our grudge

301
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,040
will also be wiped off the board.

302
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,010
Do you mean it?

303
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,240
I am the chief of a tribe.

304
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,340
Do you think I’ll break my promise?

305
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,340
Very good.

306
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:30,340
Seems like

307
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,380
we won’t have to leave today.

308
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,810
Old Gorilla.

309
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,240
Are you so confident about him?

310
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,480
My soul power

311
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,840
has reached Level 84 in the past two years.

312
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,810
How old is he?

313
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,110
As I said,

314
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,110
he has to withstand my attack for half an hour.

315
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,380
Old Rhino.

316
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,940
Don’t say that I didn’t remind you.

317
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,540
Tang San’s talent

318
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:50,910
surpasses

319
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,240
his father’s.

320
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,080
<i>Old Gorilla speaks so highly of him.</i>

321
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,910
<i>He must be good.</i>

322
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,140
Senior Niu Gao,

323
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,440
you’re the elder.

324
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,980
Why don’t we make it simple?

325
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:04,810
What do you mean?

326
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,080
Fatty.

327
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,040
Draw a circle on the ground with your fire.

328
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:15,980
A slightly bigger one.

329
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,440
What does this mean?

330
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:28,640
Senior.

331
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,240
This circle is the battle field.

332
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,710
We shall only use our soul power.

333
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,180
No martial soul skills are allowed.

334
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,480
If I manage to stay

335
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,810
in this circle for half an hour,

336
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,310
you’ll let me stay.

337
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,140
How is it?

338
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,740
Master San.

339
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,440
Grandpa Niu’s skill of defense

340
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,680
is the best on this continent.

341
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,580
And his soul power is much powerful than yours.

342
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,180
You’re in a unfavorable situation.

343
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:48,810
Young man.

344
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,110
You’re so arrogant.

345
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,310
How do I dare to be arrogant

346
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,610
in front of you two seniors?

347
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,740
I just hope that we can finish this nicely.

348
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:57,910
