1
00:00:29,534 --> 00:00:32,457
[Casualties have been medevacked.]

2
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,472
[Live from Shibuya.]

3
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:40,343
[I can see many cars ablaze
at Shibuya Crossing.]

4
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,646
[The destruction is like a war zone.]

5
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,312
[The area is closed off.
The cause remains unknown.]

6
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:25,932
Kurono!

7
00:02:28,368 --> 00:02:29,469
Your suit!

8
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:44,784
Don't.

9
00:02:45,518 --> 00:02:46,886
Someone has to.

10
00:02:46,953 --> 00:02:48,321
But you can't!

11
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,624
I have to!

12
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:53,760
Who else will?

14
00:02:58,698 --> 00:02:59,866
Kurono!

15
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:32,599
Kurono.

16
00:03:34,734 --> 00:03:36,035
How's Pop?

17
00:03:42,475 --> 00:03:43,476
He's alive!

18
00:03:46,045 --> 00:03:48,481
Good...

19
00:03:55,488 --> 00:03:58,491
Kurono? Please...

20
00:03:58,825 --> 00:04:02,028
Kurono! Kurono!

21
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,102
No! I don't want to go!

22
00:04:09,168 --> 00:04:10,970
Kurono!

23
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,803
See my shiny and wavy hair.

24
00:04:45,204 --> 00:04:46,973
Enrich your hair.

25
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,543
NEWSFLASH
OSAKA IS IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY

26
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,679
What's going on in Osaka?

27
00:04:53,046 --> 00:04:56,482
Maybe it's monsters, like in Shibuya?

28
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,587
-OSAKA'S IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY.
-YOU OKAY?

29
00:05:01,654 --> 00:05:03,856
LIKE THE KILLINGS IN TOKYO.

30
00:05:05,758 --> 00:05:09,128
It contains super rich
hyaluronic acid, Akatsuki.

31
00:05:09,195 --> 00:05:11,064
-IS IT THE U.S. MILITARY?
-IT'S MASSACRE!

32
00:05:22,742 --> 00:05:25,912
Ayumu, I'm in Shinjuku.
I'll catch a train.

33
00:05:27,146 --> 00:05:30,583
You're late. What have you been doing?

34
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:32,085
I'm sorry.

35
00:05:33,186 --> 00:05:36,656
Do you remember what today is?

36
00:05:40,727 --> 00:05:41,694
What is it?

37
00:05:53,873 --> 00:05:55,208
He has a knife!

38
00:05:57,744 --> 00:05:58,644
Police!

39
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:04,517
There!

40
00:06:12,592 --> 00:06:13,926
Where are you hurt?

41
00:06:15,528 --> 00:06:16,796
You'll be okay.

42
00:06:44,657 --> 00:06:46,325
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, AYUMU

43
00:07:08,981 --> 00:07:11,350
Am I alive?

44
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:24,163
Hey, you--

45
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:29,235
Are you in shock?

46
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:32,905
I got...

47
00:07:34,107 --> 00:07:35,041
stabbed.

48
00:07:36,275 --> 00:07:37,176
You were?

49
00:07:41,948 --> 00:07:44,750
I dropped dead from a stroke.

50
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:48,855
Reika here was in a car accident.

51
00:07:52,325 --> 00:07:53,226
Reika...

52
00:07:54,293 --> 00:07:55,261
The star?

53
00:07:55,761 --> 00:07:58,831
Oh, yeah. She's a big deal, right?

54
00:07:59,232 --> 00:08:02,702
I'm a bit out of touch,

55
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:05,738
but I saw her in a TV ad.

56
00:08:06,172 --> 00:08:08,241
What was it? Shampoo...

57
00:08:08,307 --> 00:08:10,409
Oh, please. Who cares?

58
00:08:13,012 --> 00:08:16,182
Aren't you her fan, Nishi?

59
00:08:16,816 --> 00:08:18,251
I know you schoolboys...

60
00:08:18,317 --> 00:08:19,819
Shut up, Baldy.

61
00:08:24,757 --> 00:08:26,859
What's your name?

62
00:08:30,429 --> 00:08:32,231
Masaru Kato.

63
00:08:33,366 --> 00:08:36,202
My name is Suzuki.

64
00:08:36,836 --> 00:08:38,704
Nice to meet you.

65
00:08:38,771 --> 00:08:40,439
What's going on?

66
00:08:41,274 --> 00:08:42,742
Explain!

67
00:08:45,678 --> 00:08:47,380
It's hard to believe,

68
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,918
but we all died before.

69
00:08:52,418 --> 00:08:53,686
What...?

70
00:08:53,753 --> 00:08:55,788
You told me the same thing.

71
00:08:56,222 --> 00:08:58,724
It makes no sense to me!

72
00:08:59,392 --> 00:09:03,396
Rise and shine
It's a new morning for us

73
00:09:03,462 --> 00:09:07,366
A morning of new hope

74
00:09:07,767 --> 00:09:11,737
Breathe in
A chest full of joy

75
00:09:11,804 --> 00:09:15,708
Look up at the clear, blue sky!

76
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,144
Listen to the radio

77
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,712
What's this?

78
00:09:19,979 --> 00:09:23,950
The summer breeze
It is so wholesome

79
00:09:24,016 --> 00:09:28,087
Breathe in and exercise now

80
00:09:28,154 --> 00:09:31,390
To the count of one, two and three

81
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,797
Your old lives have ended.

82
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:47,106
I will decide how to use your new lives.
That's the way the cookie crumbles.

83
00:09:49,175 --> 00:09:53,279
Go now and finish off this guy.

84
00:09:53,846 --> 00:09:55,848
Nurarihyon.

85
00:09:59,051 --> 00:10:01,520
HE KICKS ASS. HE WON'T GIVE UP.
KILL HIM IN GIVEN TIME.

86
00:10:01,787 --> 00:10:05,091
Oh, no. He looks tough!

87
00:10:05,891 --> 00:10:07,860
What is this thing?

88
00:10:09,095 --> 00:10:12,064
This black orb is... Gantz.

89
00:10:13,265 --> 00:10:14,200
Gantz?

90
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,971
I don't know why,
but that's what everyone calls it.

91
00:10:23,809 --> 00:10:25,044
What the hell?

92
00:10:26,178 --> 00:10:28,180
Are these toy guns?

93
00:10:29,515 --> 00:10:32,485
"Kato-cha, LOL." Is this mine?

94
00:10:34,153 --> 00:10:39,225
You two first-timers
had better get dressed now.

95
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:43,362
Don't tell me what to do, Baldy!

96
00:10:52,505 --> 00:10:55,908
Morons like him always die first.

97
00:10:56,976 --> 00:10:59,945
What's that, punk?

98
00:11:00,212 --> 00:11:02,515
You're just a stupid gamer.

99
00:11:03,816 --> 00:11:06,919
You have an attitude, school kid.

100
00:11:09,955 --> 00:11:12,591
I'm talking to you, punk!

101
00:11:13,492 --> 00:11:15,127
-Nishi!
-Don't!

102
00:11:29,975 --> 00:11:31,143
I told you.

103
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,144
Nishi!

104
00:11:32,511 --> 00:11:35,114
He would have only dragged us down.

105
00:11:41,187 --> 00:11:43,255
This guy looks useless, too.

106
00:11:43,489 --> 00:11:44,457
Are you okay?

107
00:11:45,124 --> 00:11:47,226
Put on the gear, Kato!

108
00:11:48,194 --> 00:11:49,361
Who are you?

109
00:11:51,263 --> 00:11:55,634
We're stuck playing
an endless survival game.

110
00:11:56,369 --> 00:11:58,070
A survival game?

111
00:11:58,137 --> 00:12:01,507
You must have seen it on the news.

112
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,977
You know the monster in Shibuya...?

113
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:07,513
We fight the monsters.

114
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,918
You mean,
you're the ones in the black suits?

115
00:12:14,253 --> 00:12:15,621
In the previous game,

116
00:12:16,322 --> 00:12:21,193
our toughest members
were eliminated unfortunately.

117
00:12:22,395 --> 00:12:24,063
We lost our leader.

118
00:12:26,398 --> 00:12:29,068
Gantz, beam me out of here.

119
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:34,940
Hurry up, Kato!

120
00:12:42,148 --> 00:12:44,283
Quickly, please!

121
00:12:51,056 --> 00:12:53,025
Put it on!

122
00:13:43,108 --> 00:13:44,376
Are you okay?

123
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:52,318
Wait a minute...

124
00:13:53,219 --> 00:13:54,286
DOTONBORI

125
00:13:54,353 --> 00:13:55,254
We're...

126
00:13:57,056 --> 00:13:58,257
This is Osaka!

127
00:13:59,525 --> 00:14:03,162
But we're always sent to Tokyo!

128
00:14:43,702 --> 00:14:46,605
She's out of range, moron.

129
00:15:09,795 --> 00:15:11,330
Are you okay?

130
00:15:12,698 --> 00:15:14,733
You guys are useless.

131
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:19,705
Sorry, I totally panicked.

132
00:15:19,772 --> 00:15:21,740
What's going on?

133
00:15:22,574 --> 00:15:24,510
Explain it to me.

134
00:15:24,577 --> 00:15:25,844
Fuck off.

135
00:15:26,111 --> 00:15:28,647
What's going on? What is she?

136
00:15:29,281 --> 00:15:31,350
-Why us?
-Wait, Nishi!

137
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,585
I'll tell him.

138
00:15:42,294 --> 00:15:44,563
Why do we have to fight them?

139
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,799
And who are they?

140
00:15:47,499 --> 00:15:49,335
We don't know.

141
00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:52,104
We only know one thing.

142
00:15:52,404 --> 00:15:57,309
We have to kill all the enemies
before our time runs out.

143
00:15:58,644 --> 00:16:00,613
What if we don't?

144
00:16:02,715 --> 00:16:03,582
Then...

145
00:16:07,553 --> 00:16:09,688
We'd all die.

146
00:16:09,755 --> 00:16:10,889
But...

147
00:16:12,324 --> 00:16:13,559
For real.

148
00:16:15,294 --> 00:16:18,263
We'd no longer exist in the world.

149
00:16:19,798 --> 00:16:21,567
That's the Gantz rules.

150
00:16:22,468 --> 00:16:24,737
What do you mean, rules?

151
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,141
Oh, no!

152
00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:31,710
Impossible!

153
00:16:52,598 --> 00:16:53,632
Come here.

154
00:17:29,501 --> 00:17:30,569
This way.

155
00:18:16,815 --> 00:18:18,817
Kato, go ahead and shoot!

156
00:18:30,395 --> 00:18:31,530
Kato!

157
00:18:45,978 --> 00:18:46,945
I'm okay?

158
00:18:47,946 --> 00:18:50,416
The suit protected you. Come on!

159
00:19:00,592 --> 00:19:01,827
Who did it?

160
00:19:04,329 --> 00:19:06,899
-He's lying!
-Are you?

161
00:19:25,884 --> 00:19:27,553
Who are they?

162
00:19:28,086 --> 00:19:31,523
You have a Tokyo accent.

163
00:19:32,024 --> 00:19:34,793
Are you the Osaka team?

164
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,395
Osaka team?

165
00:19:36,895 --> 00:19:38,630
So, there are more?

166
00:19:39,398 --> 00:19:41,833
How come you don't know that?

167
00:19:42,534 --> 00:19:45,037
This is his first game.

168
00:19:47,773 --> 00:19:51,710
A novice, a kid, a middle-aged man,
and a woman.

169
00:19:51,777 --> 00:19:53,712
How pathetic.

170
00:20:00,118 --> 00:20:01,386
Ouch!

171
00:20:01,453 --> 00:20:03,589
Is he okay?

172
00:20:04,089 --> 00:20:08,060
As long as you're still alive,
you'll get back all your limbs

173
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,663
when the stage is cleared.

174
00:20:12,097 --> 00:20:13,398
What...?

175
00:20:13,465 --> 00:20:17,769
How about that tough guy
who's called Kuro or something?

176
00:20:17,836 --> 00:20:19,137
He's dead.

177
00:20:20,806 --> 00:20:22,975
Wait a minute!

178
00:20:23,976 --> 00:20:25,010
It's Reika!

179
00:20:25,077 --> 00:20:28,113
Man! Look at the jugs on her!

180
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,081
Shit!

181
00:20:33,619 --> 00:20:35,821
Hey, the Tokyo team's not bad.

182
00:20:38,724 --> 00:20:40,025
More of them!

183
00:20:40,092 --> 00:20:41,760
Here we go!

184
00:20:50,569 --> 00:20:53,005
You just sit and watch, wimps.

185
00:20:59,678 --> 00:21:03,482
Reika, watch us finish them off.

186
00:21:03,749 --> 00:21:05,951
Then we can swap numbers.

187
00:21:06,184 --> 00:21:08,820
Come on, George!

188
00:21:12,457 --> 00:21:14,793
There are so many of them!

189
00:21:15,093 --> 00:21:17,562
I'll go for the right side.

190
00:21:17,796 --> 00:21:19,564
How about you?

191
00:22:23,962 --> 00:22:26,531
They're enjoying this...

192
00:22:36,975 --> 00:22:40,612
That's worth points. I'll have it.

193
00:23:10,242 --> 00:23:13,078
How about that, Reika?

194
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:20,786
The Osaka team is tough.

195
00:23:21,186 --> 00:23:24,623
What's that weapon and the bike thing?

196
00:23:27,292 --> 00:23:32,197
You can get superior weapons
if you score 100 points.

197
00:23:32,731 --> 00:23:33,932
One hundred points...?

198
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:36,702
After defeating the enemies,

199
00:23:37,169 --> 00:23:41,206
we're teleported back to the room
to get scored.

200
00:23:42,007 --> 00:23:43,909
100-POINT MENU

201
00:23:43,975 --> 00:23:46,611
If you get 100, you win the game.

202
00:23:50,048 --> 00:23:54,152
Gantz gives you three bonus options.

203
00:23:54,219 --> 00:23:55,687
Like what?

204
00:23:57,322 --> 00:23:59,357
Like superior weapons.

205
00:23:59,891 --> 00:24:02,594
Or resurrect a dead teammate.

206
00:24:02,661 --> 00:24:05,063
You can bring them back?

207
00:24:05,597 --> 00:24:08,733
Apparently. I've never done it.

208
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,001
And the third option?

209
00:24:10,802 --> 00:24:11,937
3. HAVE YOUR MEMORY WIPED AND QUIT.

210
00:24:12,003 --> 00:24:13,004
Graduation.

211
00:24:14,139 --> 00:24:15,740
You'll be free!

212
00:24:15,807 --> 00:24:16,842
Free?

213
00:24:17,843 --> 00:24:21,279
Score 100 points
and you can leave this all behind.

214
00:24:21,746 --> 00:24:26,818
You'll forget all about the Gantz games
and go back to your regular life.

215
00:24:28,754 --> 00:24:31,156
Anyway, it's good, isn't it?

216
00:24:31,823 --> 00:24:34,726
We won't have to do anything.

217
00:24:35,193 --> 00:24:38,196
The Osaka guys will wipe out the monsters.

218
00:24:38,697 --> 00:24:44,102
I'll let them have the small ones,
and I'll take the Boss at the end.

219
00:24:47,639 --> 00:24:52,978
Nishi's strategy is to hide and wait
for the strongest one at the end.

220
00:24:53,345 --> 00:24:56,982
Killing the Boss scores you
a lot of points.

221
00:24:58,083 --> 00:24:59,050
Help!

222
00:25:07,692 --> 00:25:09,895
We have to help those people.

223
00:25:10,662 --> 00:25:11,863
Come on, Suzuki.

224
00:25:13,064 --> 00:25:15,934
We should avoid any unnecessary risks.

225
00:25:16,001 --> 00:25:16,968
Suzuki!

226
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,972
-But isn't that what you do?
-Well...

227
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,841
Not without our leader...

228
00:25:23,108 --> 00:25:24,209
Come on!

229
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:30,715
We're not tough enough
to protect other people.

230
00:25:44,829 --> 00:25:49,167
We can leave it to the Osaka team...

231
00:25:50,068 --> 00:25:54,039
so that we can just concentrate
on surviving, okay?

232
00:25:55,207 --> 00:25:58,209
Kato, wait! Kato!

233
00:26:02,981 --> 00:26:06,218
If you must go, keep this.

234
00:26:09,721 --> 00:26:11,923
Someone's waiting for your call.

235
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:15,994
There are still some pay phones around.

236
00:26:21,199 --> 00:26:25,136
Make sure that you don't die.

237
00:26:55,934 --> 00:26:57,135
It's good.

238
00:26:58,937 --> 00:27:00,805
All the sauce we want!

239
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:12,851
Do you see that there?

240
00:27:16,855 --> 00:27:17,922
Yeah...

241
00:27:19,457 --> 00:27:21,259
It's no Biriken statue.

242
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:30,969
He's spooky.

243
00:27:44,849 --> 00:27:46,317
The Kato residence.

244
00:27:48,553 --> 00:27:49,854
Hello?

245
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:54,025
Ayumu, it's me.

246
00:27:55,293 --> 00:27:58,463
Where have you been?
I've been calling you.

247
00:27:59,497 --> 00:28:00,498
Sorry.

248
00:28:01,566 --> 00:28:03,401
I was called into work.

249
00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:06,438
On a night like this?

250
00:28:07,072 --> 00:28:09,407
With what's happening in Osaka?

251
00:28:13,144 --> 00:28:14,946
What's happening there?

252
00:28:15,847 --> 00:28:18,850
Some monsters are running wild in Osaka.

253
00:28:20,452 --> 00:28:21,853
Really?

254
00:28:23,021 --> 00:28:24,255
I had no idea.

255
00:28:25,423 --> 00:28:29,194
How is that even possible?
Anyway, just come home.

256
00:28:30,895 --> 00:28:31,896
Sorry.

257
00:28:33,098 --> 00:28:34,432
It'll be a while.

258
00:28:36,201 --> 00:28:39,270
Okay, see you later.

259
00:28:39,337 --> 00:28:40,271
Ayumu.

260
00:28:41,906 --> 00:28:42,941
What?

261
00:28:46,411 --> 00:28:48,046
I will come home.

262
00:28:49,647 --> 00:28:53,251
I know that!
I'll eat first, then go to bed.

263
00:29:11,536 --> 00:29:12,437
It's here!

264
00:29:26,551 --> 00:29:27,552
Damn it!

265
00:30:38,723 --> 00:30:40,225
Hi there!

266
00:30:44,329 --> 00:30:46,431
You with the Tokyo team?

267
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:49,367
Right.

268
00:30:50,168 --> 00:30:54,172
I'm Anzu Yamasaki,
from the Osaka team. And you?

269
00:30:56,574 --> 00:30:58,309
I'm Masaru Kato.

270
00:30:59,277 --> 00:31:02,247
How old are you? I'm 23.

271
00:31:03,381 --> 00:31:04,482
Seventeen.

272
00:31:05,116 --> 00:31:08,520
A high-school boy! You're just a kid.

273
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:14,225
I've been watching you.

274
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:18,496
I got really curious about...

275
00:31:19,063 --> 00:31:21,299
what you were doing.

276
00:31:23,167 --> 00:31:25,703
I'm sure I'm wrong, but...

277
00:31:26,504 --> 00:31:29,674
Did you just save that family?

278
00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:34,178
What were you really doing?

279
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:36,080
Well...

280
00:31:37,248 --> 00:31:38,783
I saved the family.

281
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:42,220
Oh, my God, it's impossible!

282
00:31:42,287 --> 00:31:43,254
I did.

283
00:31:43,321 --> 00:31:45,456
No! No one does that.

284
00:31:45,823 --> 00:31:47,125
But I did!

285
00:31:47,792 --> 00:31:51,529
Would you just watch someone get killed?

286
00:31:54,465 --> 00:31:55,700
Phony Alien!

287
00:32:01,139 --> 00:32:02,807
Are you upset?

288
00:32:03,575 --> 00:32:04,842
I'll help people.

289
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,312
Quit it.

290
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:09,847
You hypocrite.

291
00:32:10,782 --> 00:32:12,317
Don't follow me.

292
00:32:13,218 --> 00:32:17,422
Lighten up. I love watching weirdos.

293
00:32:20,258 --> 00:32:21,759
You're funny.

294
00:32:23,328 --> 00:32:26,764
I know you won't last long.

295
00:32:30,468 --> 00:32:31,736
I just remembered.

296
00:32:32,637 --> 00:32:36,274
I saw a kid hiding with some old people.

297
00:32:36,774 --> 00:32:38,743
I hope they're okay.

298
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:40,411
Where are they?

299
00:32:42,413 --> 00:32:44,315
You're such a show-off!

300
00:32:47,685 --> 00:32:52,190
Don't cry or the monsters will get us.

301
00:32:52,523 --> 00:32:55,626
We're finished. It's just like hell.

302
00:32:56,227 --> 00:32:58,596
It's okay if I die...

303
00:32:58,663 --> 00:33:01,699
but not the boy.

304
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,569
His life's just begun.

305
00:33:04,635 --> 00:33:07,238
I want to take him to his parents.

306
00:33:10,575 --> 00:33:12,910
Get away from it!

307
00:33:13,478 --> 00:33:16,381
You run! I'll take care of it!

308
00:33:16,447 --> 00:33:17,715
Honey!

309
00:33:28,326 --> 00:33:29,761
Honey!

310
00:33:34,666 --> 00:33:35,600
Honey!

311
00:33:43,341 --> 00:33:44,208
There they are.

312
00:33:45,743 --> 00:33:48,179
Are you okay? I'll save you!

313
00:33:48,813 --> 00:33:50,214
Back away!

314
00:33:53,818 --> 00:33:54,819
Run!

315
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:57,355
No. I'll save them!

316
00:33:57,422 --> 00:34:00,358
No way. You can't beat him!

317
00:34:04,429 --> 00:34:05,496
I'll save them.

318
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,665
Don't you dare!

319
00:34:08,966 --> 00:34:10,902
I know you're scared.

320
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:14,973
You'll die, you blockhead!

321
00:34:17,775 --> 00:34:21,446
Stop! He'll seriously kill you!

322
00:34:21,779 --> 00:34:22,880
You idiot!

323
00:34:27,251 --> 00:34:29,587
He can die if he wants to.

324
00:34:29,654 --> 00:34:32,757
He's just a hopeless moron...

325
00:34:34,459 --> 00:34:38,229
He is kind of cute though.

326
00:34:40,298 --> 00:34:42,700
Is there anything I can do, boy?

327
00:34:43,267 --> 00:34:44,402
Just move away.

328
00:34:45,303 --> 00:34:47,371
Idiots like that are rare.

329
00:34:48,673 --> 00:34:50,341
One of a kind...

330
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:00,551
Get back!

331
00:35:02,653 --> 00:35:03,821
What's this?

332
00:35:07,325 --> 00:35:09,861
Maybe I'm scared...

333
00:35:12,363 --> 00:35:13,931
...to see him die.

334
00:35:35,753 --> 00:35:36,921
How can I beat him?

335
00:35:40,992 --> 00:35:42,794
What an idiot!

336
00:35:53,704 --> 00:35:54,705
Damn it!

337
00:36:27,805 --> 00:36:28,706
Excuse me!

338
00:37:08,045 --> 00:37:09,380
Now what?

339
00:37:38,776 --> 00:37:39,777
Hey!

340
00:37:44,582 --> 00:37:45,616
Are you okay?

341
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,155
Hey, are you okay?

342
00:38:09,974 --> 00:38:12,843
Is there a doctor or a paramedic?

343
00:38:14,578 --> 00:38:17,548
Someone call an ambulance!

344
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:23,654
Major roads are swarming with citizens.

345
00:38:24,222 --> 00:38:28,960
Experts say that the creatures
are not of this Earth

346
00:38:29,026 --> 00:38:31,529
but of alien origin.

347
00:38:31,896 --> 00:38:33,864
You're gonna save more people?

348
00:38:37,702 --> 00:38:38,669
Yeah.

349
00:38:40,504 --> 00:38:44,742
Why are you acting like such a hero?

350
00:38:46,177 --> 00:38:47,578
Leave it alone.

351
00:38:48,212 --> 00:38:53,751
I'm just curious about your upbringing.

352
00:38:55,853 --> 00:38:58,689
What do your parents do?

353
00:39:00,191 --> 00:39:01,225
My parents?

354
00:39:03,227 --> 00:39:05,129
Dad was a firefighter.

355
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:08,699
He died with Mom in a car accident.

356
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,136
When I was in junior high.

357
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,774
Any siblings?

358
00:39:17,775 --> 00:39:19,510
A brother, 10.

359
00:39:19,877 --> 00:39:22,213
Is he in an orphanage?

360
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:26,650
I work so we can live in an apartment.

361
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:32,590
If you don't survive,
your brother would be left alone.

362
00:39:33,991 --> 00:39:34,959
Right.

363
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:39,129
I live with my 3-year-old son.

364
00:39:39,897 --> 00:39:41,665
You're a mom?

365
00:39:42,867 --> 00:39:45,169
Yeah. Do I look too young?

366
00:39:48,172 --> 00:39:52,710
Hey! Just say "yes"
whenever you're asked that.

367
00:39:58,316 --> 00:40:01,952
Anyway, we're both in a similar situation.

368
00:40:03,854 --> 00:40:05,723
We can't afford to die.

369
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:07,324
Never.

370
00:40:10,027 --> 00:40:11,062
Right.

371
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:13,964
We can't die.

372
00:40:17,935 --> 00:40:21,872
Military personnel have been deployed

373
00:40:22,073 --> 00:40:24,675
all across the city.

374
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:30,281
We have an update on the mysterious people
in black suits.

375
00:40:31,282 --> 00:40:34,852
This footage was just uploaded
to a video site.

376
00:40:35,886 --> 00:40:41,192
A young man in black fought
to protect an old couple and a child.

377
00:40:46,764 --> 00:40:48,599
THEY EXIST!

378
00:40:48,666 --> 00:40:50,835
-I'M IMPRESSED.
-GO, OSAKA!

379
00:40:50,901 --> 00:40:53,237
-SEE THE NEWS?
-IS IT REAL?

380
00:40:53,304 --> 00:40:56,006
-THE TV SAYS SO.
-GO, BLACK SUIT!

381
00:41:03,714 --> 00:41:04,848
Go now!

382
00:41:04,915 --> 00:41:06,117
Thank you.

383
00:41:16,794 --> 00:41:19,063
-Use the big gun!
-Not yet!

384
00:41:19,129 --> 00:41:20,798
I'll do it.

385
00:41:21,832 --> 00:41:25,002
There's something crazy about them...

386
00:41:29,673 --> 00:41:31,942
Guys like them always survive.

387
00:41:33,344 --> 00:41:34,979
That dark-skinned one...

388
00:41:35,246 --> 00:41:37,148
We call him George.

389
00:41:37,948 --> 00:41:40,117
His real name is Shimaki.

390
00:41:41,018 --> 00:41:42,386
He's won three bonuses.

391
00:41:44,955 --> 00:41:46,991
The tall skinhead is Nobuo Muroya.

392
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:49,693
We call him Nobuyan.

393
00:41:50,394 --> 00:41:51,929
He's won four times.

394
00:41:52,963 --> 00:41:54,999
He's a megalomaniac.

395
00:41:55,399 --> 00:41:56,700
And he's a reckless...

396
00:41:58,135 --> 00:41:59,737
self-appointed leader.

397
00:42:00,437 --> 00:42:01,305
But...

398
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,141
there's one more.

399
00:42:05,376 --> 00:42:06,744
Really?

400
00:42:08,078 --> 00:42:11,715
Hachiro Oka, a seven-time bonus winner.

401
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,852
He's somewhere.

402
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,889
He cloaks himself and goes into hiding.

403
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:32,770
Good...

404
00:42:46,116 --> 00:42:48,352
I hope Kato is doing okay.

405
00:42:52,756 --> 00:42:53,791
What's wrong?

406
00:42:56,126 --> 00:42:57,861
If Kurono was alive,

407
00:42:58,362 --> 00:43:02,199
would he have saved people like Kato?

408
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,770
I'm sure he would have.

409
00:43:08,205 --> 00:43:12,042
We can resurrect Kurono if we score 100.

410
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:16,213
We don't have a chance.

411
00:43:17,348 --> 00:43:18,983
But, Suzuki...

412
00:43:19,049 --> 00:43:23,020
We can hardly take care of ourselves.

413
00:43:27,257 --> 00:43:28,325
Oh, no!

414
00:44:22,379 --> 00:44:24,815
There's one in Japan?

415
00:44:29,019 --> 00:44:31,188
Is it on our side?

416
00:44:57,081 --> 00:45:00,017
The Boss creature should be 100 points.

417
00:45:00,551 --> 00:45:03,587
One hundred points for one creature?

418
00:45:03,987 --> 00:45:05,956
Yeah, 100 for one.

419
00:45:06,357 --> 00:45:11,128
The monsters on the tower look badass.

420
00:45:12,029 --> 00:45:15,065
Killing one won't get 100 points.

421
00:45:15,132 --> 00:45:18,569
Oka says it's happened before.

422
00:45:18,635 --> 00:45:19,903
Really?

423
00:45:20,871 --> 00:45:24,875
It was before our time.
Before we went to the room.

424
00:45:25,943 --> 00:45:28,278
Everyone died except Oka.

425
00:45:29,013 --> 00:45:31,181
Oka killed the Boss monster.

426
00:45:31,582 --> 00:45:32,883
By himself!

427
00:45:34,051 --> 00:45:35,953
He's a monster himself!

428
00:45:53,904 --> 00:45:54,638
Oh, God.

429
00:45:55,906 --> 00:45:57,007
What's that?

430
00:45:58,008 --> 00:46:01,245
It's way out of our league.

431
00:46:01,311 --> 00:46:03,547
Freeze! Put your hands up!

432
00:46:05,682 --> 00:46:06,950
Wait!

433
00:46:08,552 --> 00:46:09,420
Don't shoot!

434
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:14,124
Kato!

435
00:46:14,525 --> 00:46:15,459
Don't shoot!

436
00:46:16,226 --> 00:46:19,363
You in the black suits! Who are you with?

437
00:46:19,663 --> 00:46:21,265
-I'll shoot!
-Wait!

438
00:46:22,166 --> 00:46:26,003
-We're agents.
-State your unit.

439
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:27,571
Our unit is...

440
00:46:28,305 --> 00:46:29,306
Gantz.

441
00:46:31,008 --> 00:46:32,142
Gantz?

442
00:46:35,445 --> 00:46:37,581
He's in even more trouble!

443
00:46:38,081 --> 00:46:40,117
-Show your ID!
-We don't have any.

444
00:46:40,417 --> 00:46:41,685
But it's true!

445
00:46:41,952 --> 00:46:43,220
-I'll shoot!
-No!

446
00:46:43,687 --> 00:46:44,722
Wait a minute.

447
00:47:06,043 --> 00:47:07,277
Fire!

448
00:47:11,415 --> 00:47:13,317
Run, all of you!

449
00:47:30,167 --> 00:47:31,268
Watch Suzuki!

450
00:47:55,225 --> 00:47:56,426
Come and get me!

451
00:48:38,735 --> 00:48:39,770
No way.

452
00:49:00,657 --> 00:49:01,725
Well?

453
00:49:04,361 --> 00:49:05,362
Hey.

454
00:49:06,229 --> 00:49:08,365
You're shitting me.

455
00:49:14,571 --> 00:49:16,206
It's not dead.

456
00:49:17,307 --> 00:49:18,709
Is it a 100?

457
00:49:19,609 --> 00:49:20,878
I'll do him.

458
00:49:25,348 --> 00:49:28,819
You'll be flatter than paper
when I'm through.

459
00:49:42,299 --> 00:49:45,202
Pretty tough, aren't you?

460
00:49:45,268 --> 00:49:46,570
You cockroach.

461
00:50:11,428 --> 00:50:12,863
Stop playing!

462
00:50:15,665 --> 00:50:17,467
You fuck!

463
00:50:27,344 --> 00:50:30,514
You goddamn motherfucker!

464
00:50:32,749 --> 00:50:34,484
Fucking help!

465
00:50:34,551 --> 00:50:38,755
Boo-hoo, can't you take care of yourself?

466
00:50:55,973 --> 00:50:59,910
I bet you shit your pants, Muroya.

467
00:51:11,354 --> 00:51:12,823
Fuck...

468
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:16,693
He's dead.

469
00:51:17,928 --> 00:51:18,895
No way!

470
00:51:34,344 --> 00:51:35,979
So, you're their boss?

471
00:51:36,847 --> 00:51:38,548
That old man?

472
00:51:47,257 --> 00:51:48,959
Gotcha!

473
00:52:07,577 --> 00:52:08,745
What the...?

474
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,515
What is this?

475
00:52:13,583 --> 00:52:15,485
What is it?

476
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:02,365
I've caught you!

477
00:53:25,555 --> 00:53:27,757
This can't be true!

478
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:30,026
They're both dead!

479
00:53:34,631 --> 00:53:35,832
What's your plan?

480
00:53:37,968 --> 00:53:40,704
I'll do whatever I can.

481
00:53:41,104 --> 00:53:42,739
You'll die!

482
00:53:43,006 --> 00:53:45,041
Think of your brother!

483
00:53:45,108 --> 00:53:47,744
That's why it has to be done.

484
00:53:49,145 --> 00:53:50,780
Otherwise...

485
00:53:51,648 --> 00:53:53,083
we'll all die.

486
00:53:55,986 --> 00:53:57,620
But how?

487
00:53:58,388 --> 00:54:01,925
Hey! Hey! Don't be stupid!

488
00:54:38,795 --> 00:54:39,963
She just dodges it!

489
00:54:50,674 --> 00:54:52,075
She's too quick.

490
00:54:53,843 --> 00:54:55,011
All together!

491
00:55:19,769 --> 00:55:20,804
She was hit.

492
00:55:33,516 --> 00:55:35,852
A hit to the head has no effect!

493
00:55:40,056 --> 00:55:41,124
Cover me.

494
00:55:46,796 --> 00:55:49,866
Ayumu, I promise you.

495
00:55:51,201 --> 00:55:53,003
I'll come home!

496
00:56:44,821 --> 00:56:46,589
I got the Boss!

497
00:56:59,702 --> 00:57:02,839
You almost blew us all up!

498
00:57:03,206 --> 00:57:07,677
Big deal! I went for his arm anyway.

499
00:57:12,282 --> 00:57:13,817
We made it...

500
00:57:15,251 --> 00:57:17,587
We beat the Osaka team.

501
00:57:38,074 --> 00:57:39,142
No...

502
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:42,145
What the heck?

503
00:57:46,649 --> 00:57:47,784
Oh, God!

504
00:58:08,838 --> 00:58:09,839
Run.

505
00:58:15,311 --> 00:58:16,312
Run!

506
01:00:13,162 --> 01:00:14,397
We lost...

507
01:00:14,864 --> 01:00:16,265
Look at its head.

508
01:00:26,309 --> 01:00:28,311
-It's Oka.
-Oka?

509
01:00:29,145 --> 01:00:30,313
Hachiro Oka!

510
01:00:44,794 --> 01:00:46,062
He got it!

511
01:01:00,943 --> 01:01:02,178
Still bleeding.

512
01:01:03,179 --> 01:01:06,015
Hey, can you hear me?

513
01:01:08,418 --> 01:01:10,887
Kato, look at that!

514
01:01:14,257 --> 01:01:15,358
It's alive.

515
01:01:16,125 --> 01:01:17,060
Shit!

516
01:01:21,864 --> 01:01:22,832
Oka...

517
01:01:25,435 --> 01:01:29,372
So, if you live to the end of the game,
you'll recover?

518
01:01:29,439 --> 01:01:31,407
Well, yes...

519
01:01:33,042 --> 01:01:35,011
If Oka beats him quickly,

520
01:01:36,212 --> 01:01:37,547
it will help.

521
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,228
It's too powerful!

522
01:01:53,229 --> 01:01:55,565
I don't even know how it attacked me.

523
01:01:57,633 --> 01:01:59,335
Oka can do it.

524
01:02:00,369 --> 01:02:02,071
He'll beat it!

525
01:02:03,005 --> 01:02:04,607
He's won seven times.

526
01:02:05,275 --> 01:02:06,509
Hachiro Oka.

527
01:02:25,595 --> 01:02:30,566
You're deluded
if you think you can beat me, sucker!

528
01:02:40,176 --> 01:02:43,680
What you don't know is,
I played Ping-Pong in college!

529
01:02:52,121 --> 01:02:54,223
I also took karate lessons...

530
01:02:55,124 --> 01:02:57,093
by correspondence!

531
01:03:20,116 --> 01:03:21,417
Amazing.

532
01:03:22,552 --> 01:03:24,253
Did he win...?

533
01:03:25,621 --> 01:03:27,223
You want to die?

534
01:03:29,258 --> 01:03:32,195
It's not over. Can't you see?

535
01:03:41,137 --> 01:03:44,507
I find this fascinating.

536
01:03:45,575 --> 01:03:47,677
Very fascinating.

537
01:03:58,688 --> 01:04:00,756
I think I got it.

538
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,437
I've got it. Here I go!

539
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,061
He'll lose...

540
01:04:40,229 --> 01:04:42,031
Come on, boy!

541
01:05:00,716 --> 01:05:02,118
Oka, no!

542
01:05:25,775 --> 01:05:27,343
Eat this!

543
01:05:44,293 --> 01:05:47,163
Only intuitive attacks work on him.

544
01:05:55,538 --> 01:05:57,873
Is it over? Did he die?

545
01:05:58,841 --> 01:05:59,775
Not yet.

546
01:06:00,209 --> 01:06:02,511
-No?
-What do you mean?

547
01:06:03,279 --> 01:06:06,315
Only surprise attacks work. I'll go cloak.

548
01:06:06,382 --> 01:06:09,285
You should finish him off now!

549
01:06:10,519 --> 01:06:11,888
No, it's risky.

550
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:18,461
Damn it...

551
01:06:25,768 --> 01:06:26,869
It is risky.

552
01:06:28,137 --> 01:06:29,305
I know.

553
01:06:30,172 --> 01:06:31,340
But...

554
01:06:32,675 --> 01:06:34,310
someone's got to do it.

555
01:06:36,679 --> 01:06:37,713
Kato!

556
01:07:09,612 --> 01:07:10,680
Kato!

557
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:20,690
Suzuki! Why did you...?

558
01:07:22,325 --> 01:07:23,759
Your brother...

559
01:07:25,227 --> 01:07:27,396
He's waiting for you.

560
01:07:30,666 --> 01:07:32,968
Suzuki! Suzuki!

561
01:08:01,230 --> 01:08:02,331
Reika.

562
01:08:03,666 --> 01:08:05,368
Watch Suzuki.

563
01:08:06,635 --> 01:08:07,636
But it's...

564
01:08:08,437 --> 01:08:09,305
too late.

565
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:12,775
We can save him.

566
01:08:18,914 --> 01:08:20,316
What about you?

567
01:08:20,883 --> 01:08:21,984
I'll do it.

568
01:08:24,754 --> 01:08:25,888
I'll finish the game.

569
01:08:27,857 --> 01:08:29,792
-Kato!
-Don't!

570
01:08:36,566 --> 01:08:39,001
Where's that other guy?

571
01:08:39,802 --> 01:08:41,771
He was fun to play with.

572
01:09:11,467 --> 01:09:15,371
Stay here. I'll kill you later.

573
01:09:20,309 --> 01:09:22,945
Hey, are you okay?

574
01:09:24,914 --> 01:09:30,019
-What now?
-We can run and leave it to Oka!

575
01:09:30,552 --> 01:09:31,954
And if he loses?

576
01:09:32,021 --> 01:09:33,656
But...

577
01:09:33,722 --> 01:09:36,892
We have to think of a way to win!

578
01:09:37,493 --> 01:09:38,994
It's impossible.

579
01:09:39,795 --> 01:09:43,599
We can't die.
We both have someone waiting for us.

580
01:09:48,004 --> 01:09:49,772
That's why I'm going.

581
01:09:52,108 --> 01:09:53,509
I have to!

582
01:09:55,044 --> 01:09:58,013
I have to! Who else will?

583
01:10:00,416 --> 01:10:01,717
You're right.

584
01:10:03,118 --> 01:10:04,486
We have to.

585
01:10:05,521 --> 01:10:06,388
Reika.

586
01:10:06,455 --> 01:10:08,924
How can we beat that thing?

587
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:14,063
Oka said it must be a surprise attack.

588
01:10:14,697 --> 01:10:16,799
How do we surprise him?

589
01:10:17,733 --> 01:10:19,101
Maybe we can snipe him.

590
01:10:23,606 --> 01:10:24,707
Good idea.

591
01:10:25,674 --> 01:10:30,079
I'll be a decoy. When he approaches,
shoot him from a distance.

592
01:10:30,546 --> 01:10:32,815
Are you out of your mind?!

593
01:10:37,119 --> 01:10:39,021
We have no choice.

594
01:10:42,825 --> 01:10:46,428
Are you sure we want to snipe him?

595
01:11:20,429 --> 01:11:21,697
Ayumu.

596
01:11:28,137 --> 01:11:29,138
What's wrong?

597
01:11:32,074 --> 01:11:33,509
Listen.

598
01:11:34,743 --> 01:11:37,546
I have to say this before I go.

599
01:11:39,682 --> 01:11:40,849
You...

600
01:11:42,585 --> 01:11:45,621
You mean a lot to me.

601
01:11:50,993 --> 01:11:52,228
Please don't die.

602
01:11:54,663 --> 01:11:56,532
Do not die, okay?

603
01:11:59,134 --> 01:12:00,703
I don't intend to.

604
01:12:04,573 --> 01:12:05,775
You mean it?

605
01:12:06,842 --> 01:12:08,644
You really mean it?

606
01:12:09,745 --> 01:12:10,746
Yes.

607
01:12:12,848 --> 01:12:16,785
I won't give up,
even if the odds are against me.

608
01:12:22,525 --> 01:12:23,992
Promise me.

609
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:28,697
If you survive,
the four of us can live together.

610
01:12:29,798 --> 01:12:33,035
You, your brother, me, and my boy.

611
01:12:34,603 --> 01:12:38,173
All right? Make a promise.

612
01:12:44,112 --> 01:12:45,247
Come on!

613
01:12:46,715 --> 01:12:50,519
Just say "yes" when you're asked that.

614
01:12:56,025 --> 01:12:57,059
Yes.

615
01:12:59,795 --> 01:13:01,029
It's a promise.

616
01:13:03,699 --> 01:13:05,133
Don't break it!

617
01:13:11,173 --> 01:13:12,274
I'll protect you.

618
01:13:13,909 --> 01:13:15,110
I won't let you die!

619
01:13:16,778 --> 01:13:20,115
Watch me get a bull's-eye on that thing!

620
01:13:28,791 --> 01:13:31,660
I will make it home.

621
01:13:35,130 --> 01:13:36,265
For sure.

622
01:13:44,072 --> 01:13:45,274
What the...?

623
01:14:20,876 --> 01:14:23,646
They're not in position yet...

624
01:14:36,758 --> 01:14:37,793
Wait.

625
01:14:41,196 --> 01:14:42,631
Let me ask you.

626
01:14:44,099 --> 01:14:46,669
Why are we...

627
01:14:47,636 --> 01:14:49,371
killing each other?

628
01:14:51,941 --> 01:14:55,878
Do you feel that you're in God's presence?

629
01:14:56,778 --> 01:14:57,713
God?

630
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:03,018
God is the absolute power.

631
01:15:05,688 --> 01:15:07,155
You're God...

632
01:15:08,256 --> 01:15:09,958
are you?

633
01:15:10,425 --> 01:15:15,697
This world has many.
I'm merely one of them.

634
01:15:16,365 --> 01:15:20,302
There is no defying that fact.

635
01:15:27,175 --> 01:15:28,677
I hit him!

636
01:15:38,253 --> 01:15:39,788
We'll live together!

637
01:15:40,889 --> 01:15:42,358
I'll end this!

638
01:15:43,892 --> 01:15:44,960
Die!

639
01:15:52,968 --> 01:15:54,236
I got it.

640
01:15:55,037 --> 01:15:56,071
I see.

641
01:15:59,174 --> 01:16:01,377
I can finish him off!

642
01:16:08,784 --> 01:16:10,719
He's just shooting blind.

643
01:17:05,307 --> 01:17:06,442
Kato!

644
01:18:50,912 --> 01:18:52,948
I got the Big Boss.

645
01:20:55,303 --> 01:20:56,471
It's over.

646
01:20:58,506 --> 01:21:00,375
It's really over.

647
01:22:34,336 --> 01:22:35,470
But I...

648
01:22:37,338 --> 01:22:39,407
I was of no help.

649
01:22:40,375 --> 01:22:41,609
Me neither.

650
01:22:42,377 --> 01:22:44,279
Kato did everything.

651
01:22:46,448 --> 01:22:47,549
Where is he?

652
01:22:48,683 --> 01:22:49,651
Oh, no!

653
01:22:51,486 --> 01:22:52,687
I guess he's dead.

654
01:22:54,656 --> 01:22:56,224
No...

655
01:22:57,325 --> 01:22:58,660
He did so much...

656
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:00,528
Gantz.

657
01:23:01,529 --> 01:23:03,264
Score me.

658
01:23:11,139 --> 01:23:12,641
Live from Osaka.

659
01:23:13,542 --> 01:23:17,479
With no explosions,
the Dotonbori area is very quiet.

660
01:23:17,546 --> 01:23:18,580
EAT BY YOURSELF.

661
01:23:19,915 --> 01:23:22,617
There's no sign of the creatures.

662
01:23:23,651 --> 01:23:27,489
Soldiers are assessing the situation.

663
01:23:30,292 --> 01:23:32,661
We only returned because of Kato...

664
01:24:00,254 --> 01:24:01,289
Kato!

665
01:24:03,825 --> 01:24:05,193
I...

666
01:24:06,361 --> 01:24:07,662
You survived.

667
01:24:08,530 --> 01:24:09,397
Oh, God!

668
01:24:10,265 --> 01:24:11,900
I'm so happy.

669
01:24:13,335 --> 01:24:14,803
You barely made it.

670
01:24:23,478 --> 01:24:26,281
It's time to score your points.

671
01:24:36,558 --> 01:24:38,293
Jugs, six points.

672
01:24:41,830 --> 01:24:43,598
Baldy, two points.

673
01:24:47,402 --> 01:24:49,404
Nishi, 12 points.

674
01:24:52,374 --> 01:24:55,343
It's your turn, Kato.

675
01:25:00,315 --> 01:25:03,484
Kato-cha, LOL, 100 points.

676
01:25:04,019 --> 01:25:05,787
-Shit!
-Amazing!

677
01:25:05,854 --> 01:25:07,488
You cleared it!

678
01:25:08,423 --> 01:25:09,724
Did I...?

679
01:25:12,860 --> 01:25:14,696
Bonus menu.

680
01:25:14,762 --> 01:25:18,933
One, weapon.
Two, resurrection. Three, freedom.

681
01:25:31,846 --> 01:25:34,882
2. RESURRECT A DEAD PLAYER.

682
01:25:34,949 --> 01:25:37,018
3. HAVE YOUR MEMORY WIPED AND QUIT.

683
01:25:37,285 --> 01:25:38,853
Choose three and you're free.

684
01:25:39,621 --> 01:25:43,358
And go back to living
with your brother like before.

685
01:25:44,058 --> 01:25:45,060
I'm happy for you.

686
01:25:47,028 --> 01:25:48,063
Kato.

687
01:25:49,297 --> 01:25:50,331
Thank you.

688
01:25:50,999 --> 01:25:52,367
Goodbye.

689
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:53,968
Have a nice life.

690
01:26:29,671 --> 01:26:30,638
Hey...?

691
01:26:34,676 --> 01:26:36,110
I didn't die...

692
01:26:47,622 --> 01:26:48,923
Oh, that fool...

693
01:26:51,659 --> 01:26:54,028
That hypocrite!

694
01:26:59,567 --> 01:27:03,571
KATO-CHA (LOL) 100 POINTS

695
01:27:19,554 --> 01:27:22,490
You think she was resurrected?

696
01:27:23,758 --> 01:27:25,827
But why, Kato?

697
01:27:26,461 --> 01:27:28,796
What about your brother?

698
01:27:29,731 --> 01:27:32,167
You'll have to join the game again.

699
01:27:32,867 --> 01:27:34,635
You could die.

700
01:27:35,636 --> 01:27:38,640
But I made her a promise.

701
01:27:45,546 --> 01:27:46,915
That's lame.

702
01:27:52,787 --> 01:27:54,122
I can leave?

703
01:27:59,727 --> 01:28:02,764
My brother's waiting at home!

704
01:28:18,213 --> 01:28:19,981
You didn't tell Kato

705
01:28:20,948 --> 01:28:23,818
that he used to fight with us.

706
01:28:24,185 --> 01:28:25,787
Your brother's waiting.

707
01:28:28,022 --> 01:28:29,223
Choose three.

708
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:33,728
Kei...

709
01:28:39,767 --> 01:28:45,540
If I had, he'd fight to resurrect
everyone who'd ever died in the game.

710
01:28:46,741 --> 01:28:47,976
You're right.

711
01:28:54,482 --> 01:28:57,485
I choose three. Free me.

712
01:29:05,259 --> 01:29:08,763
I never thought he'd be back!

713
01:29:10,999 --> 01:29:13,167
He hasn't changed a bit.

714
01:29:15,837 --> 01:29:18,806
Every time it's the same for him.

715
01:29:19,774 --> 01:29:23,110
He risks his life for others.

716
01:29:25,246 --> 01:29:27,949
Kurono was like that, too.

717
01:29:32,887 --> 01:29:34,255
I'll do the same.

718
01:29:37,558 --> 01:29:38,526
One day...

719
01:29:39,961 --> 01:29:41,796
I'll get Kurono back.

720
01:29:57,578 --> 01:29:58,579
I'm home!
