1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,850
Here he comes!

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,600
The one we've been waiting for!

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,350
The crowd's mood has changed.

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,050
Why, though?

5
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,830
To think we'd be able to
see this man fight again!

6
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,110
The crowd is quivering in bliss!

7
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,830
Suiryu is here!

8
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,600
He'll be going up against Max!

9
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,750
He's got quite the reputation,
but is he actually better than me?

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,210
No... Remember, Lightning Max.

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,090
The opponent I really need to surpass...

12
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:39,970
Compared to that monster, you're puny.

13
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,600
Suiryu, I have to get stronger.

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,270
Otherwise, I won't be able to
protect everyone as a hero.

15
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:48,980
Unfortunately for you,

16
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:55,320
I view you as a worthy opponent for
testing a new anti-monster technique!

17
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,350
So you're a pro hero?

18
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:03,080
With rather lofty ambitions, I see.

19
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,830
I guess everyone has their own
reasons for seeking strength.

20
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,610
Take your stance.

21
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,090
Begin!

22
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:17,090
Lightning Big Wheel Double Ax Kick!

23
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,890
The reason I sought strength...

24
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,640
was so I could glide through life easily.

25
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,990
Sorry I'm the stronger one.

26
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,270
The Uprising of the Monsters

27
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,760
D-Did you see that, Charanko?!

28
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,570
Did you see Suiryu's kick?!

29
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,840
Yeah, why?

30
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,880
How are you so calm right now?

31
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,800
Oh, it must be because he's an amateur.

32
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,520
He took down a Class A
hero in a single blow.

33
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,510
I guess there's a surprising
number of civilians

34
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,020
who are stronger than pro heroes.

35
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,810
I guess that's to be expected.

36
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,980
Master Saitama was also
doing hero work as a hobby.

37
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,130
It makes sense that there could be
other powerful people like him.

38
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:43,420
I'm sure none of them are
on Master's level, though.

39
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:48,660
But that man might be able to satisfy
Master's desire to experience martial arts.

40
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:52,870
This is...

41
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,230
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure
you're even more fired up now,

42
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,180
but next up,

43
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,300
we have Benpats from Bad Roads Martial
Arts and Snek from Snakebite Fist!

44
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,290
Whoever wins this fight will face off
against Suiryu in the second round!

45
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,940
You're a Class A hero?

46
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,520
You don't look very strong.

47
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,690
If I can defeat Suiryu,
who defeated Lightning Max,

48
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,190
it might have a positive effect on my rank.

49
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,190
All right.

50
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,420
Snakebite Fist.

51
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:23,360
Like anyone would fall for a fake
stance like that nowadays.

52
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,490
You lowest-ranking hero jerk!

53
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,870
I'm not the lowest ranking.

54
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,040
I'm the lowest-ranking Class A hero!

55
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,750
Commentators' Booth

56
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:31,750
There's trouble!

57
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,330
An extremely violent monster
has appeared nearby!

58
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,960
We need to evacuate everyone immediately!

59
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,280
Seriously? Hurry up and
make the announcement—

60
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,630
There's no need.

61
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,600
Huh? Bakuzan!

62
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,770
That'll just cause people to panic.

63
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,760
But if a monster shows up at this venue...

64
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,720
Look at how many martial
arts masters we have here.

65
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,270
No place could be safer.

66
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,760
True...

67
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,090
Don't worry. If any monsters
infiltrate the venue,

68
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,980
I'll take care of them myself.

69
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,970
Monsters have appeared, huh?

70
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,990
That's way too many.

71
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,660
City C... There's one in this city, too.

72
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,580
Should I let Master know?

73
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,370
No, I can just go take care of it myself.

74
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,110
I won't let it interfere
with this tournament.

75
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,460
No matter how many small fry there are,
I'll dispose of them immediately.

76
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,970
Wh-What the hell?

77
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,860
You aren't weak at all...

78
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,050
The winner is Snek!

79
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,940
I want to believe that I rank
among the strongest myself.

80
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,390
But you get sick of the reality pretty quick.

81
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,040
The battlefield of top heroes is
filled with nothing but monsters.

82
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,260
Incinerate.

83
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,570
It's the Demon Cyborg!

84
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,430
That was some blow!

85
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,580
We're saved!

86
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,930
I'm currently in City C near the stadium.
What's the situation?

87
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,920
Multiple monsters have appeared
simultaneously in several cities.

88
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,380
We've confirmed that there are
currently five in City C.

89
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,310
Mr. Demon Cyborg,
there's another monster over there.

90
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,010
There's one over there, too!

91
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,460
I got rid of one.

92
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,230
Where are the other four?

93
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,270
I'll guide you to them.

94
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,520
A blow charged with electricity!

95
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,520
Bazuzu VS Boltane

96
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,020
The winner is Boltane!

97
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,020
Winner:
Boltane

98
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,030
Gatling's super fast punches have
finally taken down Hamukichi.

99
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:30,070
He can no longer stand!

100
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,070
Winner:
Gatling

101
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,200
Dave immediately opened the match
with an explosive body press!

102
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,160
Winner:
Dave

103
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,160
Rosie was taken down in mere seconds!

104
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,080
And the referee had to interfere!

105
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,790
Choze is strong!

106
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,000
Mentai didn't stand a chance!

107
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,880
Winner:
Choze

108
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,420
Rocket Stomp!

109
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,890
I know there's another
one of you in the area.

110
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:57,470
Tell me where they are or continue
to suffer until you die.

111
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,730
Choose one.

112
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,810
Next up, we have Jakumen
from Giga Pro Wrestling

113
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,220
versus Sourface from Sourface-Style Kenpo!

114
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,850
They are both competing
here for the first time!

115
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,300
Do your best out there, Sourface!

116
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,310
Shut up! I used to be
Master Bang's second-best student!

117
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,500
This guy's pretty huge.

118
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,950
No, wait. I'm stronger!

119
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,900
I think...

120
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,410
Think back on all of your rigorous training!

121
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:27,250
This guy's face is pretty scary...

122
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,470
Lemme have your face.

123
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,720
There you are. I'm going to eliminate you.

124
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,960
Oh, hey. If it isn't a celebrity.

125
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,020
Can I rip off your face, too?

126
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,970
How do you like my knifework?

127
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,050
I had you hit my hard head on purpose.

128
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,550
High Voltage Fist!

129
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,090
Begone.

130
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,100
He's taking care of them in seconds.

131
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,270
The Class S hero, Genos...
He's incredibly powerful.

132
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:27,440
Demon Cyborg... The last one is two
kilometers northwest from there.

133
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,900
There are already others
engaged in battle there.

134
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,410
Can you speak?

135
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,160
Wh-When you're fighting him,
make sure you don't lose sight of him.

136
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,290
He'll be behind you before you know it.

137
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,480
Are you a Class S hero?

138
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,790
Do you hate cockroaches, too?

139
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:52,210
Not cockroaches in particular, but I have
a long-running feud with bug monsters.

140
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,970
The last one.

141
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,700
If I can take care of
this one with no issues,

142
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,050
I might make it to Master's match in time.

143
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,770
Just so you know, I'm strong.

144
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,540
Jakumen ends up tapping out!

145
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,060
That was an excellent finishing
move on Sourface's part!

146
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,440
And they're holding each other up!

147
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,150
What beautiful sportsmanship!

148
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,490
Did you win, Sourface?

149
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,550
What?! Weren't you watching, Charanko?

150
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,530
Didn't you see how awesome I was?

151
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,950
I was in the bathroom.

152
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,510
You jerk...

153
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:26,620
Hey! The guy you're up against next...

154
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,540
Be careful with him.

155
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,130
I've seen Bakuzan in action before.

156
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,630
Crap... I undid my obi in the bathroom,

157
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,630
He shows no mercy to inferior opponents...

158
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,510
Hey!

159
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,510
and I don't know how to retie it.

160
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,300
Are you listening?!

161
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:42,500
Next up, we have Charanko,
fresh off a victory over Zakkos,

162
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,310
versus Bakuzan, a former
two-time consecutive winner!

163
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:51,730
He is the master of Darkness Hellkill,
which has left many fighters bloody!

164
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:57,780
Will he be sending even more of his
opponents to the hospital this time around?

165
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,160
I'm just teaching those
who lack resolve a lesson.

166
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:07,820
Listen up. When two martial
artists fight, it's not a sport.

167
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,950
Lives are at stake...

168
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,560
Hey!

169
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,240
Well, whatever. This should work.

170
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,010
I'm going to kill you.

171
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:16,590
Begin!

172
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:22,510
And it's begun! How does Charanko
plan to fight against Bakuzan?

173
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,890
He's wide open. What's with this guy?

174
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,560
Does he even have the will to fight?

175
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,110
Uh-oh! Bakuzan is closing
the gap between them!

176
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,100
Hey, you.

177
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,300
Are you an amateur?

178
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,990
Yeah. This is actually my first
time doing one of these things.

179
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,240
Let me experience your
martial arts technique.

180
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,400
Very well.

181
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,500
As you wish, I'll give you my full
course before executing you.

182
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,580
First, your leg.

183
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:56,340
My Demon-Sweeper Low Kick crushes bone,
so you'll never be able to stand again.

184
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,340
Next, your torso.

185
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:03,550
After my Bear-Killer Mid
Kick and Carnage Punch...

186
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,680
your arm will break,
and your guts will go flying.

187
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,020
Lastly, your head...

188
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,270
My Hell-Bringin' Hand Chop
will split your skull,

189
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,920
so you can kiss this world goodb—

190
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,570
Don't touch my head!

191
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,680
Uh... Out of bounds...

192
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,850
Crap. I missed out on the
actual fighting part again.

193
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,910
The match is over! Someone get a stretcher!

194
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,710
What an absolutely stunning upset!

195
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:36,530
The one who defeated Bakuzan,
who was favored to win this tournament,

196
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,730
was Charanko, who is competing
here for the first time!

197
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,050
He finished him in one punch again.

198
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,310
Okay, then. I guess I'll do that, too.

199
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:52,480
Mr. Ignoramus is here to explain
the recent monster outbreak.

200
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:58,360
Mr. Ignoramus, what are your thoughts
on the recent outbreak of monsters?

201
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,860
Monster Expert
Ignoramus

202
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,860
Nothing?

203
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,820
Oh, we've just received new information.

204
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:12,040
The Class A hero Lightning Genji was
critically injured and has collapsed.

205
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,040
Hero
Guide

206
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,710
What do you think about this?

207
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,150
I see that you're speechless.

208
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,800
Critically Injured

209
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,800
Hey!

210
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,670
Hey, wake up!

211
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,010
Ow...

212
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,550
Are you all right, Mohican?

213
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,010
There should have been a
father and a son here.

214
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,290
Do you know where the son went?

215
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:35,480
Waganma

216
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:35,480
Narinki

217
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:35,480
Mr. Narinki's son, Wanganma,
was kidnapped by monsters.

218
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,290
What?! But why?

219
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:44,110
We're not sure, but Mr. Narinki's
contributions cover 7% of our expenses,

220
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:47,040
so we cannot lose his trust.

221
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,400
Right. Getting Waganma back
safely takes top priority.

222
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,000
Gather all heroes at Class A and up!

223
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,020
But...

224
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,380
Are you saying to ignore all the
monsters rampaging through the cities?

225
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:04,220
The Class S hero Metal Bat has been found
critically injured and unconscious.

226
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,340
Come on, now. What's wrong?

227
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,350
You can't hit me like that.

228
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,600
I can't get a good shot at him...

229
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,830
Where are you looking?
I'm right over here!

230
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,240
It's not just that he's fast...

231
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,820
My eyes can't keep up with his unusual
movements, and he slips between buildings.

232
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,150
You leave me no choice.

233
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,700
I didn't want to use this, but...

234
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:38,560
Oh? Do you still have something
else up your sleeve?

235
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,800
Are you going to shoot laser
beams from your eyes?

236
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:46,930
I didn't even want to equip myself
with this, but Dr. Kuseno was right.

237
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,680
Tracking missiles? Poisonous gas?

238
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:55,770
I will not grow if I cannot
face superior opponents.

239
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:59,310
It's not pesticide, is it?

240
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,650
Wh-What the...

241
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,900
My legs! This is...

242
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,530
It's an instantaneous
super-strength adhesive.

243
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:13,030
Even if a super-fast ninja attacks me,
I can take them out in an instant.

244
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,870
But by using this, I'm basically
acknowledging how fast he is.

245
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,370
What are you talking about?!

246
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,570
I guess this doesn't concern you.

247
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,840
Incinerate.

248
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,740
Did he leave his feet behind and flee?

249
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,330
Either way, he's critically injured.

250
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:41,050
I guess I can head back to the stadium.

251
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,440
I might make it back in
time for Master's match.

252
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,060
Something's approaching at high speed...

253
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:50,240
Is it the cockroach? No...
This is something different.

254
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:02,290
Hey... You're not supposed to fall
under her control so easily!

255
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,850
You're so cute when you're panicked.

256
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:09,220
Too bad for you,
but they're all my slaves now.

257
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,970
How does it feel to have your
subordinates taken from you?

258
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,930
Come on, you'd better fight back.

259
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,850
You must be holding back.

260
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:24,690
In that case, I'll let you join
them as one of my slaves!

261
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,860
You're not gonna survive like that.

262
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,280
Shut up!

263
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,060
Wow, you hold up against
these numbers quite well.

264
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,750
But I wonder how long you can keep that up!

265
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:50,260
Here we go! I'm going to lash you to pieces!

266
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,140
She's feeling that.

267
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,560
Now you're mine.

268
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,400
By the way, you're one of the
Psychic Sisters, aren't you?

269
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,780
In other words, your little sister is
the Class S hero Terrible Tornado.

270
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:14,570
Meaning if I use you as bait,
I can lure Tornado out.

271
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,950
Good thing your little sister's so special.

272
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,750
She hasn't lost her senses to my whip?

273
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:32,860
Her will is so strong... I think I hate her.

274
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,510
That hurt, you stupid bitch!

275
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:44,010
I was going to use you to lure out
your little sister, but forget that!

276
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,010
I'll rip you to shreds right now!

277
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,190
You don't have to lure her out.
My older sister will come.

278
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,320
What's this shaking?

279
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,810
I guess she was closer than I thought.

280
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:59,450
She can sense when I've sustained damage.

281
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:00,910
She's coming.

282
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,620
Explosions?!

283
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,620
Something's coming nearer.

284
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,920
Something terrible!

285
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,550
She's coming.

286
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,910
Terrible Tornado.

287
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,180
S-Super S...

288
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:23,930
There's an insane monster
on the hero side, too...

289
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,330
She's even worse than I thought.

290
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:28,500
She destroyed... us all...

291
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,730
I should probably get out of here...

292
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,190
There she is.

293
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,240
Big Sis! I-I haven't lost ye—

294
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,380
Go on home already, Blizzard.

295
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,120
I'll clean up your mess.

296
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,210
S-Slaves! Buy me time to run away!

297
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,860
Wait! They're on our side!
Please don't attack them!

298
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,010
I just asked you to not attack them...

299
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,970
I wouldn't call this an attack.

300
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,410
Uh, that was definitely an attack.

301
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:08,870
Also, I wouldn't say they're on our side.
They're just a hindrance.

302
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:12,230
I'm surprised you still had that
Class B club thing going on.

303
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,360
Ugh, she escaped.

304
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,220
I probably shouldn't waste time here talking

305
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,030
since there are apparently other monsters.

306
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,710
Could you tell your flunkies

307
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:27,850
that they're just in the way,
so they should probably just run?

308
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:39,010
I'd be denying my own worth,
so I was trying not to think about it...

309
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:43,100
But this isn't good.
I'm thinking about it again.

310
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:47,850
I want to eat you!
I want to eat human flesh!

311
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,580
Hold it right there!

312
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:54,570
Now that I, Snakebite Snek, am here,
I won't let you hurt anyone else!

313
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:58,530
I was shining so brightly back then.

314
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:02,320
I was someone special who had
the power to protect the masses.

315
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,740
The fact that I was a real
hero fulfilled my spirit.

316
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,250
But over time, I began to
see reality a bit clearer.

317
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:14,490
There were creatures out there I couldn't
defeat, no matter how much I struggled.

318
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:19,880
There were even nameless civilians
out there that I couldn't defeat.

319
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:23,530
Are pro heroes actually necessary?

320
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,870
I find myself asking that a lot lately.

321
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,390
Maybe even if I didn't exist...

322
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,940
Even if the Hero Association didn't exist...

323
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:35,400
There'd still be someone else
to defeat the monsters.

324
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:40,990
If anything, this man definitely doesn't
seem like he'd need me to protect him.

325
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:44,370
That Max guy earlier had a little more oomph.

326
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:48,120
Why do you just keep dodging?
Why not attack?

327
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,750
I wanted to at least confirm your abilities.

328
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:55,250
Class A heroes get a pretty
high salary, don't they?

329
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,710
If someone at your level can
do it, it might be a decent job.

330
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:02,090
Just kidding. I'd just want the money.

331
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,340
Why are you so strong?

332
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:09,930
You're frivolous and lack all ambition.

333
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,310
Maybe it's just pure talent.

334
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,630
You really piss me off.

335
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:19,730
When I was training, I'd just
randomly spar with my master.

336
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,200
But I haven't even trained
the last couple of years.

337
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:27,410
Why do you bother being a hero?
I mean, at your skill level...

338
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,160
Wh-What?!

339
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,070
There are many more
powerful monsters lately.

340
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:35,290
Is there even a reason
for you to try anymore?

341
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:40,100
Even if there weren't any heroes, the people
who could survive would still survive.

342
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,930
The weak are weeded out,
whether we have monsters or not.

343
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,140
That's how nature works.

344
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,810
So you're saying that we should just
let the monsters kill people?!

345
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:51,470
What's going on?!

346
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,050
Is this part of the show?

347
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:54,930
Monsters!

348
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,900
Hero Association Hospital

349
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:55,900
Inside the hospital?!

350
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,500
We'll hold them back!
Everyone, get to the roof!

351
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,610
Bottom of Foot

352
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:03,090
Despite that, we survive.

353
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,570
What the hell does a monster want at a jail?

354
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,570
The boss escaped from jail
to defeat some monsters!

355
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:11,130
So Puri-Puri Prisoner isn't here?

356
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,790
Oh, well.

357
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,790
Who are you saying will survive?

358
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,250
The strong.

359
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,840
Super big

360
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,840
Big winner!!

361
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,590
What—

362
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,340
This is what I'm talking about.

363
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,970
Sounds exciting out there.

364
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:06,940
Well, Gyoro-Gyoro, are the monsters
we sent forth wreaking havoc?

365
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:12,830
Yes. We've lost some, but it appears
that we still remain dominant.

366
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,620
The Hero Association is panicking.

367
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,950
What is Goketsu doing?

368
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,530
It seems he's heading toward
an event venue where

369
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,540
there's a martial arts tournament going on.

370
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:31,220
So far, our big victories include Demon
Cyborg, Metal Bat, and Metal Knight.

371
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:35,720
And we still have our
main forces on standby.

372
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,310
Victory is certain for the
Monster Association,

373
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:42,590
Monster King Orochi.

374
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:50,250
Class S Heroes
