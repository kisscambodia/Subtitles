1
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,900
Master, where should we head next?

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:12,520
Hair

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,930
Let's see... We bought the ingredients
for the hot pot, right?

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,110
That just leaves toilet
paper and shampoo...

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,110
Rumble

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,860
Rumble

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:19,870
Huh...

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,710
I guess you get one of these
when you get popular.

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,250
Must be nice... Getting your own figure.

10
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,850
Let's contact the manufacturer.

11
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,980
Nah... You're not supposed to
ask them to make one yourself.

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,880
Let's go.

13
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,740
Yes, sir!

14
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,430
Where should we go, Master?

15
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,060
What the heck is that?!

16
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,070
I loved reptiles so much
that I turned into one.

17
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,960
I'm Tongue-Stretcher!

18
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,760
Run away!

19
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,830
I'm not letting any of you girls get away!

20
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,580
You're mine! Yummy!

21
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,030
Licky, licky, licky!

22
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,830
Jeez, that startled me!

23
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,170
Th-This vibe...

24
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,170
That face!

25
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,670
Rumble

26
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,680
H-He's no ordinary guy!

27
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,260
Man... I want to quit being a hero.

28
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,680
That guy's the strongest hero in the world!

29
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,730
It's King!

30
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,810
I knew I saw you somewhere!
You're the legendary...

31
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,440
He'll stomp you in a single blow!

32
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,570
Can I have your autograph?

33
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,240
King! King!

34
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,740
King! King! King! King! King! King! King!

35
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,950
I-I-I'm terribly sorry for what I've done!

36
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,330
Three cheers for King!

37
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,940
You pervert!

38
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,040
You're the worst.

39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,870
Take care of him, Mr. King!

40
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,790
King! King! King! King!

41
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,790
How did it come to this?

42
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,960
He's starting to have a seizure
while he's groveling!

43
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,290
You're so awesome, King.

44
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,030
Did you show up because you
sensed the monster, King?

45
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,840
No, I was about to go shopp—

46
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,540
Hey, you can't just talk
to King like that.

47
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,930
Er, I don't really mind.

48
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,180
Could I just get a handshake?

49
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,760
I'm busy.

50
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,940
Would you mind leaving me alone?

51
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,580
W-We're terribly sorry!

52
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,500
Let's go! Let's go!

53
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,890
Video Game Shop
Pazool

54
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,100
Thank you very much.

55
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,680
I was able to buy it.

56
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,310
Heartthrob Sisters 2

57
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,330
The first-press limited edition
of Heartthrob Sisters 2.

58
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,810
I can never get enough of the excitement

59
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,290
I feel as I walk home
after buying a new game.

60
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,260
I can't wait to get home and play.

61
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,240
Class S Rank 7

62
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,240
King

63
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,460
Master, I believe that
gentleman is King after all.

64
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,930
Who?

65
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,640
He was one of the heroes
at the Class S gathering.

66
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,350
The first sequel in three
and a half years...

67
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,480
I'm feeling the hype!

68
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,720
The Hero's Return

69
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,720
Café

70
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,230
King.

71
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:59,150
That man somehow claims your place
as the strongest man in the world.

72
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,870
Ah...

73
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,060
But what in the world is he doing here?

74
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,430
A-A monster!

75
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,560
A monster?

76
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,170
Master, we should hurry!

77
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,410
No, wait...

78
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,400
This might be a good opportunity
to see King's true power.

79
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,300
Let's see how things go.

80
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:25,550
I am G4! A machine god that
the organization created.

81
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,590
You're the Class S hero King, aren't you?

82
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,270
I will eliminate you.

83
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,600
Look! It's King! King's right over there!

84
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,300
You're aware that I'm King...

85
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,640
A Class S Rank 7 hero,
and the strongest man on Earth?

86
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,120
I'm saying that I've come to kill you!

87
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,380
What the heck's that noise?

88
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,000
You've never heard of the King Engine?

89
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,780
It's the sound you hear once
King's in combat mode!

90
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,300
It's said that there's been no monster that
made it out alive after hearing that sound!

91
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,700
Listen well. This is also
a test of my combat AI.

92
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,260
I need you to fight at full
strength so I can gather data.

93
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,850
Is this thing a robot?

94
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,180
What the hell is this organization?

95
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,520
I have no idea what it's talking about.

96
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,070
All right, but let me go
to the bathroom first.

97
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,530
I'll only be able to fight at about
half-strength if I'm holding it in.

98
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,450
That won't give you accurate data, will it?

99
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,330
I shall wait here for ten minutes.

100
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,290
For every minute that you're late,
I shall kill ten people.

101
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,500
Got it?

102
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,400
That monster seems pretty strong.

103
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,840
That thing is a robot... and quite powerful.

104
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,640
It's performance might be
higher than mine.

105
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,800
I estimate that it's at least threat level
Demon and will be quite troublesome.

106
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:53,070
I wonder how King will fight it.

107
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,420
Public Bathroom

108
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,400
It came to kill me?

109
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,900
How did things end up like this?!

110
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,060
I'm scared... I'm so scared!

111
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,190
I'm not strong!

112
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,660
I'm a 29-year-old unemployed
otaku and antisocial loser!

113
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,030
What the hell is the "King Engine"?!

114
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,740
Rumble

115
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:13,980
Are they stupid?!

116
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,670
I'm just twice, no, dozens of times
more cowardly than other people!

117
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,900
An evil monster just happened
to appear in front of me once

118
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,000
and someone defeated it
while I had my eyes closed.

119
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,430
That coincidentally happened
over and over again!

120
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,470
That's all it is!

121
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,810
But then the Hero Association
sent me a Class S certificate,

122
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,650
saying that I was the ultimate rookie.

123
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,020
I mean, it's also my fault
because I didn't deny it,

124
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,520
but I never thought it'd come to this!

125
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,140
Aw, man... I want to quit
being a hero so bad.

126
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:55,790
It's starting!

127
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,920
Think! Think about how to get through this!

128
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,360
I can't!

129
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,450
It's not like my name's
gonna intimidate a robot!

130
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,800
I'm sorry!

131
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,010
I'm so sorry!

132
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,230
Someone's fighting it?

133
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,650
I'm saved!

134
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,370
What is that? A rocket punch?

135
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,900
Genos, want me to lend you a hand?

136
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,740
No.

137
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,880
In order for me to achieve your

138
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,210
assignment to me and rank
in the top ten of Class S,

139
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,130
I need to be able to

140
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,640
defeat something like this on my own!

141
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,930
I see.

142
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,140
Well, see ya. Make sure you don't lose.

143
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,860
Emergency evacuation warning.

144
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,980
A robotic weapon is rampaging
near Central Park in City M.

145
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,490
Residents of the area should
immediately evacuate.

146
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,680
I somehow made it home safely, but...

147
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:19,120
That scary robot is probably
going to haunt my dreams.

148
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,230
I'll just play some games
and try to forget about it.

149
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:33,010
They put so much work into the openings
of the Heartthrob Sisters series.

150
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:35,140
I can barely contain my excitement.

151
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,640
Input your name, Big Brother!

152
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,930
My name, huh?

153
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,270
It'd be too embarrassing
to use my actual name.

154
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,310
I wonder what I should use.

155
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,310
Why not just use King?

156
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,390
Yeah, I'm not sure about using my hero name.

157
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,150
I mean, having someone call me
"Big Brother King" is just...

158
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,940
Huh?

159
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,320
Um... What? Who the hell is this guy?

160
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,120
What are they doing here?

161
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,540
Your window was open.

162
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,500
We're on the 22nd floor.

163
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,790
C-Come on, man.

164
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,550
You can't just come in here uninvited!

165
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,510
Ahem.

166
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,720
D-Do you know that I'm a Class S hero?

167
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,980
Of course, I do. You're King, right?

168
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:27,240
Th-This guy is the Class B hero that was at
the Class S hero meeting for some reason!

169
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,130
Could I get some tea?

170
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,130
I had no idea you were interested
in games like this, though.

171
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,160
Input your name, Big Brother!

172
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,330
Stop!

173
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,440
Hey, what game is this?

174
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,420
It looks fun.

175
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,740
Battle Robot
Galgangal

176
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,390
Oh, that's an action game.

177
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,750
You operate a robot and stuff?

178
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,500
Yeah, exactly!

179
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:46,620
I see.

180
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,040
That's the kind of game I'm really into!

181
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,670
I bought this thinking it was an action game,
but what the heck? It's a dating sim!

182
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,300
I guess I bought it by mistake!

183
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,590
It totally says Heartthrob Sisters.

184
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,020
Seriously?! I totally thought
it said "Wrathful Shooters"!

185
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,660
Damn, they tricked me! I'll throw it away!

186
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,890
Then let's play this one.

187
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,960
Yeah! That's a great idea!
That one's... Er, wait...

188
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,640
You wanna play that?

189
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,150
What? I can't? I mean,
you've got time, right?

190
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,100
Who the hell is this guy?

191
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,410
He's only a Class B, but he's super
pushy and way too casual with me.

192
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,350
Not to mention, I'm older here!

193
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,410
Incinerate!

194
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,750
I've melted your internal structures.

195
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,090
Your big body brought upon your downfall.

196
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,350
The pilot? No... Its true form?

197
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:48,530
Not good!

198
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,570
Whoa, King. You're super
good at video games.

199
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:59,290
I mean... I've won a few tournaments
for some fighting games, but...

200
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,700
Really?

201
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,200
So not only are you strong in real life,
you're a winner in video games, too?

202
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,500
How long does he plan on being here?

203
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,390
Hurry up and—

204
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,460
So, why did you run away earlier?

205
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,750
Right now, Genos is fighting in your place.

206
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,220
You're a super strong Class S hero, right?

207
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:19,680
Why did you run away from
the robot monster then?

208
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:24,350
I came here to ask you that,
but you were playing video games.

209
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:28,100
Did you get bored with the monster?

210
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,310
Could it be that you're so strong that
you don't want to fight anymore?

211
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,780
Please, tell me.

212
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,450
Emergency evacuation warning.

213
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,000
A giant bird has appeared above City M.

214
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,780
Threat level Demon.

215
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,770
Please do not go outside.

216
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,770
Here we go again.

217
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,240
I repeat...

218
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,210
That's the third warning just today.

219
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,290
What are you going to do? I'm gonna go.

220
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,050
Well, I'll be damned.

221
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,370
Guess the threat decided
to come right to you.

222
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,570
Maybe there's something about
you that attracts monsters.

223
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:11,650
Yeah... I've always been super unlucky.

224
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,190
What do you do in situations like this?

225
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,440
But lately, it's been getting worse.

226
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,490
I mean, if these things are showing up at
your house, you have to fight, don't you?

227
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,950
Damn it... I have to do
something about these lasers!

228
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,880
Come down.

229
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,010
My only target is King. I have
no time to waste on you.

230
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,340
Come on, God, give me a break!

231
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,140
That one time, then that other time,

232
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,310
and then that other time!

233
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,270
I just got dragged into those messes!

234
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,810
I'm always running away.

235
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,220
Eventually, someone'll
show up to defeat them.

236
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,240
I just happened to be at those places,

237
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,150
but everyone ends up thinking I'm
the one who defeated those things!

238
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,790
I've never even been in a fight!

239
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,120
King...

240
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,470
I ended up with this hero name because
they thought I was the ultimate hero

241
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,540
and my overwhelming strength...

242
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,320
What a joke.

243
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,260
I'm basically nothing but lies.

244
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,680
Oh?

245
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:36,810
That's—

246
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,000
Why you little...

247
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,920
The steam is—

248
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,160
It appears that you're after King,

249
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,400
but I know someone that's stronger.

250
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,880
You not gonna fight, King?

251
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,520
You've got the wrong idea!

252
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,180
I'm not the King that society
looks up to so much!

253
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,570
I have to say it! I have to say it!

254
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,700
If I don't say it now, he's—

255
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,140
I'm actually—

256
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:29,340
Seriously? So your strength and
battle history are all lies?

257
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:34,710
I guess it must be true if you
pissed your pants over that bird.

258
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,100
Wait, why are you just standing there?
What happened to the bird?

259
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,210
He... What?

260
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,420
You okay?

261
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,090
Someone! Someone!

262
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,980
Hey, calm down. I defeated the monster.

263
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,280
Is your eye okay?

264
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,590
Try opening it slowly.

265
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,250
Can you see?

266
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,990
Wh-Who are you?

267
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,480
Me?

268
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,740
Hm...

269
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,160
I guess I'm just a guy who's
aspiring to be a hero for fun.

270
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,880
You're so hurt...

271
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,890
This is nothing.

272
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,730
Today was a great victory.

273
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,980
This guy is...

274
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,700
Hey, what's the matter? Hey!

275
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,390
I'm so sorry!

276
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,730
Are you having fun?

277
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,350
Being a hero who lies and cowers in fear?

278
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,200
No...

279
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,930
I mean, it's none of my business, so I'm
not going to lecture you or anything.

280
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,590
But, uh... I may have been taking
credit for your deeds.

281
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:58,000
This isn't about that.

282
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,100
You're everyone's hero.

283
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,460
No, I'm...

284
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:07,460
No matter what you think, they think
that you're the ultimate hero.

285
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,450
Rumble

286
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,830
King, are you going to
continue with your lies?

287
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,100
Or are you going to quit being a hero?

288
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,920
I'm not sure...

289
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,030
In that case,

290
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,840
why don't you just get strong?

291
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,310
Huh?

292
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,190
I'm going now.

293
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,270
See ya.

294
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,990
Wait!

295
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,040
Aren't you angry with me?

296
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:30,490
You worked so hard to become
a hero, and yet, I...

297
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,500
I'll be coming by now and
then to play some games.

298
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,780
Peace.

299
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,190
Oh!

300
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,160
Uh...

301
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,250
Sure.

302
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:48,380
Dr. Kuseno, these are parts from a
robot calling itself the Robot God G4.

303
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,490
It had immense power and superb AI.

304
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:56,140
If there are any parts from it that
I can use, please allow me to do so.

305
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:00,760
Th-This is... Genos, where did you get this?

306
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,250
Doctor,

307
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,560
I want to get stronger.

308
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,070
All right. Let's give it a try.

309
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:11,520
I believe I can still make you stronger.

310
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,700
Thank you.

311
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:18,270
But, Genos, while I know you became a
cyborg for the sake of justice,

312
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,300
you shouldn't push yourself too hard.

313
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,870
No, I have to push myself.

314
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:27,090
Right now, I'm trying to rank
in the top ten of Class S.

315
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,390
That reckless assignment
your master assigned you?

316
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,970
I figured you'd say that.

317
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,520
More importantly, Genos, have you
gathered any clues about the cyborg?

318
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,560
That rampaging cyborg
that destroyed your home?

319
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,510
You seem to be completely focused
on your hero activities lately.

320
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,740
I haven't been able to track it down at all.

321
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,220
I see... But—

322
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:00,290
The rampaging cyborg that's destroyed
many towns and taken countless lives...

323
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,160
I will track it down, no matter what,

324
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:06,040
and destroy it with my own hands.

325
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,630
No matter what. Whatever it takes.

326
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:12,020
Despite becoming a hero
and gaining a master,

327
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,340
it appears that his hatred
hasn't disappeared.

328
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:18,640
Genos, I'm worried.

329
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,000
I've been pursuing this
cyborg longer than you,

330
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,440
and I know just how dangerous it is.

331
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:31,860
If you do end up finding it, don't do
anything rash and report back to me.

332
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:38,640
You are calm and intelligent,
but your youth can invite disaster.

333
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,780
Do not fight it alone.

334
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,910
Doctor Kuseno, I understand.

335
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,090
This is our fight.

336
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:56,750
I am Sitch, the leader of Earth in the Danger
Prophecy Emergency Countermeasures Team.

337
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,380
I am deeply grateful that denizens

338
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:03,100
of the underworld like yourselves
would heed our call.

339
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,290
Let me just say

340
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:09,650
that we will not be looking into your
criminal history or activities at this time.

341
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,260
This is not a trap.

342
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,320
There are a few heroes here, but they
are just serving as my bodyguards.

343
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,980
Heroes?

344
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,710
Bring them on! I'll murder all of them!

345
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:23,800
They won't act as long as you
don't do anything reckless.

346
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,580
Why don't we just take over the place?

347
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,360
Wanted men with huge
bounties and top assassins.

348
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,930
Even prison escapees.

349
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,930
What is Sitch thinking,
inviting these ruffians here?

350
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,910
Magicman

351
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,910
Class A Rank 7

352
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,530
I don't know why he brought them here,

353
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,670
Class A Rank 5

354
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,670
Heavy Tank Loincloth

355
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,680
but the nerve these criminals
had to actually show up...

356
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,640
I'll burn them to cinders if they make
even the slightest suspicious move.

357
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,630
Class A Rank 6

358
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,630
Blue Fire

359
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:54,330
Three upper-rank Class A heroes,
whose fighting power is close to Class S.

360
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:58,220
No one here is stupid enough to
lose control in front of them.

361
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,740
All right, let's begin.

362
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,410
Wait.

363
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:05,030
Where's the hero named Saitama?

364
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,160
Doesn't he live in these headquarters?

365
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,830
Who are you?

366
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,160
I'd appreciate it if we could hold off
on anything off topic until later.

367
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,460
This is rather important.

368
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,470
He isn't here? Then I'm leaving.

369
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,090
You're going to leave without
hearing what he has to say?

370
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,720
I won't let that happen,
now that you're here.

371
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:28,440
Level Tiger or higher disasters
are happening more often lately.

372
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,980
This month, the rate is six times
the last three years' average.

373
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:38,180
Are these omens of the danger
foretold by the great Shibabwa,

374
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:40,600
The Earth Is in Danger Prophecy Emergency Countermeasures Team
Explanation Meeting

375
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,610
or has it already begun?

376
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,920
If this continues,

377
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,410
the current heroes will be exhausted
and unable to deal with the disasters.

378
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:50,960
The prophecy said the greatest
disaster in history will occur

379
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,290
within six months, and clearly,
it hasn't passed.

380
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,280
The Earth is in Danger Prophecy Emergency Countermeasures Team
Explanation Meeting

381
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,950
Even Class S heroes are dealing
with some of these incidents,

382
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:02,090
but there are so many disasters happening,
there aren't enough heroes to go around.

383
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:08,850
In other words, in the increasingly intense
fights to save humanity that lie ahead

384
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:13,190
you want help from both the good and bad,

385
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,900
as long as they know how to fight.

386
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,400
Does that pretty much sum it up?

387
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,070
Well, I still refuse.

388
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,570
H-How did he get his hands on
papers I never even  handed out?

389
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:29,200
The thought of playing hero with you losers

390
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,210
nauseates me.

391
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,800
Damn it. What a waste of time.

392
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,130
This was a great opportunity for outsiders
to enter the Hero Association HQ,

393
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:48,140
but all I know about him are his name,
his face, and that he's Class B Rank 33.

394
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,850
Hero Name
Saitama

395
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,850
Hero Rank
Class B Rank 33

396
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,850
Seriously? A guy like him?

397
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,350
Unbelievable.

398
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,650
Yes.

399
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:58,310
In the physical exam
portion of the Hero Test,

400
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,780
he crushed every record for every event.

401
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,760
Lady Blizzard!

402
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,310
Class B Rank 1

403
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,310
Hellish Blizzard

404
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,900
No trespassing

405
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,910
Despite having no notable record
of his actions since then,

406
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,960
he managed to climb up
from Class C to Class B.

407
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,580
Right after his debut, on top of that.

408
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,290
There has to be something about this man.

409
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
There has to be something about him.

410
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,460
A secret behind his strength.

411
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,730
First, we're going to find out where he is.

412
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:24,630
Yes, ma'am!

413
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,720
I'm going to hunt him down,
and I'm going to make him regret

414
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,730
the fact that he managed to embarrass
me, Sound-o'-Speed Sonic.

415
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,850
Just you wait...

416
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,120
You better be prepared...

417
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,040
...Saitama!

418
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,380
Hey, why are you taking all the items?

419
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,640
What the hell, man?

420
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,220
First come, first serve.

421
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,920
This is co-op, you moron.
You friggin' moron, King.

422
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,860
I'm still in my default gear!

423
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,080
Don't worry. I can beat them by myself.

424
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:59,310
Whoops. The controller broke.

425
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,220
Huh?

426
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,210
The Earth is in Danger Prophecy Emergency Countermeasures Team
Explanation Meeting

427
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,890
There better be a reward for this.

428
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,520
Hey, come on now.

429
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,960
This great prophecy's pretty insane.

430
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:51,150
Human Monster
