1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:04,230
You've been having things
your way for a while...

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,190
But your reign ends here.

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:09,760
Take that, and that, and that!

4
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:11,320
Ogre

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,050
Consecutive low, weak kicks! This is a
strategy I figured out so you can't escape!

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,820
Good grief. You just don't get it.

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,060
Home

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,290
If you want to trap someone...

9
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,330
this is how you do it.

10
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:29,500
Take this!

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,550
K.O.!

12
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,220
Dokishisu

13
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,220
Home

14
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,330
Bunny bun bun!

15
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,550
One more time!

16
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,430
K.O.!

17
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,600
K.O.!

18
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,640
K.O.!

19
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,870
K.O.!

20
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,700
Bunny bun bun!

21
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,390
This is shit! This game is shit!

22
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,200
That's all he could say

23
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,080
The heck is this?

24
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:10,250
Oh, those were distributed
to a handful of heroes.

25
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,590
It's apparently still a prototype, though.

26
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,180
It's a terminal for receiving backup requests
and the latest intel immediately.

27
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,290
I didn't get one.

28
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:20,060
Huh?

29
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:26,450
Oh... Maybe they think you can't
handle buttons and stuff very well.

30
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,150
One more time!

31
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,220
Next time, I'm going to use even faster
consecutive low, weak kicks and win!

32
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,290
A message has arrived from
the Monster Association!

33
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,080
A message has arrived from
the Monster Association!

34
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,090
He's been taken over by some parasite!

35
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,960
Call all the resident heroes!

36
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,380
Hello? This is the west wing,
floor 2, conference room 7!

37
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,380
Should I shoot?

38
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,610
Yes, shoot!

39
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,380
Wait!

40
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,530
Listen to the message!

41
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:31,520
The Encircling Net of Justice

42
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,940
It's a pleasure to meet you, ladies and
gentlemen of the Hero Association.

43
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,110
I am Gyoro-Gyoro, an officer
in the Monster Association.

44
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:41,230
As you already know, we have the son of one
of your top executives in our custody.

45
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,450
What are your demands?

46
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,700
We have but one request.

47
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,350
We are tired of being oppressed
just because we're monsters,

48
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,350
so we ask that you leave us alone.

49
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,820
We are currently hiding in
an abandoned part of City Z,

50
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,350
where we monsters help each other out
while we try to make ends meet.

51
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:03,910
We would never ask for something as
luxurious as living freely in the outside world.

52
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:10,770
We will never attack another civilian again,
nor intrude upon your way of life.

53
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:16,440
All we ask for in return
is our own sanctuary.

54
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,440
Our dream is the realization
of a society in which

55
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,980
humans and monsters can
live together in harmony.

56
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,610
Then why did you insist on rampaging?

57
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,070
By showing you our power,

58
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:32,980
we thought you'd find that you could benefit
from agreeing to this idea, as well.

59
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,290
I'm sure we want to avoid any
further casualties on either side.

60
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:40,130
So they're asking for a cease-fire.
Just like I thought they would.

61
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,050
Very well.

62
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:46,260
We promise that we will not engage the
Monster Association from here on out.

63
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,220
So you should release your
hostage immediately.

64
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,880
You stupid monsters better enjoy
this brief moment of peace.

65
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,020
We're going to take you down before
you can grow any stron—

66
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,010
Whoops. My finger slipped.

67
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:05,150
Come, now. We're still in the middle
of negotiations, Destrochloridium.

68
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,910
My bad. I need to work on my patience.

69
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,320
He killed him!

70
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,750
Do you really have any
intention to negotiate?

71
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,150
It's so fun to mess with you adults.

72
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,780
Humans and monsters living in harmony?

73
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,670
I think that's my best joke yet!

74
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,140
You people are even dumber than I thought

75
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,420
if you were going to accept
that demand so quickly.

76
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,090
What do you plan to do with the hostage?!

77
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,430
Don't tell me you already—

78
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,560
Oh, he's still alive.

79
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,230
We took a hostage so you
cowards couldn't run away.

80
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,270
We'll give you just three days.

81
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:46,820
In that time, gather your strongest
heroes and come rescue the brat!

82
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:52,150
Lord Orochi and the rest of the
Monster Association will be waiting for you.

83
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,160
It self-destructed?

84
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,540
There's still one more left!
Where are the heroes?

85
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,620
Are we done talking?

86
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,500
In that case...

87
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,940
I can go crazy now, right?!

88
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,390
Class S Rank 11
Superalloy Blackluster

89
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,390
Was this the emergency
you guys called about?

90
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:15,810
Ah, Blackluster. Thank goodness we asked
you to stay here to defend headquarters.

91
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,340
No! It's not over yet!

92
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,560
That thing's a parasite!
It's true form's out now!

93
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,560
You guys are way too slow.

94
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:27,420
This Class S hero's body is mine!

95
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:32,100
His body's as hard as steel! My drills—

96
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,390
Impossible! This is just skin, isn't it?!

97
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,080
What are you talking about?

98
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,550
Of course you don't stand a chance.
My skin's toughened by steel.

99
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,520
The Monster Association must
be extremely confident.

100
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,340
What do we do?

101
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,920
What do you mean? Our plan from
the start was to rescue the hostage!

102
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,260
You're okay with sending our Class S
heroes in, knowing it's a trap?!

103
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,880
Well, this isn't good.

104
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:01,000
The executives are actually panicking
over the Monster Association.

105
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,380
I should just...

106
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,360
Ahem.

107
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:05,940
Eyes over here!

108
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,260
How's that?

109
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,230
H-How's what, Blackluster?

110
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,530
Have you calmed down a little
after staring at my muscles?

111
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,620
We, uh...

112
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,830
We should be just as confident.

113
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:21,830
Huh?

114
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,920
It appears the time has come
when I can truly shine.

115
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,090
I'm more worried about the enemy.

116
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,340
I'm hoping I can at least
go all-out on them.

117
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,430
You think the heroes will show?

118
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:39,470
Well, you saw what happened today.
We're way stronger.

119
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,280
We can probably attack all at once and

120
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,690
not even have to worry about
using the hostage as bait.

121
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,540
Confidence is a good thing, but acting
on impulse always has its consequences.

122
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,730
It's true that the Hero Association
has its own kind of monsters.

123
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:56,200
Letting them go free will
cause problems later.

124
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,010
That's why we'll gather them all in
one place and strike them all at once.

125
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,120
This is what our hostage is for.

126
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,100
Once they lose all their forces,

127
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,090
we'll eradicate the rest
of the Hero Association.

128
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,950
After humanity loses the
ability to fight back,

129
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:14,340
they'll be helpless against us and have
no other choice but to go extinct.

130
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,340
And then,

131
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,300
Lord Orochi will become king,

132
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,680
and a world for just monsters
will finally become a reality!

133
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,850
What's the matter? Where's my applause?

134
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,990
Are you not satisfied serving Lord Orochi?

135
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,450
We just gathered here to
crush the Hero Association.

136
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,870
No one said anything about serving anyone.

137
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,610
What's this? What's a loser doing here?

138
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,410
Wh-What are you doing?!

139
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,850
What are you doing here, Roach Awakening?

140
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,630
You have some nerve, showing up after you lost.

141
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,380
Wait! I just lost my feet!

142
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,590
I can still fight!

143
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,030
Next time, I'll—

144
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,590
Hey, we're friends, aren't we?

145
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,490
Hey! No...

146
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,140
Please don't! Don't do it!

147
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,470
Please don't do this!

148
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:03,460
Don't—

149
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,420
He ate him!

150
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,730
That goes for you as well, Super S.

151
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,660
But I'm still... I barely have a scratch on me!

152
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,410
I didn't actually lose!

153
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:22,250
Well, her power can be quite useful,
so it might be worthwhile to let her live.

154
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,060
There won't be a next time.

155
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,000
Damn it...

156
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:31,300
Anyway, if any of you have a problem,

157
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,380
you can challenge Lord
Orochi yourselves later.

158
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:39,780
If you actually defeat Lord
Orochi, we'll have a new boss.

159
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,720
Very well.

160
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,620
By the way, Gyoro-Gyoro,
I don't see Goketsu anywhere.

161
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,230
Oh, dear.

162
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,250
It appears he hasn't returned yet.

163
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,220
I guess I'll go check things out.

164
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:02,700
Unbelievable...
Someone defeated Goketsu? But who?

165
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,660
I guess this won't go as
easily as planned after all.

166
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,150
Where am I?

167
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,630
Did someone take me out?

168
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,100
I need to get back to my hideout.

169
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,830
That's...

170
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:30,440
There's no doubt about it.
That's the Class A hero Death Gatling.

171
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,400
King got me way worse than I expected.

172
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,110
My body's actually at its limit.

173
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,450
Guess I'll just got home for today.

174
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,120
There we go.

175
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,210
How does it feel, Genos?

176
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,920
Looks like it'll work just fine.

177
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:58,130
Yes. Thank you, Dr. Kuseno,
for doing this on such short notice.

178
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:04,170
Well, I know you wanted to get
right back into the fight.

179
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:07,600
The changes should be easy to
manage, but with this upgrade,

180
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,740
you should definitely feel much stronger.

181
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,850
Yes. I won't lose again.

182
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,980
You don't have to be overconfident.
It's okay if you lose,

183
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,240
as long as you come back alive.

184
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:25,210
Seeing you yesterday reminded
me of my younger days.

185
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,580
I had a strong sense of
justice and continued forward

186
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,430
with absolutely no fear back then.

187
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,090
Genos, just make sure you
don't push yourself too hard.

188
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,130
Breaking news! Breaking news!

189
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:51,350
The Monsters Declare War
Monsters Infiltrate the Hero Association Headquarters Leaving 2 Employees Dead

190
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,870
The Monster Association?!

191
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,110
They infiltrated the headquarters? What?!

192
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,970
They even killed one of the executives?

193
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,350
Come on, you guys!

194
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,860
This morning, an organization calling
themselves the Monster Association

195
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:57,480
Monster Association

196
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:57,480
The Monster Association Declares War

197
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:00,460
made a criminal declaration that they had
taken a hostage from the Hero Association.

198
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,650
Big Bro Bat...

199
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,490
According to the declaration,
they expressed that even more destruction

200
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,870
Looks like the Hero Association and the
Monster Association are going to clash head-on.

201
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,860
and casualties would be
caused by the monsters.

202
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:10,380
A war? Curse the Monster
Association... How awful.

203
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,290
The Hero Association is calling
for extra security...

204
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,410
What's going to happen to us if they lose?

205
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:15,220
It sucks, but there's nothing we can do.

206
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,000
Damn it...

207
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,460
They can win... right? The heroes...

208
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,340
What do you mean, you're not going
to participate in the operation?!

209
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,850
Metal Knight! Don't you understand
what's going on right now?

210
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,510
Letting them provoke us
into infiltrating their base

211
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,670
will only cause more casualties.

212
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:35,020
I won't pointlessly help deal another
blow to the Hero Association's forces.

213
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,130
You don't need to say it like that!

214
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,410
They have a hostage!

215
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:44,280
That's the kind of thinking that
will make the situation worse.

216
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:49,850
If we've tracked down their base, we should
forget the operation to save the hostage

217
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,250
and just nuke the whole place.

218
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,820
I presented my idea to the Association,
but they turned it down.

219
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,970
Apparently they're more concerned
about their financial situation.

220
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:05,090
Meaning I won't have anything
to do with this operation.

221
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:08,570
And there he goes...
I swear, he's like a little kid!

222
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,100
The Monster Association Declares War

223
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:14,060
The masses want to know
what our next move is.

224
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,550
Those bastards leaked this to
the press... Unbelievable.

225
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:20,320
Now that the world knows of the
Hero Association's blunder,

226
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,440
we need to show the world
just how ready we are.

227
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,320
Monster Association

228
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,320
The Monster Association, eh?

229
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,030
They didn't state their location,
but I've got a pretty good idea.

230
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,410
It's in City Z.

231
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,410
City Z's hazardous area ahead
Absolutely no trespassing

232
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,450
They're planning to start a revolution.

233
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:39,580
This wasn't a message just for the humans.

234
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,400
It was to summon us.

235
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,800
Let's join the Monster Association.

236
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,550
Let's mess those heroes up!

237
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,840
There sure are a lot of
monsters out again today.

238
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,310
Did they actually come here to see me?

239
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,810
More importantly...

240
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:59,710
The garbage truck is gonna
show up any second!

241
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:01,770
What?

242
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,560
Someone's in our secret base?

243
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,570
Yeah. Some guy I didn't know
was sleeping in there.

244
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:09,910
Seriously?

245
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,300
Tareo, go check it out.

246
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,300
What?!

247
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,910
Tell him what's up, then kick him out.

248
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,610
I-I can't do that!

249
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,750
Shut up, and just go!

250
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,580
Ow...

251
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,680
My fever's not going down.

252
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:36,020
At this rate, I might not be able to
move much for the next couple of days.

253
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,850
Who's there?!

254
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,060
What are you doing here?

255
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,470
Th-This shack is...

256
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,610
o-our secret... base...

257
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,120
Huh? Oh, hey.

258
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,660
You're the brat that was
reading the Hero Guide.

259
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,120
You're that old dude!

260
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,060
Stop calling me that.

261
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,370
What do you want?

262
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,710
U-Um...

263
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:08,530
C-Could you please leave... this shack?

264
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:09,090
Huh?

265
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,950
Why do I have to listen to you?

266
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:17,850
W-Well, the other guys told
me to say that to you...

267
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,840
Your friends? Just say you don't want to.

268
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,160
But...

269
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,170
Stop crying. Jeez, you're annoying.

270
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,850
Don't worry. I won't be here too long.

271
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,360
If you've still got a problem,

272
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,140
bring your friends here.

273
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,960
Got it, you dumb brat?

274
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,460
O-Okay...

275
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,660
Why don't I give you some good advice

276
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,550
to stop people from making fun of you?

277
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,770
Huh?

278
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,630
Yeah. I wanna know.

279
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,840
Tareo sure is taking his time.

280
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,920
I wonder if something happened.

281
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,670
Step back, boys.

282
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,780
It's Death Gatling!

283
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,350
It's dangerous here.

284
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,690
Smileman! And even Stinger!

285
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:08,820
Wow! It's a huge group of heroes!

286
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:12,790
So the hero hunter we keep
hearing about is in that shack?

287
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,490
Yeah.

288
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,270
The hero hunter Garo...

289
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:19,160
Today's the day that we hunt you.

290
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,460
Um... Is there something in there?

291
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,440
There's an extremely dangerous
monster in there.

292
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,880
Hurry and get away from here.

293
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,460
O-Okay...

294
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,800
Crap!

295
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,460
What are we gonna do?
We sent Tareo in there alone.

296
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,450
He should be fine now that
the heroes are here.

297
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,680
Yeah.

298
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:42,270
If you don't want to get bossed around
or mocked by the people around you...

299
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,150
you just need to become stronger!

300
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,060
Huh?

301
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,820
How'd you like that?
Great advice, am I right?

302
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,150
Uh... you just stated the obvious.

303
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,630
Yes! It should be obvious!

304
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,870
See? You do get it!

305
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,370
Laughing makes my wounds hurt...

306
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,450
Are you okay, old dude?

307
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:09,720
Don't worry about me.
More importantly, you should head home.

308
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,340
O-Okay...

309
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,910
The door's opening.

310
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,680
Listen up.

311
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,680
The second we see any part of him,
we all fire at once.

312
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:20,720
We're surrounded.

313
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,630
Wait.

314
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:26,650
Since I gave you such good advice,
you should show me the Hero Guide in return.

315
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,690
You have it, don't you?

316
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:31,530
I do... but why?

317
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,380
Because I need it.

318
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,150
Okay, I guess.

319
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,220
Here you go.

320
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,860
Hero
Guide

321
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:42,080
So this thing has info on
all the heroes, right?

322
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,330
Well, not all of them, but yeah...

323
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,710
I see.

324
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,010
Class A Rank 10
Stinger

325
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,010
Class A Rank 8
Death Gatling

326
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,050
Right out front...

327
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,110
Class B Rank 6
Wildhorn

328
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,110
Class A Rank 27
Smileman

329
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,340
there are four.

330
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,410
Two out back...

331
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,410
Class A Rank 36\h\h\h\h\h\h\h
\h\h\h\h\hChain Toad

332
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,410
Class B Rank 21\h\h\h\h\h
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hMegane

333
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,510
Class B Rank 43 Blam-Blam

334
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,510
Class B Rank 99 Shooter

335
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,510
And one to each side...

336
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,970
So a total of eight.

337
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,020
Under normal circumstances,
they'd be easy to take care of.

338
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,100
But I'm covered in wounds...

339
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,880
Thankfully, there's actually some
useful information in this guide.

340
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,130
There's someone outside, old dude.

341
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,240
Don't talk to me right now.

342
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,530
Tch. There's no time.

343
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,790
Get out here, hero hunter.

344
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:28,370
I'm sure you know we're here!

345
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,710
Hey, dumb brat, take cover on the floor.

346
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,260
All right, I will.

347
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,570
So don't shoot!

348
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,850
Please, don't shoot the shack.

349
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,060
Cooperating just like that?
Are you giving up?

350
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,370
Give me a break.

351
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:51,150
I just don't want to lose the comfy bed
I come back to after I hunt you all down.

352
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,110
You're going to hunt us?

353
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,850
Don't let him rile you up, Wildhorn.

354
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58,110
You seemed to be weakened.

355
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,410
We're taking you back
to the Association alive.

356
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,290
We're going to make you spill your
motives and reveal any co-conspirators.

357
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,470
Spoken like a true hero.

358
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:10,120
How kind of you not to kill me.

359
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:13,050
Wow... Heroes!

360
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,920
They're all really awesome ones, too!

361
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,780
Don't assume you're in the clear yet.
We're not letting you off the hook.

362
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,090
We'll make you regret
calling yourself a monster.

363
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,600
Same goes for you guys.

364
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,970
You'll pay big for calling yourself heroes.

365
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:40,610
Once I eliminate you guys,
I've officially hunted over a hundred heroes!

366
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,610
You're finished!

367
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,870
You're first!

368
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,300
He dodged that midair? Holy crap!

369
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,780
That was close...

370
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:56,330
That thrust definitely wasn't
meant to take me in alive.

371
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,030
Raining arrows?

372
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,270
He figured out my attack even
though I'm not that famous...

373
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:06,140
Those are poisonous arrows...
Glad I read the guide.

374
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:10,850
Why are the heroes attacking him?

375
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,650
He's resisting to the end, despite these odds.

376
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,210
Is that hero hunter just a fool?

377
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,550
Chain Toad,

378
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,650
Tank-Top Master and Metal Bat were
both severely injured by him.

379
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,780
Please don't forget how we
talked about taking him down.

380
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:28,370
To never let our guard down. I know that.

381
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,160
I'm not going to show any mercy!

382
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,450
There's no doubt about it.

383
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,580
He's definitely Silverfang's student.

384
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,970
Guess he's not just some idiot.

385
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,100
He's got some crazy instincts.

386
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:57,830
At mid-range, Chain Toad and
Smileman attack endlessly...

387
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,230
Yes! I got him!

388
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:08,280
But if I move too far away,
Shooter and Blam-Blam shoot me.

389
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,700
I guess Death Gatling is the end boss.

390
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:14,780
Also... what the hell has
that guy been doing?

391
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,420
Shooter!

392
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,540
Thanks!

393
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,250
So he's the support?

394
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,060
They've got me marked from all angles.

395
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,960
In that case...

396
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:27,090
I'll make you my shield!

397
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:27,760
You won't get away!

398
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,410
Shit!

399
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,640
If I let my guard down any more,
he'll shoot me from behind aga—

400
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:35,850
This little shit...

401
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:40,730
It's also my job to take you
down if you try to run.

402
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,240
I won't lose to anyone when it
comes to stamina or persistence.

403
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,320
I wonder how long you'll last
with those poison arrows in you.

404
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,080
And CQC is their job.

405
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,190
I definitely don't have enough strength
to run through all of them right now.

406
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:01,090
Also, like I could actually dodge
bullets, arrows, a chain sickle,

407
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,990
and a kendama in my condition!

408
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,970
This is your last chance to surrender, Garo!

409
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:50,250
Everyone's Dignity
