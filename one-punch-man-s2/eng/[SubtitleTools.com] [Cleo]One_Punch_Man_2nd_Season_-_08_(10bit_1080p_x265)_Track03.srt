1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,430
Closing Ceremony

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:04,400
Congratulations on your win, Suiryu!

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,880
We had a minor incident toward the end,

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,900
but in the end, you won,
completely unscathed!

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,630
Unscathed?

6
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,400
If he hadn't pulled his punch, I would've...

7
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,410
Announcement

8
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,890
We now have an announcement
for everyone here.

9
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,200
There appear to be monsters
outside right now,

10
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,880
so we ask that you do not leave the
venue until the police give the all-clear.

11
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:21,910
Monsters?

12
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:23,020
Again?

13
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,400
We'll be safe from the monsters in here.

14
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:25,880
True.

15
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,970
There's no point in dwelling on it.

16
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,420
I just need to make sure
I never see that guy again.

17
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,300
Hey, you're cute.

18
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,290
Huh?

19
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,680
I'm just going to take it easy.

20
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,970
What's that?!

21
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,250
What is that?!

22
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,750
M-Monsters?!

23
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,110
Look! They're holding
Rosie, Dave, and Bazuzu!

24
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,770
The contestants that were
sent to the hospital..

25
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:54,950
I-I'm outta here!

26
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,240
You guys can deal with the monsters!

27
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,110
See ya!

28
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,300
Hey!

29
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,750
Are all the contestants here?

30
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:18,480
Look at all you runts. How far
the martial arts world has fallen...

31
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,760
Well, whatever.

32
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,970
You're all going to become monsters.

33
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:01,110
The Strong Ones Fight Back

34
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:03,200
Even you trash fighters should be somewhat
useful after you become monsters.

35
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,240
Become monsters?

36
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,000
We pro heroes will put you in your place!

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,710
Way to go, heroes! Kick his ass!

38
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,000
Finished already?

39
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,010
With one hit?

40
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,670
I'm not here to kill you all today.

41
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,850
I'm Goketsu, and I'm here on behalf
of the Monster Association.

42
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,680
Goketsu?!

43
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,390
You don't mean the previous
Super Fight champion?!

44
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,560
If you know who I am,
this shouldn't take too long.

45
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,650
You must realize resistance is futile.

46
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,970
But I heard that he was killed
by a monster a few years ago!

47
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:39,990
So why...

48
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,960
It's true that I was defeated by
a certain monster in the past,

49
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,540
and I was taken to their lair.

50
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,930
But to my surprise, they made me an offer.

51
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:57,100
In return for my cooperation,
they would grant all of my desires!

52
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:04,020
As a monster, I can surpass
the limits I had as a human!

53
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,930
Do you understand what I'm saying? Right now,

54
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,890
I'm on a completely different level
than the martial artist Goketsu!

55
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,060
Rejoice! I have something to give you.

56
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,480
Eat those monster cells.

57
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:22,110
Then you can all become monsters.

58
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,200
If you don't eat them, I'll just kill you.

59
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,950
The Monster Association...

60
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:34,420
What do you want? Are you just
out for murder and destruction?

61
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:39,380
True, violence is a basic
desire for monsters.

62
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,550
But that is not our only motive.

63
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,870
We're trying to go one step higher.

64
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,460
You can just stay there and watch for now,

65
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,830
and observe how physically and
mentally weak humans are.

66
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,310
Choose.

67
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,140
Die or become monsters.

68
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,690
No, don't!

69
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,000
This is amazing!

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,390
I can feel the power and
violence flow through me!

71
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,420
Hey, fatso!

72
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,250
You're gonna regret what you
did to me during our match!

73
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,940
He's got superhuman strength now.

74
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:37,140
How interesting that even a peasant
like him could gain such power.

75
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,400
I should be able to awaken
to the ultimate power,

76
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,800
given I'm the man with the
world's most perfect genes.

77
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,490
Choze, not you, too!

78
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,980
Not only did it improve
my physical functioning,

79
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,790
but I can feel my subconscious
limits falling away.

80
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,000
So this is how it feels to be
a monster? Let's see...

81
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,990
Jakumen!

82
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,840
Now I'll definitely be able to kill that guy!

83
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:14,310
I'll make him pay for embarrassing
me like that... with his death!

84
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,730
You didn't turn out too bad.

85
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,400
We do have winners and losers,
depending on what we're working with.

86
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,270
Go on. The rest of you filth
need to eat those, too.

87
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,170
Please, spare me!

88
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,780
Benpats!

89
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,570
This is for survival.

90
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:31,910
Hamukichi!

91
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,670
This is to become stronger!

92
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,370
Not you, too, Boltane!

93
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,920
I feel like I can do anything now!

94
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,820
This feels great!

95
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,420
They all turned into monsters!

96
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,890
Wh-Wh-What should we do?

97
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,010
Hey.

98
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,350
If I can chase those guys off,
will you go on a date with me?

99
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,810
Great! That settles it.

100
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,770
I'm going to relieve all that stress
from the finals right now.

101
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,590
Oh? We actually have someone who
dares defy us in this situation?

102
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,860
So be it.

103
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,870
We're to eliminate anyone who dares to
become an enemy of the Monster Association.

104
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,460
Finish him!

105
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,080
You fool! You're nothing but a playboy!

106
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,870
You suddenly want to play hero now?

107
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,330
That's not it.

108
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,500
It's just that you guys

109
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,300
are in the way...

110
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,150
of my fun lifestyle.

111
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,540
Well, well... You're not half bad.

112
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,080
Not half bad?

113
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,910
Your answer suggests you lack intelligence.

114
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,810
What's that?

115
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:11,840
I've decided.

116
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:17,000
I'll remake this world with only
those of my own choosing.

117
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,850
And all of you fail.

118
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,060
Begone.

119
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,140
This is nothing!

120
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,070
What?!

121
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,870
And in my eyes, you just failed.

122
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,420
Entertain me a little more.

123
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,380
You fool!

124
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,170
They're too fast! I can't see anything!

125
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,470
Dark Body Quake Tiger Fist!

126
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,850
Dark Body Phoenix Rising Fist!

127
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,360
Way to go!

128
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,830
Ouch... I haven't bled in a long time.

129
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,620
This "monsterization" stuff sure is wild.

130
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,660
They all became way stronger.

131
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,840
You know, it would be a
waste to just kill you.

132
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,040
I'll still let you change your mind.

133
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,770
The world will eventually
belong to the monsters.

134
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,580
That means the strong can
go as crazy as they want,

135
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,330
kill all they want, and enjoy true freedom.

136
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,720
It'll be a world of blood and violence.

137
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,970
You can live an enjoyable life as a monster.

138
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,640
Not a bad deal, is it?

139
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,560
Don't tell me...

140
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,770
I see.

141
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,440
You're saying it doesn't matter
what the world's like,

142
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,970
as long as you enjoy yourself...

143
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:06,040
Well, sorry... but the last thing
I ever want to be is as ugly as you!

144
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,770
Dark Body Flying Dragon Fist!

145
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,790
Yes!

146
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,370
Then you get to die.

147
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,470
Watchdog Man!

148
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,160
You're awesome!

149
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,240
Thank you!

150
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,680
You really are the guardian deity of City Q!

151
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,860
I guess he really is a Class S hero.

152
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,810
Just before I started my hunt,
monsters suddenly attacked.

153
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,380
I was amazed at how powerful
and fast he was in that battle,

154
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,780
but it's nothing.

155
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,160
I can deal with him just fine.

156
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,950
Watchdog Man, it's your turn to be hunted!

157
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:54,290
Are you human, or are you a monster?

158
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,840
Fist of Flowing Water Crushed Rock!

159
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,930
I didn't say, "Shake!"

160
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:07,180
He does have speed and
power, if nothing else.

161
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,520
But he's inhuman!

162
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,940
What? You done already?

163
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,650
Stand up. I'll give you three seconds.

164
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:21,510
Three, two, one...

165
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,790
Good, good... Keep fighting back,
as if your life depends on it!

166
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,380
Damn it... He's not even flinching.

167
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,340
What do I do?

168
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,340
You can take care of those guys, too.

169
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,620
Well, this isn't good...

170
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,060
Come on, now, pay attention!

171
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:00,320
It broke...

172
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,300
Well? What's the matter?

173
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,290
Stand up. I'll give you three seconds.

174
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,660
Three, two, one...

175
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,590
Dark Body Quake Tiger Fist!

176
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,220
H-He caught my strongest attack?!

177
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,140
He's strong...

178
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,310
He surpasses me in every way...

179
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,900
S-So this is... a monster?

180
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:50,830
Hey, guys. You get some good grub today.

181
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,340
Enjoy your meal!

182
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,960
They were my disciples.

183
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,420
But they were mentally weak,

184
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,840
so when they turned into monsters,
they lost their sense of self.

185
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,590
Damn it!

186
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,930
This isn't good!

187
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,650
Hey, you! I'm in trouble here!
Lend me a hand!

188
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,650
Suiryu.

189
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:24,900
After observing the finals,
I've realized that you're stronger than me.

190
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:29,510
There's no way that I can
beat you. I'll admit that.

191
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:33,080
But now, you're on the verge of death.

192
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,670
How ironic.

193
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,330
You may have taken the top
position in human society,

194
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,140
but you don't stand a chance
against these monsters.

195
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,980
That's why I'm asking for your help!

196
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,920
I've made up my mind.

197
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,300
I'm going to become a monster, as well.

198
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,300
You can just die right here.

199
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,500
I give up on becoming the
world's strongest person.

200
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,820
I'll aim to be the ultimate
being on the next level!

201
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,590
Jeez, he actually ate all of them.

202
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,730
You greedy bastard.

203
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:08,100
Shut up! I'll shut that trap
of yours myself in a moment.

204
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,080
Looks like your body's not holding up.

205
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,810
You've failed to become a monster.

206
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:21,210
Now, then... You're
finally the only one left.

207
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,420
Hero Association Hospital

208
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:29,850
There are patients up ahead in
the ICU that can't be moved!

209
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,300
As a hero, I can't back down!

210
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,990
In the end, heroes are only human.

211
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:38,770
You're only worth being
oppressed by us monsters.

212
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,000
Everyone ran off,

213
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,870
or they were defeated.

214
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:51,660
Good for you. Now you can cry and
scream without anyone seeing you.

215
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,120
Go on. Let me hear you scream.

216
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,490
Coiling Defense!

217
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,170
Lightning Kick!

218
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,530
Snek! Max!

219
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,460
You're okay!

220
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,720
But why... Why did you come back?

221
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,930
To help.

222
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,100
Now that we're dressed like
this, we're the real deal.

223
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:22,060
This suit is strong against
monster claws, fangs, and beaks.

224
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,670
It's a battle suit!

225
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,990
I'm also wearing my lightning shoes!

226
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,570
Now we can really show
you what we're made of!

227
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,820
We're up against three opponents, though.

228
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,140
Can we leave one of them to you?

229
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:34,990
Yeah!

230
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,090
You guys are lifesavers. Thank you!

231
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:48,940
Tank-Top Tackle!

232
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,140
That was an amazing tackle...

233
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,060
Don't try so hard when you're
not wearing a tank-top.

234
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,610
Can you stand, Mumen Rider?

235
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:02,350
Yeah.

236
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,980
I sure can.

237
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,450
All right... My legs can still move.

238
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,820
Now, let's get out of here.

239
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,100
Why are you taking fighting
stances, you two?

240
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,410
We'll hold him back.

241
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,780
Use that chance to run.

242
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:21,000
You can't be serious!
You guys don't stand a chance!

243
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,190
I mean, you two were lower than me...

244
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,170
You're kidding... Aren't you scared?

245
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,680
This is my last chance!

246
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,270
I need to run! Run! Run! Run!

247
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,090
Where do you think you're going?!

248
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:47,810
Things are just getting interesting!

249
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,920
Oh? I guess this one was a winner after all.

250
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,740
It looks like you're the same
threat level as me: Dragon.

251
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,230
Of course I am!

252
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,880
Oh? You're still trying to stand?

253
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,820
Our first objective...

254
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:24,680
Let the monsters run wild to show
the humans how terrifying we are.

255
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,330
That part is going very well.

256
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,500
No place is safe anymore.

257
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:33,340
Everything is enveloped
in uneasiness and fear.

258
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,300
Objective number two...

259
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:39,620
Kidnapping someone connected
to the Hero Association.

260
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,510
That was also a success.

261
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,660
We managed to kidnap the son
of one of their executives.

262
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,070
And objective number three...

263
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,630
Turning worthy humans into monsters.

264
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,130
This is also going well.

265
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,980
Nyaan infiltrated a prison

266
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:59,050
and monsterized a bunch of violent
inmates, and is heading back here.

267
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:02,640
It appears Goketsu has turned some of
the martial artists into monsters, as well.

268
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,150
That should also bring us
some worthy monsters.

269
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,550
It appears Goketsu is still...

270
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:13,250
Hey, Goketsu. Come back.

271
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,310
If multiple Class S heroes show up,
even you will end up with broken bones.

272
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:18,990
Don't underestimate me.

273
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,700
But I'm done here, anyway.

274
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,540
Hey, newbie.

275
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,730
Huh?

276
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,000
I'll take you to our hideout. Come with me.

277
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:32,590
Don't you dare order me around!

278
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,340
Just listen.

279
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:47,460
There are a number of monsters,
including me, who are stronger than you.

280
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,310
Don't let your head get too big.

281
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,460
Are the other monsters heading
back to the hideout, as well?

282
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,110
That means the heroes,
including Class S heroes,

283
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,950
will head toward any remaining monsters.

284
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,320
A simpleton like you
wouldn't stand a chance.

285
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:05,290
I've given you a warning.
Now, I'm heading back.

286
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,290
The outskirts of City Z.

287
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,250
That's where you can find us.

288
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,260
Did you hear that, Suiryu?

289
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,710
There's a ton of monsters.

290
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,510
Hilarious, isn't it?

291
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,470
That guy's punch freaked me out.

292
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,740
Yeah, I'm done trying to be the strongest.

293
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,060
S-Say, Bakuzan...

294
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,310
I have no intention of fighting anymore.

295
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,490
Please... Just let me go.

296
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:39,370
You see, Suiryu...

297
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,950
S-Stop...

298
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:47,830
I've always been a guy who loved
hurting those weaker than me!

299
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:51,410
That's the only reason I
wanted to become stronger!

300
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,920
Now that I'm free, I feel great!

301
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,880
Let's go for another!

302
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:04,340
Wow, the great Suiryu
actually screamed in agony.

303
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,760
It's too bad we don't have
an audience to witness this.

304
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:15,610
Youth, talent, popularity,
money, women, and freedom.

305
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:19,460
Don't you think you're a bit
greedy to have all of that?

306
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:25,910
I'll let you taste a bit of hell
before you die to make up for it!

307
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,290
You're pathetic, Champion.

308
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,180
Someone!

309
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,790
Help me!

310
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,510
A monster!

311
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:42,610
There's a monster here!

312
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,650
Isn't there anyone who can help me?!

313
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,480
I'm being attacked by a monster!

314
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,990
Please!

315
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:52,190
Heroes... Right! Heroes!

316
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:55,690
If you can hear me, please come here!

317
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:59,610
Heroes! Please come!

318
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,230
There's a monster here...

319
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,750
Heroes...

320
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,890
No one's going to hear you.

321
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,450
No heroes are going to come.

322
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,910
You're going to die!

323
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,370
No one stands a chance against this guy...

324
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:17,080
No matter how strong some heroes may be...

325
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:22,090
But, please... Rise up once again...

326
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:29,020
When people find themselves in
darkness, they seek the light.

327
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:35,060
It doesn't matter how faint
or small that light is.

328
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:39,560
As long as it's there, there's hope...

329
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,820
This is what you call despair.

330
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,080
Who the hell are you?

331
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:59,290
I'm a hero.

332
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,260
I heard you call for help, Suiryu.

333
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,220
You did well on your own.

334
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,720
Leave the rest to me.

335
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:50,250
The Ultimate Dilemma
