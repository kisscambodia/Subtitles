1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:03,520
What's the matter?

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,310
You can't stand?

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,550
Fist of Flowing Water, Crushed Rock

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,670
Charanko, what have you been
doing here the last six months?

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,910
Didn't I tell you that if you were
going to become my student,

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,370
you needed to train like
your life depended on it?

7
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,470
You won't be able to learn any techniques.

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,620
You're not fit to be a martial artist.

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,870
I am expelling you from
this dojo as of today.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,790
Don't ever come back again.

11
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,930
Bang is acting strange?

12
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:07,310
The Hunt Begins

13
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,810
He suddenly said we were going to do a
lesson, then beat the crap out of me.

14
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,520
I can't believe someone as kind
as Master Bang would do this.

15
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,640
There has to be a reason.

16
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:15,030
I came here because I thought
you guys might know something.

17
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,490
I have no idea.

18
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,660
Bang? You mean the Class S Silverfang?

19
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,530
Once you're done talking,
let's continue our game.

20
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,160
There seem to be more of you here now...

21
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,240
I can at least guess what's going on.

22
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,170
I'm assuming that Garo is somehow involved.

23
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,910
Garo?!

24
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:37,050
You mean the guy who was expelled
from our dojo? Why him?

25
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,380
What? You haven't heard?

26
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,780
Bang's former disciple, Garo,

27
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,430
has been classified as an evil monster
and is wanted by the Hero Association.

28
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,560
Bang said he'd bring him down himself.

29
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,850
Monster? Garo?

30
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,160
Apparently, there was an incident
at the Hero Association HQ.

31
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,280
The Association's trying to hide it,

32
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,900
but if there's an intense battle,
bystanders are sure to get hurt.

33
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,200
That's probably why Bang wanted
to distance you from it all.

34
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,830
I see...

35
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,160
Master Bang, am I just holding you back?

36
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,130
What do you think about Bang's
actions, Master Saitama?

37
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,680
It's not like I'm that
close with that old man.

38
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:23,780
Silverfang, huh?
That's such a good hero name.

39
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,510
Silverfang

40
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,060
Bald Cape

41
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,620
What the hell is "Bald Cape"
even supposed to mean?

42
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,600
There's one thing that's bothering me.

43
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,800
Who are you?

44
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,250
Master, he's some small fry named Charanko.
He's Bang's current number one student.

45
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,610
We've met him before.

46
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,750
Huh? Have we?

47
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,810
I can't keep holding him back forever.

48
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,830
I need to take care of Garo for Master Bang.

49
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,460
But I guess there's no way
I'll find him that easily.

50
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,920
Even if I happen to find Garo, I—

51
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,880
Hey, you.

52
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,050
You're a hero, aren't you?

53
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,550
I am indeed. My name is Mumen Rider.

54
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,550
Class C Rank 1
Mumen Rider

55
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,930
I'm going to hunt you.

56
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:12,690
What do you mean by "hunt"?
You don't seem like a fan of mine.

57
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:17,440
Help me become a true monster.

58
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,230
Found you!

59
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,960
You sure that's him?

60
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,150
It sure is.

61
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,860
Hey! I came to repay you for the other da—

62
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,160
You came to get revenge,
Tank-Top Vegetarian?

63
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,820
Well, aren't you an adorable fool,
coming here to throw away the life you

64
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,290
were given a second chance at?

65
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,750
I'll kill the rest of your
musclehead buddies, too.

66
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,710
Die!

67
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:48,350
What?

68
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,310
I heard you gave my bro a hard time.

69
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,310
Class S Rank 16
Tank-Top Master

70
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,750
A Class S?!

71
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,170
I've caught a big one!

72
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,770
This is great! I'm getting all fired up!

73
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,660
Tank-Top Tackle!

74
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,540
There it is! Master's Tank-Top Tackle!

75
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,670
He's taken down countless
monsters with that move!

76
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,880
Way to go, Master! Now that bastard—

77
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,370
Bro, he didn't go down!

78
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,180
All right, Little Bro. Prepare to run!

79
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,730
Is he really...

80
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,150
human?

81
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:44,400
Fist of Flowing Water, Crushed Rock

82
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,420
Is everything ready?

83
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,490
I'm an old man with no family.

84
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,640
Just like you.

85
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:54,790
Master of the Fist
of Whirling Wind,
Slashing Steel

86
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,320
You can't be serious.

87
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,790
I've said goodbye to several hundred pupils.

88
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:59,440
You dropped everything to help out
your precious little brother.

89
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,540
You're so cool, Big Brother.

90
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:08,090
If we left Garo alone, he'd eventually
come for my dojo, as well.

91
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,590
All right, let's go!

92
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,850
Be careful, Big Brother.

93
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,950
I can't even imagine how powerful he is now,

94
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,400
Considering you took the time to summon me...

95
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,810
There's another one! Tank-Top Punch!

96
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,630
I freaked out for a second when he
stood up after Master's tackle, but...

97
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,700
This will probably be over soon.

98
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,600
He's human. There's no doubt about that.

99
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,580
Still, I wonder why...

100
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,500
I feel like I need to make
him disappear here and now.

101
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,960
Sorry, but this is the end.

102
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,630
Hold it right there!

103
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,590
Mumen Rider!

104
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,550
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?!

105
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:58,140
You're a Class S hero, and you're
trying to finish off a human?!

106
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,140
This fight is over!

107
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,840
It's his fault for picking
a fight with a hero!

108
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,790
Get out of the way!

109
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,570
We're gonna show this guy
how terrifying we are!

110
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:06,980
All of you, stop.

111
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,320
He's right.

112
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,620
I didn't start wearing a tank-top
just so I could fight with humans.

113
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,720
Hey, you.

114
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,330
If you've learned your lesson, swear that
you'll never hurt anyone ever again.

115
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,290
Fine...

116
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm going home. Sorry for losing control.

117
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,870
As if.

118
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,550
I'm still going to murder all of you!

119
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,050
Yeah. I figured as much.

120
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,180
I'll take care of you, here and now.

121
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,850
Whoops. Guess I used it.

122
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:46,940
I wanted to avoid it since it reminds
me of the old man, but whatever.

123
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,940
Fist of Flowing Water,
Crushed
Rock

124
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,030
He...

125
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,180
He was hiding his true abilities!

126
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,890
Oh, what's this?

127
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,870
A mighty Class S hero is on his knees?

128
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,980
Don't underestimate me. You just
took me by surprise, that's all.

129
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,070
You can just sit there and watch

130
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,760
as the Monster Garo finishes off
every last member of your crew.

131
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:20,820
Garo?! You're Garo, the human
calling himself a monster?!

132
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,850
W-Wait! Don't touch them!

133
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,640
Justice Crash!

134
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,870
Well? Come at me.

135
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,960
Garo!

136
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,590
I know your fighting style now.

137
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,380
I'm done with you, Tank-Top Master.

138
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,830
Now, then... I guess I'd better
clean up the rest of you.

139
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,970
You bastard! You really think
you can beat our numbers?!

140
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:07,850
Why, you—

141
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,670
You're finished, Garo!

142
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,600
You've brought shame upon our dojo!

143
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,090
Take this! Fist of Flowing
Water, Crushed Rock!

144
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,030
This is awful.

145
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,240
Looks like we were a little too late.

146
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:50,210
Bang, can you predict where
he might show up next?

147
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,340
Bang?

148
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,680
Charanko...

149
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,820
I heard that Tank-Top Master got
taken out by the hero hunter.

150
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,900
You can't be serious.

151
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,620
Even a Class S couldn't defeat him?

152
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:11,060
Apparently, his followers and Mumen Rider,
who were also there, got beat up, too.

153
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,090
So the guy's going after any hero?

154
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:16,120
It doesn't even matter if they're
Class A or C? Give me a break...

155
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,920
Quit freaking out, guys.

156
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,180
Let's just catch this hero hunter ourselves!

157
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,300
How?

158
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,360
The guy took out a Class S!

159
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,930
You idiots. He's not some scary monster.

160
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,850
He's just a human.

161
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,520
But I heard that he's a former
student of Silverfang's.

162
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,140
I know some martial arts, too.

163
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,650
If a guy punches like this, you do this.

164
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,280
If he punches like this, you go like, "bam!"

165
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,620
And if he goes like this, you do... this!

166
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,580
There he is.

167
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,330
Hero Association Hospital

168
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:51,180
I'm glad you came to visit me, Saitama.

169
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,850
Sure. Can I put the bananas here?

170
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,640
Yeah, thanks.

171
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,870
Of course you're eating them...

172
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,640
It was all over the
Hero Association newspaper.

173
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:09,440
A single monster took out dozens of heroes.

174
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,200
Glad to see you made it out alive.

175
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,910
Here, have a banana.

176
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,570
He was a human.

177
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,290
Huh?

178
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,090
A human calling himself a monster.

179
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:21,450
But he's strong.
He's a terrifyingly strong human.

180
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,460
Who was stronger, the fish monster or him?

181
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:30,030
Hmm... The Deep Sea King was pretty insane,
but there's something different this time.

182
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,040
His techniques.

183
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,250
He's an expert martial artist.

184
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,130
It appears that Silverfang
raised one nasty monster.

185
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,710
This dude just jumped into our conversation.
Do you have any idea who he is?

186
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:48,030
You know. He's the Class
S hero, Tank-Top Master.

187
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,590
Oh, yeah. You were in the paper, too.

188
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,830
It said you got your ass beat the worst.

189
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,780
Can't you just say I stood my ground the most?!

190
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:58,490
Damn! To think I'd let such a kid
get the better of me...

191
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:01,440
Martial arts can be such a pain in the ass.

192
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,810
Martial arts?

193
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:03,940
Here, have a banana.

194
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,370
Oh... Thanks.

195
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:10,310
Now, could you tell me more about this guy?

196
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,960
Zombieman

197
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,960
King

198
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,020
Hey, kid.

199
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,170
Looks like you're reading
something interesting.

200
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,970
This guy's the Class S hero, King.

201
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,930
He's the strongest one of all.

202
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,170
This is the Class A hero, Lightning Genji.

203
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,990
He's always patrolling my neighborhood.

204
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:41,190
Lightning
Genji

205
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,430
Look! I even got his autograph!

206
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:40,940
His autograph, eh?

207
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,180
I'd love his autograph, too.

208
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,790
Could you introduce me sometime?

209
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,370
Sure! You must like heroes, too, old dude.

210
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:54,830
Hero
Guide

211
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:55,090
That Hero Guide looks neat.
Say, could I borrow that, just for a week?

212
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,790
What? No way. Get your own.

213
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,960
Jeez, you're so stingy.

214
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,890
Hey, what the heck?
They even have monsters in here!

215
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,250
Isn't that exciting?

216
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:13,670
What? Why are you excited about the
monster pages? They're super scary.

217
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,130
It's better that they're scary.
Don't you think they're cooler that way?

218
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,130
Really? You have weird taste, old dude.

219
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm so envious.
I'd love to be in this book, too.

220
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,970
You want to be a hero?

221
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:30,610
I do, too... but I have no athletic talent.

222
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,490
Well, good for you.

223
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,910
Your personality sucks, old dude.

224
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,260
Well, then... Time to go patrolling.

225
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,670
I'm heading off.

226
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,580
According to the guide,

227
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,710
this is around the time when the Class A
hero, Golden Ball, visits his favorite bar.

228
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,340
See ya, kid.

229
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,540
Be careful on your patrol, old dude.

230
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:55,850
Sure. Also, stop calling me "old dude."
Learn how to talk to people.

231
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,050
Huh? What was that, old dude?

232
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,350
Hurry up and go home, kid.

233
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:06,430
All my attacks were dodged,
parried, and blocked.

234
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,570
He also used throws and counters
against me by reading my moves.

235
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,030
He can deal twice the damage by using
his opponents' strength against them.

236
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,670
The strikes to our joints and
vital points were also brutal.

237
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,750
He also incapacitated physical functions.

238
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:27,050
Your average monster usually just lets
all its strength loose in a rampage.

239
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:31,770
But he's different. He has
special techniques to break people.

240
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,600
Fist of Flowing Water,
Crushed
Rock

241
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:35,490
In other words, he knows
how to take down heroes.

242
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:45,940
Charanko

243
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,330
You want to spar with
a strong martial artist?

244
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,280
Yeah.

245
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,710
I'm sorta interested now.
Got any connections,

246
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:47,180
uh... Champon?

247
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,820
It's Charanko!

248
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,980
Here. I'll even give you a banana.

249
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,450
Don't put that there!

250
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:59,080
Then just go see Master Bang.
He seems to like you, anyway.

251
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,170
Come on, now.
I can't push around an old guy.

252
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,670
Hey, that's rude!

253
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,380
A normal person can't fight a
martial artist right off the bat, anyway.

254
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,280
First, you have to learn the basic forms...

255
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,840
Actually, before that,
you have to build up stamina.

256
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,440
You can run up and down
hundreds of steps...

257
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,330
Or start by wiping the dojo floors...

258
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,720
Guess I'll leave if you
don't have any connections.

259
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,510
H-Hold on a sec!

260
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:25,470
There was a mixed martial arts competition
I happened to enter on a whim.

261
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,090
The ticket is... Here you go.

262
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,780
Charanko
Participant Ticket

263
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,780
It's all wrinkled.

264
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:34,950
I registered as a participant,
but I plan to bail.

265
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:39,200
It still works as an entry ticket, though,
so you can go watch the competition.

266
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,340
You'll be able to see all kinds of styles.

267
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,050
Thanks.

268
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,090
Stare...

269
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,750
So you're going to drop out?

270
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,090
Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty hurt.

271
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:51,630
Stare...

272
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,810
It says the prize money is three million yen.

273
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,700
Well, it's a huge tournament.

274
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,000
The champion gets three
million in one day's pay.

275
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:59,640
Stare...

276
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,100
Just so you know, you
can't enter in my place.

277
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,640
Hey. Are you listening to me?

278
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,850
Izakaya
Kodoku

279
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,850
You must be the Class A hero, Golden Ball.

280
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:03,930
Huh?

281
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,440
Class A Rank 26
Golden Ball

282
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,430
I have some business with you.
Step outside for a bit.

283
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,890
At least let me enjoy a drink first.

284
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:13,140
Hey, what the hell?! Jeez, what a waste.

285
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:19,070
Sure, wild guy. There's a parking lot nearby.

286
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,330
Let's go there.

287
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:26,210
Every once in a while, I get punks
who want to challenge a pro hero.

288
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:31,050
If you're picking a fight just because
you're drunk, you should reconsider.

289
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,360
This is your chance to bail.

290
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,800
Shut up, you drunk. I'm—

291
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,680
You bastard.

292
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,690
You're way too lax, hero hunter.

293
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,270
Did Tank-Top Master seriously
lose to a punk like you?

294
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,690
Just so you know, I'm pretty
good at hunting, myself.

295
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,730
After I take you down,
I'm gonna go have another drink!

296
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,630
He guessed the bullet's trajectory
by reading my hand movements.

297
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:03,030
Then how about this?!

298
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,140
A ricochet?

299
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,630
Whoops.

300
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,850
Luckily for you, I missed your vital
points, but what do you think of that?

301
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,740
Aren't heroes amazing?

302
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,980
Luckily? It's because you're
so drunk that your aim is off.

303
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,910
You're going to lose because you couldn't
finish me off with that one shot.

304
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,580
Unfortunately for you,
I've got plenty of ammo left.

305
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,820
Shape-memory Golden Bullets!

306
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,750
Take this!

307
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,450
Killer Move: Golden Breakout!

308
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:39,480
He's dodging all the bullets
with minimal movement...

309
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,290
This guy's insane!

310
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,290
But... This is my final shot.

311
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,620
I'm going to end this.

312
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,610
How'd you like that?

313
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,310
Aren't monsters amazing?

314
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,890
You're finished.

315
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,420
Die.

316
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,120
You weren't at the bar,

317
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,280
so I thought you had forgotten about our plans.

318
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:16,280
Class A Rank 28
Spring Mustachio

319
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,360
The Class A hero, Spring Mustachio?

320
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,420
I'm flattered that you've heard of me.

321
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,120
You must be the hero hunter
I keep hearing about.

322
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:29,050
Ding, ding. For your prize,
I'll crush you now, too.

323
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:31,480
His right leg's been injured.

324
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,630
That should slow down his footwork.

325
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,510
I see. Thank you for the advice.

326
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,140
Doesn't swinging that thing in a cramped
place like this put you at a disadvantage?

327
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,970
Oh, I'm not so sure about... that!

328
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,500
I have you now!

329
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,490
Tomboy!

330
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,010
I've... got you!

331
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:12,660
Did you guys know that your trump
cards are listed in the Hero Guide?

332
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,010
Opponents with weapons are easy
once you get used to them.

333
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,590
Hey, don't get ahead of yourself.

334
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,890
You can't keep doing this forever.

335
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,660
I'm going to continue getting stronger.

336
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,230
Just try and take me out if you can!

337
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,900
Until you do, I'll keep doing
whatever the hell I want.

338
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,110
Hey, the Hero Association
makes a lot of money, right?

339
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:37,780
Don't say things like that.

340
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,770
It costs a lot of money to keep the peace.

341
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,490
It's not like we're loaded.

342
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,730
Then why did you buy this for me?

343
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,580
And why do you always stop by our place?

344
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,580
To keep the peace, of course.

345
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,570
For an official from the Hero Association,

346
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,330
fooling around with you
two is a necessary expense.

347
00:19:54,330 --> 00:20:00,090
As someone who fights evil on the front lines,
I need a way to restore my energy.

348
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,450
Letting loose, eh?

349
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,590
That means you're letting
loose every single day.

350
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:07,270
Oh, I know. Why don't I introduce
you to Amai Mask next time?

351
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,450
What? Really?

352
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,930
I'm a huge fan of his!

353
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,960
If you give me a kiss on the cheek.

354
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,270
What? I'm not sure about that...

355
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,050
For real? Really?

356
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,010
Let me meet him, too.

357
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,940
I'll gladly kiss you on the cheek.

358
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,880
Letting loose, letting loose.

359
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,240
Life's so peaceful.

360
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:26,680
I felt great after defeating
those Class A heroes...

361
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,020
Now I feel like I just stepped in shit.

362
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,680
Fighting evil on the front lines?

363
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,830
You make me sick.

364
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,590
Oh, hey. I finally found you.

365
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,250
I've been looking for you.

366
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,130
Reinforcements? Is he a hero, too?

367
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,350
I've never seen him before.

368
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,010
Must be some nameless bottom-ranker.

369
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:46,010
He's probably trying to catch me
so he can climb up the ranks.

370
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,930
Well, I'll strike first!

371
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:48,760
Huh?

372
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,580
What's the big idea?

373
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,500
Who the hell are you?

374
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,360
You trying to rob me?

375
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,230
Don't interfere with my shopping.

376
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,290
Excuse me, could I get this?

377
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,700
That'll be 3,000 yen.

378
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,300
That's sorta expensive.

379
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,920
Not bad.

380
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,720
Master...

381
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,690
It bothers you that much...

382
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:53,720
Wait, it's not like that.

383
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:57,370
I haven't decided to wear a wig
for the rest of my life or anything.

384
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,270
Doctor Kuseno, it's me, Genos.

385
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,170
There's something I'd like
to discuss immediately.

386
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,400
Master Saitama is in a perilous state.

387
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,800
Those synthetic hair implants
made of reinforced fiber...

388
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,420
You said you could implant them
into living skin, correct?

389
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,250
Yes, that's right.
I believe I'll need them after all.

390
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,270
So black is one of the color options?

391
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:16,590
If we decide to go forward with the
operation, when will you be available?

392
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,770
The sooner the better?

393
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,450
Next Wednesday? I see.

394
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:20,850
Yes, I'll be accompanying him.

395
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:23,050
Understood. Let's go with that day.

396
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,710
Thank you for all of your help.

397
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,210
Master Saitama!
Are you free next Wednesday?

398
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:32,070
Stop trying to stick reinforced fiber
into my head without my permission.

399
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,760
I'm going to enter a martial
arts tournament wearing this.

400
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,430
As Charanko.

401
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:38,390
It's today?

402
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:41,930
Yup. See you later.

403
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,100
I'm gonna go try out this
martial arts thing.

404
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:50,030
Metal Bat
