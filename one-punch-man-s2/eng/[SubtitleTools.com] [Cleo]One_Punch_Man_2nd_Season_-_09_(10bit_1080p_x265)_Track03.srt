1
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:07,520
I heard you call for help, Suiryu.

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,970
You did well on your own.

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,370
Leave the rest to me.

4
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,860
That head...

5
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,350
A hero?

6
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,060
A hero?!

7
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,050
You stupid little hero!

8
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,810
Did you show up just to try
to make a name for yourself?

9
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,190
The Ultimate Dilemma

10
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,490
Don't make me laugh!

11
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,190
You don't even realize how weak you are!

12
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,820
You're just...

13
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,230
You're...

14
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,350
Huh?!

15
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,200
Who are you? Have we met before?

16
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,200
Shut up!

17
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,820
Now that I'm a monster, you can take

18
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,580
the full course of pain
dealt by the great Bakuzan!

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,080
Art of Darkness Hell-Killer!

20
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,580
Demon-Weeper Low Kick!

21
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,180
You guys, too?

22
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,900
It's impressive that you didn't
get knocked over by that blow,

23
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,690
but I know you're regretting your actions,
now that you see how powerful I am!

24
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,310
Bear-Killer Mid Kick!

25
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,830
He's protecting those
guys who are passed out?

26
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,860
Wait... You need to protect yourself!

27
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,910
Carnage Punch!

28
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,870
If you want to apologize for what you did
to me during our match, now's the time!

29
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,790
How boring. Looks like you've lost your mind.

30
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,340
I'll just finish you now!

31
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,050
You and those insects next to you
can all be crushed in bits!

32
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,760
Hell-Bringin' Hand Chop!

33
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,380
Nope. Can't remember who you are.

34
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,020
What the hell was this guy's problem?

35
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,420
Oh, well.

36
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,750
Man, you must've been through hell.

37
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,940
After you won the tournament, too.

38
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,790
Anyway, I defeated the monster,
so keep up the good work.

39
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,610
R-Right...

40
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,740
Thanks for saving me.

41
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,450
H-Hey, who are you really?

42
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,920
I'm Saitama. A hero.

43
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,880
Saitama? So you entered the
tournament under a false name?

44
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,410
Oh, shit.

45
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,990
Why did you enter?

46
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,070
Is this some plan that the
Hero Association came up with?

47
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,760
No... I just wanted to
experience martial arts.

48
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,680
There's the prize money, too.

49
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:14,140
There's this hero hunter
going around lately,

50
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,380
and I heard he was a martial
arts expert, so I got curious.

51
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,420
I see... So it was a
strategy to deal with him.

52
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,030
I wouldn't go so far as
to call it a strategy...

53
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,600
I just happened to get my
hands on an entry ticket.

54
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,230
To be more specific...

55
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,330
I was bored.

56
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,580
You were bored?

57
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,610
But I'm alive, thanks to you.

58
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,350
I should've shown up sooner.

59
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,860
Hey, Saitama.

60
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,030
You shouldn't go outside.

61
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,510
Members of some organization

62
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,260
called the Monster Association
are wreaking havoc.

63
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,380
For real?

64
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:55,900
Yeah. Apparently, they have the ability
to turn humans into monsters.

65
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,520
That's what happened to
the guy you just defeated.

66
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,770
Remember Bakuzan, from the second round?

67
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,000
That was him?

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,410
I don't really remember
every single guy I punch.

69
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:11,360
Anyway, it's really dangerous right
now, so you should just stay put.

70
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,020
I'm sure Goketsu is nearby, too.

71
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,260
Goketsu?

72
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,790
Yeah, there was another
really dangerous monster.

73
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,380
He basically handled me like I was a baby.

74
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,630
There's no way that strength was fair.

75
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,010
I need to go back as soon
as my repairs are finished.

76
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:34,270
I know it was a surprise attack, but that
monster defeated me in a single blow.

77
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,480
I can't let that thing run free.

78
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,580
I need to get the Class S heroes together

79
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,320
and get Master Saitama to help, as well.

80
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,320
We'll take him down together!

81
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,900
He's that strong?

82
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,280
Even if we meticulously plan and prepare,
I'm not sure we can defeat him.

83
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,030
I see.

84
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,910
So, where'd this monster go?

85
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,160
Huh? Well, he's over there...

86
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,540
Oh, so that's what that loud noise was.

87
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,240
I'll be right back.

88
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,290
H-Hey! Wait a second!

89
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,930
You heard what I just told you, right?
I just warned you!

90
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,800
Yeah, I heard you. So what?

91
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,640
You still don't get it?

92
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,140
He's also a former top-class martial artist!

93
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,600
He's not some normal guy!
He's going to kill you!

94
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,290
Ah, so he's a martial arts expert.

95
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,730
That works out great.
I wasn't actually satisfied yet.

96
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,340
H-Hey. You're hurt, aren't you?

97
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,360
Don't push yourself.

98
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,750
I'm not letting go! I can't let the
person who saved my life just die!

99
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,220
I couldn't stop him!

100
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:01,030
After I just...
After I finally met a true hero!

101
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,350
He's not supposed to die here!

102
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:08,610
He was supposed to save
many, many more lives!

103
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,330
Huh?

104
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,960
Oh, yeah. I forgot one thing.

105
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,340
Could you keep the fact that I lied
to enter this competition a secret?

106
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,960
Was Goketsu tough, at least?

107
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,680
I mean, he still only took one punch,
so I couldn't tell the difference.

108
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,810
There's something that I forgot to ask you.

109
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,890
What?

110
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:46,900
I don't know if it'll help me get
over my fear, but I have a goal now.

111
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,990
Do you think I can become a hero, too?

112
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,940
No idea.

113
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,740
Huh?

114
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,320
But, I mean...

115
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,910
I was able to become one,
so I think anyone probably can.

116
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,080
You're supposed to be scared at first.

117
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,170
That's how I was, too,
before I got way too strong.

118
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,960
A hero who's too strong...

119
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,340
That's great.

120
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,130
Can I ask you one more question, Saitama?

121
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:12,550
Sure.

122
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,930
Will you make me your disciple?

123
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,950
Absolutely not.

124
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:25,060
Damn it... I can't fight him effectively
because he's covered in spikes.

125
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,710
What am I supposed to...

126
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,610
Prisoner! Don't punch him
with your bare hands!

127
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,800
Use the steel ball attached to your leg!

128
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,790
Hit him with that!

129
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,910
Thank you for all your passionate
cheers, fiery youth!

130
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:40,910
I'll go up there to kiss you all later,
so make sure you just stay on the roof!

131
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,810
It's no use... He can't hear us.

132
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:46,540
Is there really a reason
he has to fight naked?

133
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:51,000
Ah, the young men cheering me on,
despite putting themselves in danger...

134
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,050
I will not let your love go to waste!

135
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,010
Love...

136
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,020
I see.

137
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,300
I get it now.

138
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,770
If I just give him all my love
and take in all the pain...

139
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,730
There's no need to be afraid anymore!

140
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,150
Angel Hug!

141
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,870
Is it me, or is he staring at us really
intently... covered in blood?

142
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,040
Hello, this is Puri Puri Prisoner.

143
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,190
What?

144
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,920
My honeys have been taken
from our sweet home?

145
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,550
Where is that monster right now?

146
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:33,900
They disappeared?

147
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:38,420
Yeah... They all suddenly
disappeared about 30 minutes ago.

148
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:43,310
They suddenly started wreaking havoc,
then suddenly disappeared?

149
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,020
What are they trying to do?

150
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:50,130
Damn it. I can't believe I missed
something so important.

151
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:53,980
All the other heroes were fighting
out here. What the hell was I doing?

152
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,270
I can't call myself a hero
if I don't defeat monsters.

153
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,160
No, wait.

154
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:05,120
It's not like I'm fighting monsters
because I want to be called a hero.

155
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,630
I feel like I'm forgetting
something very important.

156
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,270
Like why I became a hero...

157
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,150
I started this because I was
interested in it, right?

158
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:20,100
But lately, even after joining the
Hero Association, I'm still bored.

159
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,980
The hero hunter piqued my interest a bit.

160
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,060
That's also why I entered that
martial arts tournament.

161
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,200
But fighting with Suiryu and the others,

162
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,110
and even with that super martial arts
monster, didn't make me feel anything.

163
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,740
I didn't gain anything from it.

164
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,260
Saitama?

165
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,330
King.

166
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,140
You sure it's okay for you to be out here?

167
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:55,250
Yeah. I guess there was some kind of
warning, but it's super quiet now.

168
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,010
What's up? You seem really down.

169
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,730
I was just thinking.

170
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:05,140
I see. But you're still young,
so you shouldn't lose hope.

171
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,520
King...

172
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:11,660
I mean, it might still grow back. And there
are plenty of hair growth formulas...

173
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,400
Wait, wait. That's not even
what I'm talking about!

174
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,020
This is a much bigger problem.

175
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,390
Really? Doesn't sound like you.

176
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,560
You're the invincible Saitama.

177
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,370
Apparently, I can't get any stronger.

178
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,370
Huh?

179
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,940
I became too strong.

180
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,290
I don't feel anything,
no matter who I fight.

181
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:35,130
I get nothing from it. There's nothing
I can learn from anyone else.

182
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:39,590
But isn't becoming that strong
an amazing feat in itself?

183
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,590
King... If you can't grow anymore,

184
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:47,060
it also means that you can't
enjoy growing anymore, either.

185
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,270
No matter how many monsters I defeat,

186
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,100
deep inside, I'm bored out of my mind.

187
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,650
I never thought being a
hero would be so lonely.

188
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,390
You're lonely, Saitama?

189
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,370
Yeah.

190
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,370
Why don't you check out the ballroom
dancing school in front of City Z Station?

191
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,800
Huh? Why?

192
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,410
Just make some friends if you're lonely.

193
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:14,530
Uh, that's not the issue here.

194
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,040
Why not?

195
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:18,510
Why not? Because... I'm not interested.

196
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,950
I mean, I'm not that bored lately.

197
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,320
Then why not take a vacation
once things settle down,

198
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,430
for a change of pace?

199
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,110
Vacation?

200
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,810
I can't think of anywhere
I really want to go.

201
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,040
Good grief.

202
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,460
You say you're bored,
but you refuse to do anything.

203
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,620
You seek stimulation, but you
refuse to challenge yourself.

204
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,440
I was like that in the past, too.

205
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,430
Listen up, Saitama.

206
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,880
Life is an endless journey.

207
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,300
In order to see something new,
you need to open up that path yourself.

208
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,990
Have you even traveled anywhere before?

209
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:57,780
I think you've mistaken becoming strong
with reaching your destination.

210
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:02,710
I don't think the endgame
for a hero is that simple.

211
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,090
Like you can talk to anyone
about being a hero...

212
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,060
Seeking satisfaction from fighting
is fundamentally wrong.

213
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,940
Being courageous and taking action
for the sake of others should be

214
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,400
what truly gives a hero their meaning.

215
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,270
He's actually making sense.

216
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:26,450
In that respect, you're still
not the ultimate hero, Saitama.

217
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,320
You're right.

218
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:36,040
Which means much remains for you
in the pursuit of your highest ideals.

219
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,860
It also means saying that you
have no more room to grow

220
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,710
is just shallow and arrogant,
don't you think?

221
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,220
King...

222
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,910
Ahem.

223
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,940
What does the ultimate hero need?

224
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,940
An unwavering sense of
justice, the power to fight,

225
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,230
and the courage to face all obstacles...

226
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,890
Until you can find the true
answer to that question,

227
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,480
you don't have time to
say that you're bored.

228
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,570
At least, that's what I think.

229
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,690
I also read that in a manga.

230
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,860
You're amazing, dude.

231
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,330
The ultimate hero...
Think about my ideals, huh?

232
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:18,250
That sounds even more boring.

233
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,290
If you're that bored, want to
come over and play some games?

234
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,590
Uh, I'm really not in the
mood for that right now.

235
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,710
Everything I do just makes
me feel empty inside.

236
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,180
Oh, come on. Let's do it.

237
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,350
You want to lose sometimes,
don't you? I'll make you lose.

238
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,250
It's no use trying to provoke me.

239
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,660
It's not like I get mad when
I lose at video games.

240
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,390
It doesn't even frustrate me.

241
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,990
My emotions are waning, you know.

242
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,900
I see. Then how about this?

243
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,860
I'll only use one finger on
each hand as a handicap.

244
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,950
No takebacks!

245
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,240
I'm gonna crush you this time!

246
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,660
To think the tables would
turn on me like that...

247
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:03,960
His power and speed were both far
greater than I'd ever imagined.

248
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,670
I was lucky to even escape.

249
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:10,950
Although... using human martial arts
against a four-legged fighting style

250
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,220
put me at a disadvantage.

251
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,180
I definitely learned something.

252
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,130
That was so much fun, I can
barely contain myself!

253
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:21,650
I can become even stronger!

254
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,980
That's...

255
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,150
There's no doubt about it.

256
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,030
I couldn't ask for a
better chance than this!

257
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,490
My body still moves,
and I can't feel any pain.

258
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:36,700
Actually, I'm so excited that I can
feel my strength welling up within me!

259
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,580
King, I'm going to hunt you!

260
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,540
Predict his next move!

261
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,920
I have it! Prepare to die!

262
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,510
Do you know the guy who
just tried to attack you?

263
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,640
No... I haven't the slightest.

264
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:00,770
Jeez, there's no end to it if you
have to deal with punks like that.

265
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,760
Come to think of it, have you
heard what's going on right now?

266
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,900
No idea.

267
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,190
I don't know all the details, but there
are monsters wreaking havoc everywhere,

268
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:13,360
and there's also some self-proclaimed
hero hunter who's been hunting heroes.

269
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,500
Apparently, there's a lot going on.

270
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,700
I see...

271
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,180
I've been pretty curious
about this hero hunter guy.

272
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:20,910
Really?

273
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,630
I mean, no other human ever called
themselves a monster, right?

274
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:30,460
It was the same thing when I
started being a hero on my own.

275
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:36,400
So I have my hopes up a little.
He might actually be stronger than me.

276
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,020
I see. Hopefully you'll
be able to meet him soon.

277
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,110
Show yourselves.

278
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,180
Who are you?!

279
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,410
Two against one?

280
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:02,830
You must be prepared to die,
if you have the balls to attack me!

281
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,340
Attack you? That's a bit harsh.

282
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:18,720
Right? You're the last survivor of the
Final 44, Speed-o-Sound Sonic, right?

283
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,520
Are you two from the village?

284
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,850
We're from the Golden 37. I'm Tempest Wind.

285
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,190
I'm Hellfire Flame.

286
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,490
What do you want with me?

287
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,730
We're here to recruit you.

288
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,230
Want to do something big with us?

289
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,050
Something big?

290
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:35,570
Yes.

291
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,740
We're going to take over this world...

292
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,700
as monsters who have surpassed humanity.

293
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,560
There is an association called the Monster
Association that only accepts monsters.

294
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,330
We are members there.

295
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,170
The world is about to
be flipped upside-down.

296
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,700
This all sounds like nonsense.

297
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,090
Why are you inviting me?

298
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,930
We want to defeat
Flashy Flash once and for all.

299
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:00,930
Help us do that.

300
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:05,270
Don't make me laugh. I have neither
the obligation nor the time to do that.

301
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:08,270
Get lost if you don't want to die.

302
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,400
I guess we'll just have to show you, then.

303
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,610
We mentioned the Monster
Association, didn't we?

304
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:14,980
We're also...

305
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,740
...monsters.

306
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,450
All it takes is becoming a monster.

307
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,950
No drugs or surgery can
even come close to this.

308
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,170
Are you interested in powering up now?

309
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,210
A monster cell.

310
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,130
All you need to do is ingest
this into your body.

311
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,370
I'll give it to you.

312
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,230
We'll be waiting for you at
the Monster Association.

313
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:49,350
No matter how much more I train,
I can't see myself defeating him.

314
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,940
But I want to defeat
Saitama, no matter what.

315
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,650
And to do that...

316
00:18:54,020 --> 00:19:00,860
I'll have to throw away my humanity.
When I lost to him, I basically died.

317
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,610
I have no need to hold on to my humanity.

318
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,710
Saitama, I'm going to become a monster!

319
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:14,940
Some of the monsters are still about,
so the evacuation order is still in effect.

320
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,020
It's been a long day.

321
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,850
One particularly strong
opponent is Martial Gorilla.

322
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,350
He said that he's going to continue attacking

323
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:25,310
Class A heroes until his threat level
is raised from Tiger to Demon.

324
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,020
City W, huh?

325
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,190
Have the heroes in the area
gather and surround him.

326
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,100
There's no need.

327
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:35,370
It'd be a waste to call upon so
many heroes over small fry.

328
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,770
Zombieman!

329
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:40,320
Class S Rank 8
Zombieman

330
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,540
Leave this to me.

331
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,320
R-Right!

332
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,860
Now, then...

333
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,580
Hey! I can't find a single hero!

334
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,580
If my calculations are correct,

335
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,830
the one behind all these incidents
is that organization.

336
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,100
Considering how careless he's being,

337
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,250
I might be able to get him
to lead me to their hideout.

338
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,420
Well, aren't you built like a tank?

339
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,050
Shit! He's going to attack that civilian.

340
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,430
Are you a pro hero?

341
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,330
Sorry?

342
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,640
You're a friggin' gorilla!

343
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,470
Well, so are you.

344
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,620
Wh-What the hell are you?
A freelance monster?

345
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:16,230
What the heck is a freelance monster?
I'm just here to buy some groceries.

346
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,540
Groceries?!

347
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,250
You're a monster! Are you trying
to blend into human society?

348
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,150
You're a disgrace to all monsterkind!

349
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,850
Jeez, that's kinda harsh...

350
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:28,240
If you're going to become a potential
enemy, you can die here and now!

351
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,730
Take your fighting somewhere else.

352
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,980
Changing targets. I'm going
to follow him instead.

353
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:46,180
We ended up spending the whole day
volunteering to take care of the monsters.

354
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,930
I mean, I guess that's actually your job.

355
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:54,040
Say, Bang. Isn't there a chance
that Garo was taken out

356
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,440
by either another hero or a
monster during this whole mess?

357
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,900
That's not possible, Big Bro.

358
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,030
I didn't train him to be that weak.

359
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:08,950
But that's exactly why I have to take
responsibility and defeat him myself.

360
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:14,910
Garo, do you truly understand what
it means to become a monster?

361
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:20,170
If someone else is going to defeat
you, then I should be the one to...

362
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,590
The sun is going to set soon.

363
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:29,660
We've received important
information from Drive Knight.

364
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,640
Information about our current enemy.

365
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,600
They are called the Monster Association.

366
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,740
We're uncertain of their true motive,

367
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:38,420
but they claim to be an association
that opposes the Hero Association,

368
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:41,690
and they have the ability to
turn humans into monsters.

369
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,570
Their leader is called
Orochi the Monster King.

370
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,530
We also have information on the
location of their hideout.

371
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:50,780
The place is City Z, the ghost town.

372
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,910
So, the area that's been
overrun with monsters.

373
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:57,210
But the fact that they kidnapped
an executive's son...

374
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,490
Are they planning to negotiate?

375
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:02,840
I think they're trying to say
that we shouldn't provoke them.

376
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:08,180
They probably thought they could negotiate
with us to stop eliminating them.

377
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,140
True...

378
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:13,140
It all makes sense if the monsters in the
ghost town are conspiring against us.

379
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:19,100
If that's the case, the recent violence can
be seen as some sort of monster protest.

380
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,050
The monsters we're currently dealing with

381
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:25,080
have enough intelligence to work as a group.

382
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:29,350
It's very likely that they
will try to contact us.

383
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,700
Then maybe we should exploit that.

384
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,950
Let's figure out a way to dupe
them and annihilate them.

385
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,630
Let's hear them out first.

386
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,830
Getting the hostage back safely
is still our top priority.

387
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:45,230
Yes. Esteemed Advisor Narinki
is one of our top supporters.

388
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,990
If something were to happen to his
son, he might cut off funding.

389
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:51,180
We must rescue him at all costs.

390
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,390
A message has arrived from
the Monster Association!

391
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:57,750
A message has arrived from
the Monster Association!

392
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,450
Well, what is it?

393
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:02,940
A message has arrived from
the Monster Association!

394
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,500
Hey...

395
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,940
There's something wrong with him.

396
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,730
A message has arrived...
from the Monster Association...

397
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,360
A message has arrived...

398
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:13,630
A message has arrived from
the Monster Association!

399
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,730
It was okay that I cooked this, right?

400
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:31,800
There's no logical way that
I could've eaten it raw.

401
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,950
I'm just not going to think about it.

402
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:42,060
Just you wait, Saitama!

403
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:45,060
*Shortly after, Sonic suffered from diarrhea

404
