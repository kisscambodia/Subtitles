1
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,100
This is your last chance to surrender, Garo!

2
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,610
You're thinking, "This isn't how
it was supposed to go down," huh?

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,350
Well, too bad, hero hunter.

4
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,620
Everyone here is a highly skilled hero
who's stared death in the face before.

5
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,920
I brought together the heroes I admire most...

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,630
so that we can hunt you!

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,790
Highly skilled heroes, eh?

8
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,510
Am I the only one who
finds that line funny?

9
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,790
What about all the Class S heroes?

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,100
The Hero Association still doesn't
understand how dangerous I am?

11
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,380
You all seem like a hodgepodge
I'd find in some value pack.

12
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,810
It's not exciting me at all.

13
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,240
So you only pay attention
to Class S heroes?

14
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,990
Those Class S heroes sure are popular.

15
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,310
The Hero Association treats them
like they're all special, too.

16
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:07,170
Apparently there are even secret briefings
that are only with the Class S heroes.

17
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,000
We're all heroes, so why are
we treated so differently?

18
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,750
Because we have rankings,
there's a hierarchy,

19
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,110
and there are plenty of talented
heroes who go unnoticed.

20
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,650
There are valuable heroes
who aren't Class S heroes.

21
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,960
That's right. Since you made a name for
yourself by defeating Class S heroes,

22
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,860
you're the perfect target to
let the world know just that!

23
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,340
So you didn't invite any Class S heroes

24
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,340
because you wanted to make
a name for yourselves?

25
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,740
I bet some kids would be
disappointed to hear that.

26
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,490
It's hard to breathe...
I'm getting dizzy, too.

27
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,120
Is it the poison?

28
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,910
Looks like the Monster Association
is causing a fuss right now.

29
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,770
You sure you have time
to mess around with me?

30
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,840
Shouldn't you be concentrating
on rescuing the hostage first?

31
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,170
Of course, we're going after the Monster
Association right after we deal with you.

32
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:08,810
We'll teach all those monsters who are
getting full of themselves a lesson.

33
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,810
These guys are a staircase.

34
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,740
They're a staircase I have to climb
in order to become a real monster.

35
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,280
I won't go back down!

36
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,180
Looks like the poison's circulated.

37
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,670
You must be reaching your limit.

38
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,380
I'll walk over them all, one by one,

39
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,010
and make my way up!

40
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,260
Did you see Justice Man yesterday?

41
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,660
He finally used his new special
move! Justice Fire Kick!

42
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,770
It was so cool!

43
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,950
Also, that one part was hilarious.

44
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,860
When Crab Demon died.

45
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:26,230
Yeah, the way it reacted when Justice Man
showed no mercy to the eggs it was hiding!

46
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,740
Crab Demon put up a good fight, though!

47
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,770
When Mach Woman and
Little Justice joined the fight,

48
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,150
Crab Demon had to face all three of
them alone, and it still held its own!

49
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,930
What?

50
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,110
Why are you rooting for Crab Demon?

51
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,930
Because Crab Demon just wanted
to protect the beautiful ocean!

52
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,180
It was fighting on its own just for that!

53
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,310
If it were just a little stronger,
it would've won...

54
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,020
It must've felt so disappointed...

55
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:03,400
Everyone's Dignity

56
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,610
Now!

57
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,870
Ankle Noose!

58
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,080
Earth Rotation of Doom!

59
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:11,950
What?

60
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,790
Chain Toad!

61
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,590
He got me!

62
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,630
He's got a blade!

63
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,150
What? I'm not allowed to have one?

64
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,930
Talk about unfair.

65
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,230
He's been shot in one leg, and the
poison should be taking effect...

66
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,230
Be careful!

67
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,610
Leave it to me!

68
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,140
Pile Bison!

69
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,410
Get back!

70
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,870
What? When did—

71
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,540
Damn it!

72
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,990
He figured out the timing! But...

73
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,750
He's wide open from the front!

74
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,420
Shit!

75
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,430
Damn it! Put me down!

76
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,720
Sing, Bamboo Shoot!

77
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,270
That's half of you.

78
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:29,030
Death Gatling, it won't be
so funny if we all lose.

79
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,490
We shouldn't worry about
taking him alive anymore.

80
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:35,660
Yeah. He chose that for himself.

81
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,190
He can still move at that speed?

82
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,760
He should be pretty weakened by now,

83
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,220
yet somehow we're on the ropes.

84
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:54,300
It definitely doesn't feel
like we're fighting a human!

85
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,570
Stinger! Fight me one-on-one!

86
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,180
Looks like he chose me!
Everyone else, stay out of this!

87
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,610
No! We all need to—

88
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,230
I'll fill you with holes!

89
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,900
What?!

90
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,620
Thank goodness Stinger is
as stupid as I'd heard.

91
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,690
How dare you?!

92
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,120
Out of the way!

93
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,620
I'll take care of him!

94
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,460
Garo can't dodge my fire right now!

95
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,300
Get away from Garo!

96
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,380
Hey, what's wrong?

97
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,310
You sure wanted to get up close and
personal earlier. Don't run away now.

98
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,020
You're making me lonely here!

99
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,610
I can't get away!

100
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,050
He's...

101
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:47,820
...trailing Megane!

102
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,320
At this rate...

103
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:57,930
Now that our formation has been broken,
am I just holding everyone back?

104
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,270
This newbie is holding us back.

105
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:07,540
We shouldn't have to split
our earnings with him.

106
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,220
O-Oh, that's fine. You guys can have it...

107
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,020
It's all over...

108
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,380
I'm going to be killed!

109
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,430
I'm not cut out to be a hero...

110
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:43,370
I'm just a commoner... I'm at my limit!

111
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:47,170
Who the heck decides what
your limit is, anyway?

112
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,130
If you have the time to break down,

113
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,470
you're better off moving forward.

114
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,910
Back then, I decided that I would change.

115
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,390
Just like him!

116
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,770
If I'm just going to be used as a
shield, I'll fight you head-on—

117
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,730
Yeah, there you go. You can do it.

118
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:14,280
You're pretty confident
in your stamina, right?

119
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,320
You bastard!

120
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,860
It's a trap, Stinger!

121
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,700
Still, I can't just abandon him!

122
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:24,500
Gigantic Drill Stinger!

123
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,010
To think you'd get rid of
your shield yourself...

124
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,520
Now I won't have to worry about
others getting caught in my fire.

125
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,610
This is the end, Garo the Monster!

126
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,070
There's a kid inside the shack.

127
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,480
If you shoot from there,
he'll be caught in the crossfire.

128
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,240
Of all the things you could possibly say...

129
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,370
As if I'd believe a cheap lie like that!

130
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,080
Watch carefully.

131
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,050
Witness the moment the monster is victorious!

132
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,000
Justice will prevail.

133
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,140
Die!

134
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,860
Death Shower!

135
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,210
Why?!

136
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,490
Why can't I hit him?

137
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,410
O-Old dude...

138
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:50,120
Tch... Talk about a ridiculous
amount of bullets.

139
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,960
There's no point in taking aim again.

140
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:57,920
I know that was your Death Shower,
which requires you to fire all your bullets.

141
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,090
So he was provoking me, as well?

142
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:04,840
Any monster that attack hits
becomes mincemeat...

143
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,090
Or apparently not.

144
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,530
Thanks.

145
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,480
You just proved that
firearms can't defeat me.

146
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,050
"This shouldn't have happened," right?

147
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,700
Too bad for you, you stooges.

148
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:25,070
Guess you should've called for a
Class S hero or two, after all.

149
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:29,910
The situation might've been different
if you had even one of them.

150
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,990
Class S, my ass...

151
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,900
Are you telling me every
other hero is second-rate?

152
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,760
It's true. Class S heroes are amazing.

153
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,390
But we're also heroes who are
risking our lives to fight!

154
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,990
Look at me!

155
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,270
The one who has the hero hunter cornered

156
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,580
is me, the Class A hero, Death Gatling!

157
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,270
Talk about jaded.

158
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,340
I'm going to defeat you...

159
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,280
so I can prove our worth!

160
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,150
The only one who cares about ranks

161
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,200
is you, dumbass!

162
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,580
Pathetic...

163
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,410
You're so pathetic.

164
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,700
O-Old dude...

165
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,380
Oh...

166
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,990
You're still alive.

167
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,420
Hey!

168
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,500
Somebody help!

169
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,610
W-Water...

170
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:07,590
I came in response to a call for backup.

171
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,560
From the looks of things, you're the
hero hunter I've heard about.

172
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:19,340
I'm going to eliminate you.

173
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,510
Machine Gun Blows!

174
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,000
Fist of Flowing Water, Crushed Rock!

175
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,450
Die!

176
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,990
You asshole... You buried
yourself to lure me in.

177
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,450
This man...

178
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,480
was able to dodge immediately
by using a leg move

179
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,050
with Fist of Flowing Water, Crushed Rock.

180
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,560
I see.

181
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,950
No wonder he's been giving
the other heroes trouble.

182
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,660
Sweet! I've finally got this!

183
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,210
You've only got a sliver of HP left, King.

184
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:45,110
Guess I just might be stronger now.

185
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,700
Oh? You're still going to fight back?

186
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,950
Wait. Calm down, me.

187
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,290
I just need one more hit and I win.

188
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,240
There's no way he could actually
turn the tables at this point—

189
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,780
K.O.!

190
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,820
How was that?

191
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,460
I let you think you had a chance.

192
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,670
Did you have a little fun?

193
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:09,430
I won't let you have the win, but I don't
mind letting you have that, at least.

194
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,930
Your moves are way too simple, Saitama.

195
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:14,690
You end up button-mashing
even when you have a chance,

196
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,750
so I can still win,
even with my eyes closed.

197
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,930
That makes it 81 wins and 0 losses for me.

198
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,230
You should practice some. I'll let you
borrow my console and everything.

199
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,090
Games can be pretty stressful, huh?

200
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,030
You'll feel much better
when you win one day.

201
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,950
Don't break it, okay?

202
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,660
Hey, that thing's buzzing.

203
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,350
So it is.

204
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:35,990
Is it a monster?

205
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,950
Good. Let's go kick its ass!

206
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:42,530
Looks like some other Class S
heroes already headed there.

207
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,750
It's probably over by now.

208
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,990
But that aside, Saitama,

209
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,700
it's really scary that a bunch of monsters
are passed out by your house.

210
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,700
That can't be very sanitary.

211
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,930
I'll have Genos set them on fire later.

212
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:03,440
But anyway, I wonder why so many
monsters pop up around here.

213
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:06,230
City Z's hazardous area ahead
Absolutely no trespassing

214
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,230
That's probably why no one lives in this area.

215
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,810
If monsters keep showing up
in hordes in multiple cities,

216
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,780
more places might end up like this.

217
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,960
By the way, where's Genos?

218
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,570
Oh, yeah. He hasn't been
home since yesterday.

219
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,770
Huh? Is he okay?

220
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,290
Something called the Monster
Association apparently showed up.

221
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,670
Maybe someone took him out yesterday...

222
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,210
I'm sure he's fine. He's Genos, after all.

223
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:38,510
Noodle
Soup

224
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,850
Guess I'll check it out anyway.

225
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,480
A Class S hero showed up?

226
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,940
Thank goodness...

227
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,760
He's strong...

228
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,340
He's got incredible speed and the same
level of power as Tank-Top Master.

229
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,240
He also keeps blasting that heat cannon of his.

230
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,690
He's a pain in the ass to deal
with in my current condition.

231
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,750
Damn it...

232
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,250
Give it up. There's no way
you can escape from me.

233
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:17,180
Those moves... Remember that guy's moves...

234
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,470
His movement pattern changed.

235
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,350
He's moving on all fours?

236
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:25,770
Shake.

237
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:30,650
I've always been pretty good with
handling high-tech machinery!

238
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,280
Especially breaking them!

239
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,250
It's no use.

240
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,620
One after another...

241
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,500
Looks like I've caught the
attention of all the heroes.

242
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,550
I'm glad to be such a celebrity now.

243
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,330
Currently,

244
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:59,090
the world is in chaos due to the emergence
of the evil Monster Association.

245
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:06,070
Everyone in the Hero Association should
be working together to defeat them.

246
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:12,140
We don't have time to deal
with small fry like you.

247
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,900
Who are you calling a small fry?!

248
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,320
Then help me out, Demon Cyborg.

249
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,660
If I take you down, society
will fear me more, right?!

250
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:41,340
Let everyone know that there's no
hero who'll stand a chance...

251
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:46,600
Because the ultimate monster is right here!

252
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,020
There's no such thing.

253
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,980
Now!

254
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,150
Back up the hero hunter!

255
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,580
What the hell?

256
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,230
The Monster Association is here.

257
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,710
We've come for you, Garo.

258
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:07,150
You seem to be in a bit of trouble.
We'll help you out.

259
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,500
You dumbasses again?

260
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:13,510
Our higher-ups are saying they want to
welcome you into the upper echelon.

261
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,900
Good for you.

262
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,710
Not interested.

263
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,920
Get lost.

264
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,090
No, no, we can't do that this time.

265
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,640
We're under orders ourselves, you see.

266
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:26,470
No way!

267
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:35,900
To think that the hero hunter had
connections with the Monster Association...

268
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,690
Huh?

269
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,650
I lost yesterday,

270
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:42,530
but I learned that there are still monsters
with powers way beyond my comprehension.

271
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:47,040
I will never let my guard down
again whenever a threat shows up.

272
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,780
Tch.

273
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,910
And today...

274
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,920
I'm much stronger than yesterday.

275
00:19:55,210 --> 00:20:00,470
Master Saitama told me to mentally train
myself to achieve the height of herodom.

276
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,570
I'm just starting to understand what he meant.

277
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,970
This isn't enough to defeat me.

278
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,220
Master Saitama?

279
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:12,310
He's the ultimate hero. No monster
could stand a chance against him.

280
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,980
He actually exists.

281
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,520
Incinerate.

282
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,530
Genos.

283
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,280
Bang?

284
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,370
Do you mind letting us handle this?

285
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:36,080
Fist of Whirling Wind, Slashing Steel!

286
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,840
Leave the monsters to me, Bang.

287
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,090
You take care of Garo!

288
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,410
Thanks, Big Bro.

289
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,390
Now, then...

290
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,110
Long time no see, Garo.

291
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,280
That voice...

292
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,860
Looks like the geezer who's going to
be the biggest pain in my ass is here.

293
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,540
Just look at you...

294
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,920
I'll end this now.

295
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,120
Come at me!

296
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,730
Are you strong?

297
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:41,350
Who the heck is this rude little kid?

298
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,220
This little...

299
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,280
Shall I throw him out?

300
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,220
Nah. Give him something
to eat once he wakes up.

301
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,290
Make sure he gets his fill.

302
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:15,220
Fist of Flowing Water, Crushed Rock!

303
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:50,250
Cleaning Up the Disciple's Mess
