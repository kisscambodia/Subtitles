1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,730
You've lost contact with Metal Bat?

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:08,190
Yes. I've already contacted every
hero higher than Class A for backup.

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,740
The giant monstrous insect Centichoro...

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,530
Threat level: Dragon.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,160
It's basically a full-scale disaster.

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,940
This is nothing like two years ago.

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,750
I'm not sure we can defeat it,
despite our numbers.

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,760
Apparently, King is already
fighting something.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,500
What are the other Class S heroes doing?

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,210
Urgent messages from the branch offices?

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,050
Th-This is...

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,010
Damn it! We're cornered.

13
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,470
At this rate... we're finished.

14
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,630
Wait!

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,150
Class S Rank 6
Metal Knight

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,210
It's the Class S hero, Metal Knight!

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,240
We're saved!

18
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,980
You're in the way!

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,460
Weapons tests aren't for show.

20
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,860
Leave at once.

21
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,370
S-Sorry!

22
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:08,000
It's unharmed... For a living
organism, it's extremely tough.

23
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,570
Annoying fly!

24
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,510
Did the centipede thing stop chasing us?

25
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,320
Yeah. I think we might
just make it out of here.

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,470
I hope Metal Bat is okay.

27
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,510
Smash

28
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,450
You're not getting away, pro heroes.

29
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,100
Leave that family behind.

30
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,140
Monsters?!

31
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:33,980
Interesting. It's been reported that
Metal Bat is facing off with Centichoro,

32
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,110
so where is he now?

33
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,760
Unbelievable.

34
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,600
Monsters whose threat levels are Demon
and above have randomly appeared

35
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,580
in multiple locations.

36
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,940
We can't keep up with them.

37
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:30,040
Martial Arts Tournament

38
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,260
As I figured, you're already pretty beat-up.

39
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,700
I wanted to see just how strong you are,

40
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,230
but I don't think that's
going to happen right now.

41
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,730
Don't underestimate me!

42
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,870
You've lost so much blood.
You'll probably pass out at any second.

43
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,270
Not to mention you've
got multiple fractures.

44
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,540
What's keeping you upright?
Your pride as a hero?

45
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,970
His swings are even faster now.

46
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,820
They're also more powerful.

47
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,770
Don't tell me he's...

48
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,860
No, there's no doubt about it.

49
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,870
The more damage he takes,
the more his physical abilities improve.

50
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,200
What's the principle behind your strength?

51
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,960
Who the hell cares about principles?

52
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,710
I'm just pumped up.

53
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,380
The hell?

54
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,460
Just come at me already, hero hunter.

55
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,100
I've still got a giant centipede to
deal with after I'm through with you!

56
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,930
He's still...

57
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,800
Let's see how long you can stay pumped up.

58
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,520
I'll play with you for a bit.

59
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,740
I'm over here!

60
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,570
Dumbass!

61
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,780
I can't forgive muggers or hero hunters.

62
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:13,040
You're rotten to the core,
and I'll beat that right out of you!

63
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,580
You ain't gonna hit me, dumbass!

64
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,920
Are you just going to keep swinging
that thing around until you die?

65
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,900
Until I die?

66
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,250
I'm not that nice.

67
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,700
I'll swing it until I win!

68
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,650
Killer Move... Pumped-Up Brutal Tornado!

69
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,190
Brutal Tornado

70
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,060
Huh? You're just spinning around in circles!

71
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,230
Don't make me laugh!

72
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:48,280
Unfortunately for you, I can deflect
every one of your amateurish blows.

73
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,760
He finally went down.

74
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,720
Tank-Top Master and Metal Bat
are both just musclebrains.

75
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,320
They lack hand-to-hand martial arts skills.

76
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,930
Crushing the Hero Association
might be easier than I thought.

77
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,600
You've got to be kidding me.

78
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:24,070
Did his attacks pack more
of a punch than I thought?

79
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,370
I might've been in trouble if he'd
managed to land one on me.

80
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,240
Big Brother!

81
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,100
Big Brother Bat.

82
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,440
What are you doing?

83
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,540
Who is that?

84
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,690
His little sister?

85
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,420
Zenko, stay back!

86
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,630
Big Brother!

87
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,220
You missed the perfect opportunity.

88
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,470
This time, I'll finish you off for good!

89
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,800
You can't!

90
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,850
Big Brother promised me that he'd
never expose me to violence!

91
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,140
So no more fighting!

92
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,290
Huh?

93
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,860
The fight's over!

94
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:08,150
And why the hell should I have
to follow your family rules?

95
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,950
No more!

96
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,750
Oh, yeah. I just remembered
I had something else to do.

97
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,710
I don't have time to waste on you fools.

98
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,670
You're the one who attacked me!

99
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,630
Guess you get to live a
little longer, Metal Bat.

100
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,580
What?!

101
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,150
Big Brother! Let's hurry up and go home!

102
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,630
There's a giant monster, too.

103
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,060
Oh, right! That family's in danger.

104
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,060
I have to hurry.

105
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,720
Wait, you're joking, right?

106
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,120
Come on! Don't do this!

107
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,950
You're gonna die!

108
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,020
You go on home, Zenko.

109
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,110
Ugh! You stubborn oaf!

110
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,520
Huh? Big Brother?

111
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,220
Hello?

112
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,450
So that's the hero hunter
everyone's talking about.

113
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,170
Not bad for a human.

114
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,170
He's a coward for not finishing him off.

115
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:12,010
No, that guy may actually
prove useful, Hedrojellyfish.

116
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,940
Hey, that's Metal Bat's little sister.

117
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,350
The more hostages, the better.

118
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,560
Hey.

119
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,690
So you're the creepy gaze I was sensing.

120
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,580
It's still alive?

121
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,900
Wait a second, hero hunter!

122
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,700
Two on one, eh?

123
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,680
We are not your enemies.

124
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,540
I'm sure this will interest you.

125
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,160
The Monster Association?

126
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,250
He took the bait.

127
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,490
Follow me. I'll take you to our lair.

128
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,050
I'm not interested. Get lost.

129
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,430
I'll pretend I didn't see that.

130
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,600
But we'll be meeting again.

131
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,100
As long as you continue
hunting heroes, that is.

132
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,770
Just you wait!

133
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,110
Disgusting.

134
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,110
Well, this is a disappointment.

135
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,780
My Mohipunch...

136
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,320
My Pine-a-pow...

137
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,320
Pineapple gets five points.

138
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,830
Smash

139
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,830
Mohican gets two. That's out
of a hundred, by the way.

140
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,830
You're unbelievably weak!

141
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:35,180
Do you know how much I've trained my horn
and this body for the destined day?!

142
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,680
Well, do you?!

143
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,580
Rhino Wrestler, get the hostages!

144
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,680
We're heading back!

145
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,140
What the hell? We're not fighting Metal Knight?

146
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:48,440
Correct. That's just a
remote-controlled robot.

147
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,030
Besides, today is not the day.
You're forbidden to act on your own.

148
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:56,970
Okay, fine. Are we taking
both of these guys?

149
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,070
No, just the kid is enough.

150
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,310
D-Don't!

151
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,960
Damn it! Metal Bat asked
us to watch over them!

152
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,040
We'll stop you, even if it kills us!

153
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,370
Okay, you can die, then!

154
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,470
How do you like that, Phoenix Man?

155
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,820
What do you think my threat level is now?

156
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,760
Who knows? Centichoro,
we've fulfilled our objective.

157
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,830
You can fall back!

158
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,810
You're burrowing? I think not!

159
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,040
I will not let go!

160
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,200
This is fine. Today is not not the day.

161
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,160
Get him!

162
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,280
You've got this, Heavy Kong!

163
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,830
Damn it... Backup's not coming.

164
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,290
What the hell is going on?

165
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,390
Are you a Class A hero?

166
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,880
How many of you do I have to
kill to raise my threat level?

167
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,760
Monsters my electricity doesn't affect?

168
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,890
This isn't my lucky day.

169
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,680
Class A hero Lightning Genji...

170
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,850
You're actually very lucky.

171
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,730
The other cities are facing much worse.

172
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,940
What the heck is going on?

173
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,410
Charanko
(Fist of Water Polo, Carbonation)
Green Room

174
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,410
Hey! You're the only one slacking!

175
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,370
We're supposed to make our
entrance now, you moron!

176
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,270
Hurry it up, Charanko!

177
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,260
Okay, let's go.

178
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:34,130
Ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you all for waiting!

179
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,500
The 22nd Super Fight!

180
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,340
Here are all of our entrants!

181
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,590
First up is the Class A Rank 19
hero who's also known

182
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,420
as Lightning Max, entering for the first time!

183
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,430
Max from Hyper Karate!

184
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:53,060
I can only see myself winning.

185
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,190
Our only lady entrant!

186
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,110
Her lightning-speed attacks
could be considered art.

187
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,900
Ring-Ring from Palm Bells Fist!

188
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,400
I want to fight already.

189
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,030
Next is Benpats from
Bad Roads Martial Arts.

190
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,780
And now, one of our top four regulars!

191
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,370
His serpentine arms enclose his
opponent and take them down!

192
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:12,230
The man ranked the lowest of the
Class A heroes, Snek from Snakebite Fist!

193
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,460
Did you have to mention
the lowest rank part?

194
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,710
We still have many more!

195
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:20,090
Always electrifying, Boltane from
Fist of Thunder and Lightning!

196
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,220
Bazuzu from Bazuzu's Nuclear Fist!

197
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,590
Gatling from Many Striking Fists!

198
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,970
The kindred spirit from Sunflower Dojo's
Gentle Art of Self-Defense, Hamukichi!

199
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,600
Dave from Crushing Giant Method!

200
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,230
Rosie from Psychoanalytic Martial Art!

201
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,340
Mentai from Spice Fist!

202
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,360
Jakumen from Giga Pro Wrestling!

203
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,230
Choze from Combat Arts of the Chosen People!

204
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,410
A former student of the Fist of
Flowing Water Crushing Rock,

205
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,820
Sourface from Sourface-Style Kempo!

206
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,780
I'm so nervous, I think I'm gonna puke...

207
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,640
This is his seventh consecutive entry!

208
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,910
Can this man who refuses to give
up finally make it to the top?

209
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,150
Zakkos from Fist of Crazy
Collision, Fierce Truth!

210
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,920
I'm going to get my first
victory and propose!

211
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,170
Next up...

212
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:03,340
We have a man who asked that no one go for
his head on the surveys we handed out.

213
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,620
Did he really come here to fight?

214
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,530
Charanko from Fist of
Water Polo, Carbonation!

215
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,180
Why am I getting booed already?

216
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,960
Isn't that the Class S hero Genos?

217
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,520
Guess he likes martial arts, too.

218
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,550
And now for the strongest
man in Super Fight history,

219
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,620
our returning two-time champion!

220
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,490
His fights are always one-sided.

221
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,150
But according to him, he hasn't even
shown us all his strength yet.

222
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,970
Bakuzan from Art of the Darkness Hellkill!

223
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:33,120
There will finally be meaning
in my victory today.

224
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,770
And we have another unrivaled contender!

225
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:39,270
He's returning for the first
time in seven tournaments!

226
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,960
The young legend who managed
to win four times in a row!

227
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,420
Suiryu from the Dark Body Art!

228
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,420
Yeah!

229
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:49,640
He spent the three years since
he disappeared goofing off,

230
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,140
and apparently he's only after
the prize money this time.

231
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:55,090
Is he so powerful because he
doesn't crave fame or notoriety?

232
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:58,810
However, Bakuzan is also in this tournament.

233
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,550
So that's Suiryu...

234
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:04,230
If I can kill him, I'll be the strongest
man in the history of this tournament.

235
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,490
I can practically feel his
boodlust piercing my back.

236
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:12,120
I actually wanted to fight the guy who
won last year's tournament, though.

237
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,520
Now entering
City Q

238
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:20,460
I wanted to play with someone
stronger if I could.

239
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:24,840
Now that we've introduced our 18
entrants, let the 22nd Super Fight

240
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,050
begin!

241
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,970
Deep breaths, deep breaths...

242
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,010
I'll be fine. I'll be fine. I'll be fine.

243
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,450
Hey, old guy, are you nervous?

244
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,470
Don't call me "old guy"!

245
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,940
I may be your senior,
but I'm twenty, just like you!

246
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,860
Wait, he's younger than me?

247
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,190
Hey, you.

248
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,400
You entered under a style
I'd never heard of.

249
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,220
You must be an amateur.

250
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,910
Don't take martial arts lightly.

251
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,900
Forfeit now,

252
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,820
or I'll make you regret it.

253
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,400
Well, you heard him.

254
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,700
He's talking to you!

255
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,640
You can't even tie your obi right.

256
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,830
You still can't tie it correctly. Here.

257
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:07,220
Super Fight is a premier martial arts
tournament. It's no place for amateurs.

258
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,970
This guy's also a student of the
Fist of Flowing Water, Crushing Rock.

259
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:14,420
What? Him? I see... Seems they'll accept
just about anyone these days.

260
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,310
What?

261
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:19,890
Bang was supposed to be one of
the judges at this tournament,

262
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,120
but he caused a ruckus by canceling
his appearance abruptly.

263
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,270
Master Bang?

264
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:30,580
The man called the strongest man in martial
arts got wrapped up in being a hero.

265
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,520
That's enough out of you!

266
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,650
And wait, why aren't you the one who's mad?!

267
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,080
Huh?

268
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:39,000
I already left the dojo, but you're
the only student who stayed behind!

269
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,600
Oh, right. I mean,
just let him say whatever.

270
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,210
What?!

271
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,190
I didn't come here to argue.

272
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,850
If you're threatening to crush
me, I'll look forward to it.

273
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,430
You don't look very strong, though.

274
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,840
Wow, way to put him in his place, Charanko.

275
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,680
I'll beat you to a pulp.

276
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:03,560
I'm fine with tracking down Garo,
but is he really going to show?

277
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:07,870
Wow, you're definitely annoyed.

278
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:14,110
The Class A hero we were tracking
is being attacked by someone.

279
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,910
What? Let's go!

280
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,200
Boxing

281
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,830
I, the Boxing Demon,
shall destroy this city!

282
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,980
Guess it wasn't Garo.

283
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:27,170
Stand back, Bomb.

284
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,570
Silverfang? Perfect timing!

285
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:33,630
We should team— Huh? Um...

286
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,390
You must be a Class S hero!

287
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,350
I know you! You're a famous martial artist!

288
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,440
When I was human, I also
learned martial arts...

289
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,270
but fighting in competitions
just wasn't enough!

290
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:49,440
That's right! I wanted to let loose with all
the strength I have, so I turned into a mon—

291
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,610
D-Damn, he's strong...

292
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:01,910
Let's hurry, before he ends up like this.

293
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,170
And now, let us begin round one!

294
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,170
Round 1
Max vs Ring-Ring

295
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,880
Max versus Ring-Ring!

296
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,590
Fight!

297
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,470
Ring-Ring makes the first move!

298
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,710
Heart Hard Hit!

299
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,010
She did all that with
one stroke of her whip?

300
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:26,940
You're a fool for thinking you could
actually take me, Super S, on!

301
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:30,570
You pitiful, foolish hero brats!

302
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,190
H-Heavy Kong has been...

303
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:38,730
So this is what a Class A is like?
That was uneventful.

304
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,910
More importantly,
make sure you spread the news

305
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:47,450
that the one who took down
Heavy Kong was me, Martial Gorilla.

306
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,380
There's no end to this!

307
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,930
You're not getting away!

308
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,520
Th-They're the worst possible
enemies I could've faced...

309
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:16,440
I see. Despite the fact that
we're only threat level Tiger,

310
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,870
we can defeat a Class A hero
based on his attributes.

311
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:23,170
I guess we didn't need to go
sneaking around after all.

312
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,610
We got word that Heavy Kong
was defeated in City W.

313
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:30,790
And we still haven't been able to get
a hold of Metal Bat or Metal Knight.

314
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,000
The giant organism that appeared in City I

315
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,560
has grown even bigger and harder
after consuming a large building.

316
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,260
We can't let it run loose any longer!

317
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,880
Poison! The monster that appeared in
City Y is using some kind of paralysis poison

318
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,390
to render the heroes there immobile!

319
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,990
It's no use. There are just too many of them.

320
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,440
At this rate, we're going to be wiped out!

321
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,320
It seems that we, as well as the humans,

322
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,440
miscalculated how powerful the other was.

323
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,750
We are stronger than we expected,

324
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:04,830
and the humans are unexpectedly weak.

325
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,950
Stop! Snap out of it!

326
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,710
Wh-What's wrong, Darkness Blade?!

327
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:13,200
Those who are lashed by my whip

328
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,570
become my love slaves as
a result of the stimulation.

329
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,670
H-Hey, stop this!

330
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:22,840
Now, if you want my love,
fight until you die!

331
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,600
Y-You're...

332
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,500
Oh? Even more suitors to become my slaves?

333
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,520
How titillating!

334
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,870
Wow... If that's all it takes to become a
threat level Demon, today's my lucky day.

335
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,260
So if I defeat you, will that break
your control over those men?

336
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,700
I can do something heroic and have them
in my debt. Two birds with one stone.

337
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,960
It's the Blizzard Bunch!

338
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,550
You're not getting away.

339
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:01,510
Don't tickle my sadism too much.

340
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,850
I'm liable to get overstimulated and kill you.

341
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:08,890
Max KO'd Ring-Ring in no time!

342
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:12,980
Many were skeptical about just how
strong he is as a martial artist,

343
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,550
so he had been placed in the reverse seed,

344
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:19,360
but he managed to win against a
girl without a single scratch!

345
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,090
I wouldn't say without a single scratch...

346
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:25,580
I guess he was still able to fight,
even without explosives in his shoes.

347
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,950
Hey, what the heck is a reverse seed?

348
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,620
The weaker someone looks or is rumored to be,

349
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:34,950
the harder they make it
for them to win the tournament.

350
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:39,550
I see. So they thought he was weaker
than most of the people here.

351
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:42,730
Those who switch from being
a martial artist to a hero

352
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:46,520
are seen as having joined an easier occupation.

353
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:49,970
Winner
Max

354
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,480
What about Bang, then?

355
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,300
Master Bang is a different story.

356
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,500
By the way, you also got the reverse seed.

357
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,440
Huh? Oh, you're right.

358
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:00,150
Zakkos  Charanko  Bakuzan

359
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,190
So it's not that the guys
on each end are strong,

360
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,150
but they're just treating me like I'm weak?

361
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,900
No, those two were definitely strong.

362
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,410
Bakuzan, the one I fight after you,
is favored to win this tournament.

363
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,480
So based on where you've been placed...

364
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,870
you must be weak, too.

365
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:15,900
Round two, Zakkos versus
Charanko, is about to begin!

366
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm gonna kill you...

367
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,800
Ch-Charanko's strong!

368
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,270
Did Zakkos's brain end up
scrambled after that single slap?

369
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:59,890
Actually, I'm not sure
if Charanko's strong...

370
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:03,410
He's weak! Zakkos is just
so pathetically weak!

371
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:06,620
He apparently invited the person
he'd planned to propose to here,

372
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:11,110
but now there's been a huge
change in his life plans!

373
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,530
Whoops. I sorta feel bad.

374
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,540
Oh, we just got some new information.

375
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,540
Breaking News

376
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:19,170
Apparently, that person
never came to the venue!

377
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,620
All clear! They didn't see him!

378
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,330
Oh, thank goodness.

379
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,840
There's nothing good about this...

380
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,270
Things played out as they usually do.

381
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,610
This tournament is likely to end

382
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,860
before Master has a chance to
truly experience martial arts.

383
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,980
Zakkos had pretty good moves.

384
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,180
Guess I know who I'm facing
off with in the finals.

385
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:50,250
