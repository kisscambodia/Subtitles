Danger Prophecy Emergency Countermeasures Team
Explanation Meeting

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,600
Is that true?

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,980
You asked these ruffians for help?

5
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,990
That's what the
Hero Association decided to do?

6
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,290
That's right!

7
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:18,150
We must come together as one to scale
the wall that humanity is now facing!

8
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:26,210
We currently have 390 C Class,
101 B Class, 38 A Class, and 17 S Class heroes!

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,960
That's clearly not enough!

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,510
I'm not asking you to do this for free!

11
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,760
As long as you take care of the monsters,
I'll make sure that you're compensated!

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,330
Don't bother. It's a waste of money.

13
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:40,180
When it comes down to it, none of these
fools are going to be worth anything.

14
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,760
I can't let that comment slide.

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,560
I'm pretty sure I've killed
more guys than you.

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,560
Wanna try me?

17
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,810
These fools...

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,400
lack conviction!

19
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,840
B-But...

20
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,070
Oh, come on.

21
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,990
This thing is spot-on... Totally spot-on.

22
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,280
This so-called great
prophecy really nailed it.

23
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,370
Guess they knew that the worst threat
level, God level, would be upon us.

24
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,610
The old guy's right.

25
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:11,250
Even if everyone here worked together,
you wouldn't be able to kill me.

26
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,960
Huh? And who are you?

27
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,730
I'm Garo. I trained because
I admired monsters,

28
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:20,840
and I've crushed one dojo after another.

29
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,680
Well, what's the holdup?

30
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,710
Come at me all at once.

31
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,310
Let's find out who's the strongest.

32
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,060
That's why I came here.

33
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,690
Don't. This is nonsense.

34
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:32,850
Nonsense?

35
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,400
I've had enough of you. You can leave.

36
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,760
Is that how you treat your guests,
Mr. Lawman of Justice?

37
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,580
Welp, I've made up my mind.
Cowards need to be punished.

38
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,450
I'm about to commit an evil deed

39
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:46,830
and have myself a massacre party.

40
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,640
I'm very sorry to bother you
three, but it's time to work.

41
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,340
Show him the door.

42
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,420
With pleasure.

43
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,440
Come on, old man. Are you sure
you hit me with conviction?

44
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,730
You don't actually need that
if you're strong, though.

45
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,230
Moron!

46
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,280
Not bad!

47
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,090
Great job! Kick their asses even more!

48
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,870
Huh? What the hell are you
riffraff talking about?

49
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,500
You're all going to die, too.

50
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,530
What'd you say?!

51
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,300
You're one of us, too!

52
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,880
You're wrong. Heroes always arrive late,
but monsters are always first to the party.

53
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,050
They show up out of the blue for no reason.

54
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,380
Listen up. You're all on the human side.

55
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,050
I'm on the monster side.

56
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,220
A human calling himself a
monster? You pathetic fool.

57
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,560
I'll send you to a fiery grave!

58
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,110
I do enjoy little tricks like this,

59
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,700
but it's a bit embarrassing when
you know how they work.

60
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,780
That bastard...

61
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,790
Yes. The multi-purpose hall on floor 7
of the central tower of Headquarters.

62
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,770
Send all the heroes currently
in HQ at once. All of them!

63
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:20,880
Taking on a group of Class S heroes
would sorta suck right now.

64
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:27,390
Then again, I think this will suffice
for the debut show of the monster Garo.

65
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,930
You can consider this a declaration of war.

66
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:35,150
I'll return in six months, even stronger.

67
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,220
See ya.

68
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,910
You know what you have to do?

69
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,770
Yes, ma'am!

70
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,540
Class B Rank 2
Eyelashes

71
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,540
Class B Rank 3
Wild
Monkey

72
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,680
What are we going to do
if he cops an attitude?

73
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,670
We'll make sure he can never
cop an attitude again!

74
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,970
Very good.

75
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,270
Yes, Lady Blizzard!

76
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:33,700
Human Monster

77
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:32,820
Your rank has increased to
Class B Rank 7, Master Saitama.

78
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,060
I've increased to Class S Rank 14.

79
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,020
All I'm doing is pummeling
monsters I stumble across.

80
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,680
I've gone up that much?

81
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,730
Well, monsters are appearing
on a daily basis now.

82
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,160
Even though you defeat monsters, you aren't
reporting them to the Hero Association.

83
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,530
Your rank is still increasing,
though, so that must mean

84
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:55,290
there are witnesses reporting your
victories to the association.

85
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:01,350
That means you're becoming more
recognized as a hero among the masses.

86
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:04,940
I think you might even have a
fan club soon, Master Saitama.

87
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:10,010
Yeah, right. You're Class S,
and you don't have a fan club.

88
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,470
Actually, I do have a fan club.

89
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,680
Seriously?

90
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,850
I detect something approaching.

91
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,100
Humans can't move that
fast. Is it a monster?

92
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,910
Oh, hey. An item.

93
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:26,030
Master seems a bit busy,
so I'll go fight it.

94
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,280
This will be the perfect opportunity
to test out my new parts.

95
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,370
Show yourself.

96
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,330
A human?

97
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,880
What do you want?

98
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,250
Tell Saitama to get out here.
I know he lives here.

99
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,380
Are you an acquaintance of Master Saitama's?

100
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,340
I've run into you before.

101
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,470
I'm Speed-o'-Sound Sonic.
I'm Saitama's rival.

102
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,720
I've come here today to settle the score.
If you understand, then stand aside.

103
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,740
Speed-o'-Sound Sonic?
So it's you, you freak.

104
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,500
You have the nerve to claim
that you're Master's rival?

105
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,440
Shameless.

106
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,940
Take another step and you'll be eliminated.

107
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:09,150
You're the one who's going
to be eliminated, sidekick.

108
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:15,370
C-Crap... I accidentally
saved over King's save data.

109
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,220
20 Minutes Later

110
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,060
I totally took this without asking, too...

111
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,640
Eh, it's fine.

112
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,420
No, I guess it's not... Well, shit.

113
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,840
Class B Rank 7 hero Saitama!
Come out at once!

114
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,330
Class B Rank 1 hero Lady Hellish
Blizzard would like to speak with you!

115
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,760
Oh, yeah, I don't need the newspaper.

116
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,820
We're not salesmen!
We're heroes who outrank you!

117
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,110
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Saitama, the newbie.

118
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,990
I am Hellish Blizzard... and I'm sure
I need no further introduction.

119
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,650
Uh, yeah, I have no idea who you are.

120
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,690
Who are you?

121
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,330
She's Class B Rank 1!

122
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,660
Oh, I see. Good work, I guess.

123
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:58,870
So, what's up?

124
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,040
This guy's attitude is huge!

125
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,490
It appears you're underestimating
us, so let me just warn you...

126
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,750
It's customary for anyone

127
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,770
who makes it to Class B to
come greet Lady Blizzard first.

128
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:14,760
Emergency Alarm

129
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,150
Greet her?

130
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,070
Heya. I'm Saitama.

131
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,220
Pleasure.

132
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,480
Whatever.

133
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:27,690
Did you know there are several factions
within the Hero Association?

134
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:28,930
Factions?

135
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:34,030
You're not going to survive in this
business unless you join a faction.

136
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,320
Uh, what are you talking about?

137
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,290
I'm telling you that you can't
climb the ranks on your own.

138
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:38,990
Why, though?

139
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,360
Because people will get in your way.

140
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,260
Who?

141
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,580
Your rivals!

142
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,180
I don't really know what you're talking
about, but I'm busy right now, so...

143
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,130
I'm not through talking to you yet.

144
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,000
Join me.

145
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,880
Then I'll let you have a
high-ranking position in Class B.

146
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,070
Huh?

147
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,600
Ah...

148
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,330
That's what's going on.

149
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,550
So if I decline, you guys
are going to get in my way?

150
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:08,060
Are you threatening all the
members of Class B like this?

151
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,320
What are you, a gang leader?

152
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,070
No, I only invite the heroes
I see potential in.

153
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,530
Are you scared that I'm going
to take Rank 1 from you?

154
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,610
Don't worry. I'll be in Class A in no time.

155
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,510
Actually, why don't you go to Class A?

156
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,250
Hurry up and give me your answer.

157
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,630
Of course, I decline.

158
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,130
Heroes shouldn't care about hierarchy.

159
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,800
Eyelashes! Wild Monkey!

160
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,550
Yes, ma'am!

161
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:37,010
Hurt him so bad that he'll never
be able to play hero again!

162
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,270
You're not gonna survive like that,

163
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,110
Blizzard.

164
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:55,090
So you insist on getting in my way...

165
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,480
What is this? ESP?

166
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,460
Precisely. You don't seem very surprised.

167
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,840
You're gonna fight me by making
some rocks and pebbles float around?

168
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,670
I wouldn't do that.

169
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,420
I can tell you're mocking me.

170
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,380
Well, you're going to regret that.

171
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,640
I'm gonna kill you so bad,
you'll wish you were dead!

172
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,640
Hellstorm!

173
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,370
This is a cruel attack that
rends flesh, shatters bones,

174
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:33,230
and breaks my opponent's
spirit in an instant.

175
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:38,070
You brought this upon yourself,
because you dared to surpass me.

176
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:41,900
I'm number one! Anyone who gets in my way...

177
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,450
So you're crazy. You don't belong on top.

178
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,490
...will be crushed!

179
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,330
You don't really understand what a hero is.

180
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,750
There are so many extremely
powerful villains in this world.

181
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,750
A hero is someone who
takes on those villains.

182
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,300
Even if they're all alone.

183
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,760
You gather lackeys that are weaker
than you so you'll feel strong,

184
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,530
so you're not cut out for it.

185
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,220
You're going to cry someday.

186
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,560
Factions? Crushing newbies?

187
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,430
Securing your rank?

188
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,440
None of that matters.

189
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,520
Don't underestimate heroes, you jerk.

190
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,600
Shut your mouth!

191
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,980
What could you possibly know about me?!

192
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,170
Huh?

193
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,810
Wh-What just... Ow...

194
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,230
I was chasing a mouse around,

195
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,770
but I somehow ended up in front
of Master's residence again.

196
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,150
That's the S Class Genos.
What's he doing here?

197
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:06,160
I apologize, Master Saitama. It's gotten
rather dusty outside your place.

198
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,290
I think this is a little
more than just dust!

199
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,120
I thought I just saw
Sonic for a split second.

200
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,290
What the hell are you two doing?

201
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,210
You've got connections with S Class heroes?

202
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,050
Huh? You mean Genos?

203
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,510
I'm Master Saitama's disciple.

204
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,170
D-Disciple?

205
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,010
An S Class, a B Class's disciple?

206
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,260
You're B Class Rank 1...

207
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,050
Hellish Blizzard.

208
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,140
I see.

209
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,400
So you've finally made Master a
target of your newbie crushing.

210
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,470
And now, the tables have
turned and you almost died.

211
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:44,510
No... We both just got caught
up in your attack just now.

212
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,200
I see. I do apologize about th—

213
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,910
Exploding Shuriken!

214
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,620
A monster?!

215
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,300
Not exactly, but...

216
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,500
It's starting to get crowded,
so you should go already.

217
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,210
You could throw a hundred of these
at me. They won't do a thing.

218
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,960
You haven't even been able to hit
me once, so stop talking big,

219
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,130
you stupid puppet.

220
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:09,160
Saitama, make sure you watch closely!

221
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,600
After I turn your disciple
into scraps, you're next!

222
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,990
Such murderous intent...

223
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:18,300
And he radiates combat skill
just by standing there.

224
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,320
This guy's dangerous.

225
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,740
Master, this guy is an annoying stalker.

226
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,950
I'll make sure he disappears so that
he can never come back again.

227
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,410
As if a slowpoke like you
could ever erase me.

228
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,870
You still intend to fight me
with that level of ability?

229
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,830
When did I ever show you my true abilities?

230
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,290
You lose.

231
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:54,770
Accelerate.

232
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,560
Genos is a little faster from
the last time we messed around.

233
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,650
Huh? Did he get new parts?

234
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,490
I can't see them at all.

235
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,710
Why do you keep going behind me?

236
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:21,070
Does this brat think he's
actually faster than me?

237
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,720
You had some lint in your hair.

238
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,930
Why, you little—

239
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,850
You let your guard down,
Speed-o'-Sound Sonic.

240
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,560
Machinegun Blows!

241
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,430
He dodged?

242
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:39,730
What?!

243
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,400
You pathetic fool.

244
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,610
How does it feel to hit nothing but air?

245
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:50,950
My special footwork and fast
movement create an afterimage.

246
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,410
I call it Fourfold Funeral!

247
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,160
Die! Scatterflash Slash!

248
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,790
I can't see his movements.

249
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,040
Then I'll just have to
blast this whole area!

250
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:06,840
Incineration Cannons! Full power!

251
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,010
Is it over?

252
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,460
I won? No...

253
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,890
He collapsed before I cut him.

254
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,670
Saitama, you saved your disciple?

255
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,850
You're too soft.

256
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,980
It'd suck if he set off any more
explosions in front of my house.

257
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,000
Besides, there's no reason
for you two to fight.

258
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,450
Genos, are your parts supposed to be
used in some stupid street brawl?

259
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,380
I'm the one Sonic's after.

260
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,330
You're persistent, so I'll fight
you seriously once in a while.

261
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:40,290
Menacing

262
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,290
Come at me.

263
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,770
I've been waiting for this moment!

264
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,320
I've developed the ultimate
technique just to finish you off!

265
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,130
And now I'll show you!

266
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,670
Yeah, go for it.

267
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:55,220
Ultimate technique! Tenfold Funeral!

268
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,720
Ten afterimages?!

269
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,140
He's a joke, but he must've
trained like crazy!

270
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,120
His combat skills are definitely Class S.

271
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,570
As a B Class hero,
Saitama shouldn't stand a chance...

272
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,030
But...

273
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,910
I always feel like I don't stand
a chance when I face you.

274
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,280
I need to win so I can get
rid of that mentality...

275
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,680
or I'll never be able to move on from this!

276
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,200
Killer Move: Serious Series...

277
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,330
Serious Sideways Jumps!

278
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,340
Hurgh

279
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,470
Hurgh!

280
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,890
Wh-What did you just—

281
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,010
I just passed by while doing sideways jumps.

282
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:43,760
Damn it... A powerful shock wave
and countless afterimages...

283
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,480
He was faster than me!

284
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:48,230
I'll get you next time...

285
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,020
Is he dead?

286
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,480
No, I didn't kill him.

287
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,200
He's too strong.

288
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,230
This isn't normal.

289
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,940
I couldn't be number one.

290
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,070
Not in intelligence,
physical strength, practical smarts,

291
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,490
or natural psychic ability...

292
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:14,680
I was supposed to be someone
who stood at the top...

293
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,050
If it weren't for her.

294
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,960
My older sister and the strongest esper...

295
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,590
Tornado.

296
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,020
S Class Rank 2

297
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,020
Terrible Tornado

298
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:31,570
Because of my sister, I've never been
number one at anything in my whole life.

299
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,280
That's why, when I became Class B Rank 1,

300
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,500
I decided that I would stay at this rank,

301
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,730
manipulate heroes under Class B into a group,

302
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,450
Sun Man

303
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,450
and surpass my sister, who
always worked on her own.

304
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:46,370
That stupid brat—
Terrible Tornado is S Class.

305
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:49,250
Why don't you just aim
for Class A Rank 1, then?

306
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,710
Class A is impossible.

307
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:53,670
It's not impossible to get in
the upper ranks of Class A,

308
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,660
but I won't make it to Rank 1.

309
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,450
There's no way.

310
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,290
Class A Rank 4 Bushi Drill.

311
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,720
Class A Rank 3 Okama Itachi.

312
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,620
Class A Rank 2 Iaian.

313
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:11,630
Class A Rank 4
Bushi Drill

314
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:11,630
Class A Rank 3 Okama Itachi

315
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:11,650
Class A Rank 2
Iaian

316
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:09,120
These three swordsmen are disciples of
the S Class hero Atomic Samurai,

317
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,650
and there's a reason they can't
become S Class heroes...

318
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:16,580
The man who's Rank 1 in Class A...
Handsome Kamen Amai Mask.

319
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,070
No one can surpass him.

320
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,180
You must be Suppon. The savage
they found in an ice floe,

321
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:26,790
who was thawed and returned to life.

322
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:32,050
You escaped the laboratory and started
attacking anyone who came close to you.

323
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:32,710
A villain.

324
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,840
The Hero Association asked
me to take you in alive...

325
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:39,000
But I'm not that soft.

326
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,220
A Class Rank 1

327
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,220
Handsome Kamen Amai Mask

328
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,900
Pipe down.

329
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,290
Amai Mask!

330
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,150
You're the best!

331
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,860
You're so strong!

332
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:03,580
There are a lot of monsters in this
world that are beyond human reasoning.

333
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,830
You're quite the monster yourself,

334
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,790
but you're no match for
Handsome Mask or my sister.

335
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,060
There's also the strongest
man in the world, King,

336
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,520
and the person who stands
atop the hero world, Blast.

337
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,300
They're monsters even among monsters.

338
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:20,910
It's difficult for us to move
up the ranks on our own.

339
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,510
So what's wrong with creating factions?

340
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:25,470
Sun Man

341
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,470
Nothing, really.

342
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,580
I just have no intention of
becoming one of your lackeys.

343
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,930
Just because you're a little strong?

344
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:33,220
You'll never make it to the top.

345
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:36,330
I was trying to be nice when
I invited you to my faction.

346
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,820
Hey, Saitama.

347
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,310
Did you happen to take my video game?

348
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,100
K-K-K-King?!

349
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,290
My bad. I did.

350
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,570
I knew it. Give it back.

351
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,170
Uh... I really am sorry.

352
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,250
It's fine, as long as you return it.

353
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,570
I erased your save data.

354
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,840
Huh? Did you just say something?

355
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,920
Why? Why does an S Class look like
he's having fun with a B Class?

356
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,180
Master doesn't team up with anyone,

357
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,440
nor does he compare himself to anyone.

358
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,010
He doesn't care about ranks.

359
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:07,970
Sorry.

360
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,470
Nah, it's okay.

361
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,710
Whoa, the button's smashed in.

362
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,650
But he attracts strong people.

363
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,790
Maybe I could join them...

364
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,540
Because...

365
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:20,780
He's strong.

366
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:58,960
S Class Rank 14 Genos and
B Class Rank 7 Saitama.

367
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,900
Do we agree on their hero names?

368
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,800
No objections!

369
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:08,600
Because Genos aggressively attacks
the most heinous monsters,

370
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,390
his hero name is Demon Cyborg.

371
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:15,060
And based on his appearance,
Saitama's hero name is Bald Cape!

372
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,090
People who want to become heroes
love getting proper hero names!

373
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:21,060
I'm sure they'll be thrilled.

374
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:27,850
Let's look forward to the future endeavors
of Demon Cyborg and Bald Cape!

375
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,620
They spent two hours on
names no one cares about.

376
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:37,290
But the meeting concerning Garo
was finished in fifteen minutes.

377
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:40,210
Those idiotic optimists!

378
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:43,710
You mean the crazy guy who called himself
a monster and caused some trouble?

379
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,840
Don't panic, Sitch.

380
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:52,100
S Class Rank 3 Silverfang is currently
pursuing that human monster.

381
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,420
There's no reason to worry with
that old man on the case.

382
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,180
If all else fails, we still
have Tornado and Blast.

383
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,210
In the end, he's only human, Sitch.

384
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,680
I'm sure he has nothing
to do with the prophecy.

385
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:07,290
Damn it! Is that all we really
need to do to deal with Garo?

386
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:13,200
Damn it... Wh-Who the hell are you?

387
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,950
I'm an A Class hero.

388
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,200
Why are you attacking me?

389
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,910
A Class Rank 9 Tank-Top Vegetarian.

390
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:23,170
I spotted you by chance,
so I decided to go after you,

391
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,670
but I'm seriously disappointed
at how weak you are!

392
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,880
I hope you're prepared.

393
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,380
I'll show you what happens when
you make a hero your enemy...

394
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,990
Looking forward to it...

395
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:40,950
Fighting a monster class hero, that is.

396
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:50,250
The Hunt Begins
