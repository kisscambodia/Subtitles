1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,030
Fist of Flowing Water, Crushed Rock!

2
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,190
Those moves are the perfect
offense and defense alike.

3
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,230
They may be using the same style,
but the difference in skill is obvious.

4
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,550
This battle's already been decided.

5
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:57,920
What the hell? The old man
never fights this fiercely...

6
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,160
Sh-Shit... I'm losing consciousness...

7
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,620
Actually... I'm probably going to die.

8
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,260
Why are you moving so strangely?

9
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,640
Where did you learn that?

10
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,690
You're like a beast.

11
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,300
Not yet...

12
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,640
I can still figure this out if I use him...

13
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,460
Not happening.

14
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,830
I took care of the monsters.

15
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:37,040
Bang, all that's left is Garo.

16
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:45,440
Cleaning Up the Disciple's Mess

17
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,410
I sent in some monsters in
order to take Garo alive,

18
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,250
but the Demon Cyborg...

19
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,590
I didn't expect him to be that strong.

20
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,680
And even Silverfang is here.

21
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,180
This will make it hard to snatch him.

22
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:04,100
But if I go back empty-handed,
Orochi might eat me next.

23
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,060
I need Garo to survive
this on his own somehow,

24
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,520
but I'm not sure things
could be any worse.

25
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,470
Say, Big Bro, if you were him,

26
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,470
would you still be able to stand
after being hurt that badly?

27
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:22,120
If I were 60 years younger,
I could've held on... probably.

28
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,970
Come on! Just a little more!

29
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:25,950
Let's go, Bang!

30
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,780
Damn it... Old Man Bang

31
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,540
is taking advantage of the fact that
his former top pupil is weakened.

32
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,170
Not to mention the other geezer is the
master of the Fist of Whirling Wind,

33
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,970
Slashing Steel, Bomb!

34
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,970
Have they no shame?

35
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,610
Even if I were to beg for my
life in front of these two,

36
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,490
the Demon Cyborg wouldn't let me go.

37
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,010
So if I want to get through this dire situation,

38
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,940
I need to kill all three of them.

39
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,240
That's impossible, though.

40
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:07,690
Know the pain that my top
pupil Charanko felt, Garo!

41
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,160
Let's play heroes!

42
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,080
You wanna play, too, don't you, Garo?

43
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,250
Yeah, let's play!

44
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,450
Huh? Sure.

45
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,050
Bum-ba-bom! Justice Man is here!

46
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:22,760
Hup!

47
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,790
Justice Man Kick!

48
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,350
That's dangerous!

49
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:29,540
Huh?

50
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,220
That's mean!

51
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,200
In that case...

52
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,260
You can be the monster.

53
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:36,870
Huh?

54
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,270
You be the monster.

55
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,650
The hell is this? Am I seeing
my life flash before my eyes?

56
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,140
This is a pretty shitty memory.

57
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,420
This guy is...

58
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,790
Now you get to be the monster.

59
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,120
That's right. Tatsu.

60
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,460
He was the popular kid in class.

61
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,580
Wait, what's going on?

62
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,370
Garo's going crazy.

63
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,130
We were just playing, but
then Garo suddenly got mad.

64
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,500
We were playing heroes,
and Garo got super mad at Tatsu.

65
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,770
What the heck? What's his problem?

66
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,600
Poor Tatsu.

67
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,300
So, what made you so angry?

68
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,940
Well...

69
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,730
I heard you got angry while
playing heroes. Is that true?

70
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,740
That's because Tatsu always...

71
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,900
You can't even tell the difference
between real life and make-believe?

72
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,950
That's not it.

73
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,160
I always have to play the monster and—

74
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,830
You're the one who lost control!

75
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,960
How are you going to take
responsibility for this?!

76
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,580
It's not that I didn't like
playing the monster...

77
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,710
Did I just not like Tatsu playing the hero?

78
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,660
No, that wasn't the problem.

79
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,760
I just learned how unbelievably unfair
things were while we were playing heroes.

80
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,250
Playing heroes is just

81
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,850
supposed to be kids reenacting what they
see on a kids' show. It's make-believe.

82
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,730
It shouldn't matter who plays what role.

83
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,370
Tatsu was the most popular kid in class.

84
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:03,190
On the other hand, I was a loner
who basically kept to himself.

85
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,530
The one to play the hero is decided when
everyone agrees on who it should be.

86
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,070
Of course I'd never get that chance.

87
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,460
Justice Man Cross Chop!

88
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,690
Why the heck are you dodging?

89
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,500
Guys, hold on to Garo for me.

90
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,830
You got it.

91
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,460
Huh?

92
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,370
This should be obvious, but there's no
scenario where the monster actually wins.

93
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,920
I would always lose.

94
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,800
Justice Man Kick!

95
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,140
I've defeated the monster Garo Poop Man!

96
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,020
The system in which the
popular kid everyone loves

97
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,930
beats the crap out of the weak,
loner kid who's hated by everyone...

98
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,530
I can't take it anymore!

99
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,610
Fight me, Tatsu!

100
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,380
Huh? What the heck are you talking about?

101
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,090
I don't want to play the monster anymore!

102
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:57,250
If I win, promise me that you
won't mess with me anymore!

103
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,270
Guys, hold on to Garo for me.

104
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,770
That's not fair! Let me go!

105
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,010
I want to fight Tatsu fair and square!

106
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,280
The others said you suddenly

107
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,020
went crazy when you were
all just playing around.

108
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,460
That's not true.

109
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,540
Tatsu's popular, so everyone's
making me out to be the bad guy.

110
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,150
That's not true! You did a bad thing!

111
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,960
Go apologize to everyone right now!

112
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,760
Justice, my ass. Evil, my ass.

113
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,690
In the end, they were just going to
kill me based on popular opinion.

114
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,070
It's unfair. It's unforgivable.

115
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,260
I'm angry!

116
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,500
I just want to teach them all a lesson!

117
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,460
I want them to feel a blow from the weak!

118
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,920
Screw justice and evil!

119
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,590
It's over, Garo!

120
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:59,270
Like hell... it's over!

121
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,310
What?

122
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,650
Garo...

123
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,700
Bang! Above you!

124
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,710
A monster?

125
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,170
Genos!

126
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,710
Bang! He's a monster now!

127
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,760
I'm going to blast that thing
along with Garo! Got it?

128
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,060
Hear me! I'm taking Garo!

129
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,350
I'm leaving the rest to you!

130
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,560
Spiral Incineration Cannon!

131
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:49,020
Centichoro!

132
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,830
What in the world is that?!

133
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,450
That thing's actually alive?!

134
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,380
Oh, no! We need to get to them!

135
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,280
To think it didn't even suffer a scratch

136
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,490
after being hit by Genos' attack...

137
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,670
That thing's going to be a pain in the ass.

138
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,950
Threat Level:
Dragon

139
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,950
Giant Monstrous Insect:
Centichoro

140
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,910
What the hell do you guys think
you're doing, interfering like that?

141
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,170
Just shut up and let Centichoro handle this.

142
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,120
He's a catastrophe that devours all.

143
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,010
I can't help but admire his
desire to destroy everything.

144
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,640
I see that your endgame is
as weak as ever, hero hunter.

145
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:07,400
When you defeat them, you need to make
sure they aren't breathing anymore.

146
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:11,520
All those heroes on the ground
over there are still alive.

147
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:18,240
But don't worry.
Centichoro will end everything.

148
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,670
Quit interfering!

149
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,990
They're my prey!

150
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,000
Come on, now. Stop squirming.

151
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,160
Damn it! Put me down!

152
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,790
You won't get away with this!

153
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,870
Why are you so angry?

154
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,300
It's your fault for not finishing them off.

155
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:42,060
Getting rid of two Class S heroes at
once works out quite well for us.

156
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,640
They are our greatest enemies, after all.

157
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,800
I'm sure you've seen by now
that some opponents

158
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,360
are better suited for each other than others.

159
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,570
According to our strategist, Gyoro-Gyoro,

160
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:58,010
there are only four heroes who
stand a chance against Centichoro.

161
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:03,790
Terrible Tornado, who has
unparalleled psychic powers.

162
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,750
Metal Knight, who hoards military
might on an unknown scale.

163
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,460
King, the strongest human alive.

164
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,920
And the top hero who nearly killed
Centichoro in the past, Blast.

165
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,920
Centichoro aligned with

166
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,780
the Monster Association in order
to get revenge against Blast.

167
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:29,140
It means that he's determined to
drag Blast out onto the battlefield.

168
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,520
In terms of compatibility between
fighters, those two Class S heroes

169
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,520
don't have what it takes to survive this fight.

170
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,450
Silverfang has unrivaled strength,
but that only applies

171
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:42,530
for opponents of a size that allow
him to use his martial arts.

172
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:46,470
The Demon Cyborg's functionality
is also terrifyingly proficient,

173
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:50,260
but he doesn't have enough firepower
to take down something that big.

174
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,950
Those two don't stand a chance.

175
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,810
He's coming!

176
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:00,700
Genos...

177
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,560
We're counting on you.

178
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,140
Got it!

179
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,180
Whirling Wind...

180
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,400
Flowing Water...

181
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,460
Fist of Roaring Ki, Rending Air!

182
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,630
What an amazing attack...

183
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,720
They broke through that hard exoskeleton...

184
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,550
That is truly the ultimate technique.

185
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:51,230
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!

186
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,310
We let our guard down.

187
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:15,800
But we were able to use the huge
attack that we can only use once.

188
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,720
Thanks, Genos.

189
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,130
It's no big deal.

190
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,560
It looks like it was effective.

191
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,200
That shock is currently
coursing through its body.

192
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,100
I hope you explode into
bits, you stupid monster.

193
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,810
It's over.

194
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,160
Seriously?

195
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,630
He molted!

196
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,360
How is that even possible?!

197
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,630
We can't defeat this! What are we going to do?

198
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,590
We're just outside the city.

199
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:03,630
If we let it go into that area,
civilians are going to get hurt.

200
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,180
Bang.

201
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,760
I'll fight that thing.

202
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:13,980
I'll hold off that centipede for as
long as possible. You guys can run.

203
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:17,440
Genos, I cannot agree to that.

204
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,150
You shouldn't risk your life when
you know there's no way to win.

205
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,990
You young'uns still have a future.

206
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,690
Genos, just make sure you
don't push yourself too hard.

207
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,830
Is that really okay, though?

208
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,170
Of course it's not!

209
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,600
This is too reckless!
Cannons won't work on that thing!

210
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,880
This thing, the monster from
yesterday, and Garo are all

211
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,530
part of the Monster Association.

212
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,600
This battle is inevitable!

213
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,340
Dual Blade Rush!

214
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,340
But that's what it means
to fight against them!

215
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,770
I'll grind you to death!

216
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,760
If that's being reckless, then...

217
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,030
Genos!

218
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,000
At this rate... I'm...

219
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,460
unworthy.

220
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,630
Jet Drive Arrow!

221
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,850
You impudent creature!

222
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,710
What?!

223
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,320
He went into its mouth!

224
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,320
Die!

225
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,620
This is... digestive fluid!

226
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,120
I'll melt you until there's nothing left!

227
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,590
You're the one...

228
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,030
who's going to melt!

229
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:50,800
Ultra Spiral Incineration Cannon!

230
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,190
He did it!

231
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,650
Again...

232
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,260
I cannot...

233
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,410
defeat him...

234
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,290
I cannot protect them!

235
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,990
Run, Big Bro!

236
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,450
It's no use!

237
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,320
What's the matter?

238
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,130
You sure quieted down, hero hunter.

239
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,190
I just don't agree with
how this battle ended.

240
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:14,190
I want to defeat them on my own.

241
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:18,300
Then I would become the
greatest object of fear.

242
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,510
That's the point of being the hero hunter.

243
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,270
Object of fear? You?

244
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,350
You don't have the strength

245
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:31,440
to defy the likes of Centichoro or the
upper echelon of the Monster Association.

246
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,910
Just you wait...

247
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,290
What is it that I'm lacking?

248
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,890
There are still others like him?

249
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:55,300
Is there nothing I can do against
these opponents but just watch?

250
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,380
Bang, this isn't good.

251
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,720
We're going to end up back in the city.

252
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,260
There will be civilian casualties!

253
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,760
Bang?

254
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,940
Big Bro.

255
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,820
I guess it's do or die.

256
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,880
I will exert my life's
last remaining strength!

257
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,340
Courage...

258
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,600
Centichoro!

259
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,700
Hey, you pest!

260
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,440
I brought you Blast,
the guy you've been looking for!

261
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,190
That's King's voice!

262
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,150
Blast?!

263
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,110
Hey, look!

264
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,590
He's turning toward the voice!

265
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,050
Blast?

266
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,230
That's right!

267
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:08,030
The one who beat you so bad that you
pissed yourself as you ran away!

268
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,000
The hero Blast!

269
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:13,480
If you want to fight him
again, come over here!

270
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,290
What's wrong? You scared?

271
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,970
You coward!

272
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,260
Hey, if you're going to shit
yourself, do that at home!

273
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:28,440
Vermin like you should go back into the
ground and suckle on your mama's teat!

274
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,680
Looks like King made it in time.

275
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,400
Yes.

276
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,860
He had mentioned that he wanted
something to provoke Centichoro.

277
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,630
Is he trying to draw him in close
and fight him one-on-one?

278
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,070
I know it's top secret,

279
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,080
but I told him about
Centichoro's grudge against Blast.

280
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,040
What did he say?

281
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,870
He just said... "Understood."

282
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:55,020
And then I heard the rumbling
of the King Engine.

283
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,830
To finish this, I need to bring
him over here and make sure

284
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,330
our attack doesn't cause
any casualties in the city.

285
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,200
Those are the rules.

286
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,440
Saitama?

287
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,860
Saitama!

288
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,150
Is that you, Genos?

289
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,860
I figured you'd be here.

290
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,130
It's a good thing we came.

291
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,320
Huh? Saitama, you look refreshed...

292
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,700
I feel like I was able
to blow off some steam.

293
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:13,730
I kept losing to you at video games,
so I was pretty stressed out.

294
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,170
You were still annoyed about that?

295
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,530
Master Saitama!

296
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,050
There's something I'd like to ask you.

297
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:21,880
What's up?

298
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,970
What do you think I'm lacking?

299
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,930
Huh? Probably power?

300
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,150
Thank you very much!

301
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,060
No... Don't use Saitama as an example...

302
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,020
Genos!

303
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:43,610
Your battles show me the way, Master.

304
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:47,700
He has shown me true strength and
the destination I should strive for.

305
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,520
I will also head there.

306
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:58,460
Let's go home.

307
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:35,770
Garo? Looks like he passed out.

308
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:37,770
Get plenty of rest.

309
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,330
We'll reach Orochi soon.
