1
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,610
I'll plunge this world into darkness!

2
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,530
That's as far as you go, Devil Count!

3
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,660
Ugh... This lame theme song... It's Justice Man!

4
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,420
That hero's getting in the
way at the good part again!

5
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,700
You can do it! I believe in you, Devil Earl!

6
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,420
Kick Justice Man's butt!

7
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,030
Justice Punch!

8
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,120
Dang it! He lost again!

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,940
When will there be a monster
that can defeat Justice Man?

10
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:46,750
Huh?

11
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,130
Heroes don't lose to anyone?

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,860
But why?

13
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,070
Justice always prevails?

14
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,150
But that's not fair!

15
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,640
Monsters have ambitions, too!

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,740
Monsters are working hard, too...

17
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:05,020
And yet, they always just die in the end...

18
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,900
But I want to support them...
What about my feelings?

19
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,790
Monsters are so much cooler...

20
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:17,050
That the popular guys win and the
unpopular guys lose is a tragedy.

21
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,990
In that case... I won't lose to anyone.

22
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,500
I'll become the ultimate monster.

23
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,240
Sell

24
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,240
We'll buy your brand-name items

25
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,240
We pay top prices

26
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,970
What am I doing here?

27
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,620
I don't really remember
what happened last night.

28
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:23,180
Regarding Director Zeimeet's
assault by a thug last night...

29
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,760
We're certain that Garo the
hero hunter was behind it.

30
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,650
So that means he's not
only going after heroes.

31
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,270
He's going after the Association itself.

32
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,600
He's strong enough to
defeat Tank-Top Master.

33
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,480
Regular guards won't be enough.

34
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,440
Metal Bat

35
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,630
Let's issue an alert.

36
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,570
Executives should avoid going
outside unnecessarily

37
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:48,290
and, if they must go anywhere,
have Class S heroes accompany them.

38
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,720
Are you sure?

39
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,880
The Class S heroes have been rather
busy dealing with monsters lately.

40
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:59,460
But the safety of executives close
to our sponsors is more important.

41
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,300
Bodyguard for an executive?

42
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,260
I decline. Why?

43
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:09,220
Because I'm in the middle
of a battle right now.

44
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:15,440
I just defeated them, but I'm now heading
to the stage with the secret boss.

45
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,860
Mouse Sushi

46
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,180
Call someone else.

47
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:25,530
Thanks for being my bodyguard
today, Metal Bat.

48
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,030
Class S Rank 15
Metal Bat

49
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,990
I came here because I was told that
there was an important mission...

50
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,710
Apparently executives from the Hero
Association are also being targeted right now,

51
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:37,600
but my son insisted on trying
some commoner food today.

52
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,630
Wow, look, Papa!

53
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,630
Pudding Pudding

54
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,610
There's even pudding on this thing!

55
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:47,230
I was wondering how vile sushi
must be if it's under 10,000 yen,

56
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,800
but it seems this can actually be quite fun.

57
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,740
The hell is this? Literally hell?

58
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,640
Hey! Don't put back a plate you ate from!

59
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,000
Why?

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,330
They need it when they tally up your total.

61
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,360
But returning the plates
is proper etiquette.

62
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,270
I just told you not to return the plates!

63
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,170
The color of this urchin is awful.

64
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,040
Don't they have any caviar?

65
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,790
What's medium fatty tuna?

66
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,750
Fatty Tuna    Medium Fatty Tuna

67
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,320
You can actually eat part
of a tuna that's not fatty tuna?

68
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,920
Stop putting it back!

69
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,050
Next time they try to put
a plate back, I'll kill them!

70
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,510
Gah!

71
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,840
Did you get a phone call?

72
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,280
It's my little sister!

73
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,720
I need to step out. Stay right here!

74
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,220
Lavatory

75
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,690
Women

76
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,690
Men

77
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,690
I can't help it! I suddenly got
a really important mission.

78
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,760
I promise I'll take you
shopping some other time.

79
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,060
Huh? Where am I right now?

80
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,370
Mouse Sushi.

81
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,500
You've got it all wrong!

82
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,320
This is seriously a mission!

83
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,110
Hey, come on. Don't cry.

84
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,030
I'll explain everything later.

85
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,890
I-I'm hanging up now. Later.

86
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,210
I'm the one who wants to cry.

87
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,210
I'm never taking requests
from executives ever again.

88
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,570
Shit! Is that Garo?

89
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,420
Papa!

90
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,780
Apparently not.

91
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,930
Save him! That monster's got my son!

92
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,010
He's definitely an executive
from the Hero Association.

93
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,060
How nice of him to bring
his kid. Let's take him.

94
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,580
Hang on, damn it.

95
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,890
I'm not letting you set
foot outside this place.

96
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,070
You haven't paid yet.

97
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,750
Charanko said he entered on a whim.

98
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:41,130
Entrants    Reception    Entrance

99
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,130
What a moron. But...

100
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,250
I wouldn't be surprised if someone
strong was actually here.

101
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:50,720
Reception

102
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,020
May I have your name, sir?

103
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,720
Uh... Charanko.

104
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,430
Please write down your fighting style.

105
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,010
Fighting style?

106
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,690
I think it was, uh...

107
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,870
Charanko
(Fist of Water Polo, Carbonation)
Green Room

108
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,910
So this is the lineup for this tournament...

109
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,530
Zakkos  Charanko  Bakuzan

110
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,530
It's seeded. I wonder if this
Bakuzan guy is strong, then.

111
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:13,700
Or if we go the other way,
I guess this Suiryu guy is the seed.

112
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,700
Suiryu  Max  Ring-Ring  Benpats  Snek

113
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,910
Hey, you're Charanko, right?

114
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,790
Shit. Does he actually know Charanko?

115
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:24,340
Hey, come on, now.
Did you forget the face of your senpai?

116
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,960
Is "Fist of Water Polo, Carbonation"
supposed to be some kind of joke?

117
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,720
Well, I can't blame you for panicking.

118
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,200
You never did like me.

119
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,350
Hero Association Hospital

120
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:42,310
He better not have entered the
tournament in my place...

121
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,350
I guess he's not that stupid.

122
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,180
No, wait. Saitama does seem pretty stupid.

123
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,150
Saitama?

124
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,990
Oh, you're...

125
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:56,200
You know Saitama?

126
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,410
Charanko, do you know why
I entered this tournament?

127
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:05,130
I couldn't care less, to be honest.
Could you please just go away?

128
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,040
There are two reasons.

129
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,630
First, because this Super Fight tournament

130
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,960
is one of the best ways for a fighter
to make a name for themselves.

131
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:17,240
Winner

132
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,050
Master Bang won a while back.

133
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,090
And the second reason...

134
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,350
The incident that happened
at last year's tournament.

135
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,650
The winner was a masked
fighter named Wolfman.

136
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:30,370
But later on, they found the
actual Wolfman unconscious.

137
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,620
And that's why they banned entering under
false names and the use of disguises.

138
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,120
D-Disguises?

139
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,120
You putting down a false fighting
style might also be in the gray area.

140
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,380
What happens if they find out?

141
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,090
You're stripped your qualifications
and permanently banned.

142
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,170
And considering last year's incident,

143
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,090
you'll probably also be sued
and slapped with a huge fine.

144
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,550
You might even be arrested.

145
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,000
Huh? What?!

146
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,390
Huh? What's up?

147
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:04,010
Don't tell me you...

148
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:08,020
have an idea who that
despicable impostor was!

149
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,430
I'm safe.

150
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,070
After seeing the video of them fighting,
I'm certain I know who it is.

151
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,630
There's no doubt about it.

152
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,780
The impostor in the last tournament

153
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,740
was Garo!

154
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,370
Heya. I'm back again.

155
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,960
Oh, hey, old dude!
Are you out patrolling again?

156
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:29,040
Stop calling me "old dude."
And let me borrow that book.

157
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,750
I told you, you can't borrow it.

158
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,860
Huh?

159
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,420
I'm saying... that we
should read it together.

160
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,230
Garo, huh?

161
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,270
That name came up again.

162
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,210
About six months ago.

163
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,360
So it's right after the incident
where he was expelled by our master.

164
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,480
There's no doubt about it.

165
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,060
That incident?

166
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,290
You were off slacking somewhere,
so I'm sure you didn't know,

167
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,030
but it happened while the master was gone.

168
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,520
I'm tired of this.

169
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,240
Huh?

170
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,910
There's nothing else I can learn here.

171
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,940
Let's have an actual fight.

172
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,010
He was hiding his true intent
while sharpening his fangs.

173
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:21,140
If he hadn't shown up, we wouldn't
have had to leave the dojo, damn it!

174
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,560
That's why I'm going to win
this tournament today

175
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,060
and regain my confidence.

176
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,940
Confidence that I can get to Garo's level.

177
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,980
But to think that you'd have the
guts to enter the Super Fight when

178
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,040
you were one of the weakest at the dojo...

179
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,700
You sure got cocky.

180
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,080
I hear you're calling yourself
Master Bang's top student,

181
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,040
but don't get too full of yourself.

182
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:52,220
I see. So Saitama might enter
the tournament in your place.

183
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,670
Yeah.

184
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,660
If someone inexperienced ends up
entering a tournament like that...

185
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,320
They'll definitely be killed.

186
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,480
You don't need to worry.

187
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,640
After all, he's...

188
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,600
a hero.

189
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:08,890
You know, I wouldn't have
left the dojo if I'd known

190
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,030
that Garo was going to be expelled.

191
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,400
But if I hadn't quit,

192
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,910
I, Sourface, would've been Master
Bang's number one student right now.

193
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:21,950
How about it? Why don't we practice
some holds until you pass out again?

194
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,410
But you did quit the dojo, right?

195
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,540
What?

196
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,620
Charanko fought Garo one-on-one.

197
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,080
But anyway, I plan on defeating Garo myself.

198
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:37,050
As long as he's hunting heroes, I'm sure
I'll run into him sooner or later.

199
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,540
What I'm saying is that

200
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,950
you ran away, so you don't get to
act like you're better than me.

201
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,680
You'd better be prepared
to defend those words!

202
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,760
The Super Fight is a one-day tournament.

203
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,690
If you can actually manage
to win your way to the top,

204
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,750
we're going to bump heads in the ring.

205
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,610
And that's when I'll show you

206
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,240
what a real battle is.

207
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,290
A real battle, huh?

208
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,500
I don't remember what
that feels like at all.

209
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,630
That was amazing, Papa!

210
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,630
He defeated them in no time!

211
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,720
All right, let's take a
picture to remember this.

212
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,430
Hey, hurry up and take cover. It's dangerous.

213
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,440
Venus-People Trap and I were
both annihilated instantly.

214
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,900
Considering what you did to us,
I guess you really are strong,

215
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,660
Metal Bat.

216
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,570
So that's what a Class S hero is like, huh?

217
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:47,790
But if you're that strong,
you probably think you're the strongest.

218
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,480
I was the same way...

219
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,210
Man, bugs are persistent.

220
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,420
I should probably finish you off.

221
00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:00,840
But then, my senpai showed up...

222
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,930
Another one?!

223
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:17,170
Kohai, I'll avenge you.

224
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,400
Monster
Centisenpai

225
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,530
It's so creepy!

226
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,570
That thing's twice the
size of the other one!

227
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,900
What's that smell?

228
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,130
Monster
Lafreshidon

229
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,630
So the hero hunter Garo has
nothing to do with this?

230
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,350
Well, thinking about that's
not gonna help right now.

231
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,420
I'm just going to crush you!

232
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,750
Yup! He'll get back up and face
the enemy, no matter what!

233
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,980
So you don't have to worry about Saitama!

234
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,330
U-Uh, I—

235
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:08,330
Besides, he would never break
the rules to enter in your place.

236
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,590
He's a hero, after all!

237
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,820
R-Right...

238
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,040
That's good, I guess...

239
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,630
Yeah!

240
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,210
Tennis Player Ryu

241
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:21,710
Man...

242
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,340
I'm bored.

243
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,050
This is Watchdog Man.

244
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,510
Complete Edition

245
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,510
Hero Guide

246
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,510
Isn't he cute?

247
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,970
He just looks like some
guy in a dog costume.

248
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,180
Is he actually strong?

249
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,890
Of course he is! He's a Class S hero!

250
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,600
Class S Rank 12, huh?

251
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,090
He usually sits atop his
own special lookout.

252
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,530
Super Huge Lottery

253
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,770
You can meet him there at any time!

254
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,010
Oh?

255
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:54,200
Urgent evacuation order.
Urgent evacuation order.

256
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,960
Monsters have appeared in the
shopping district of City S.

257
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,460
Threat level: Demon.

258
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,420
Currently, Class S hero
Metal Bat is on the scene.

259
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:08,880
Everyone outside should
immediately seek shelter indoors.

260
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,670
Old dude...

261
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,420
Well, you heard her.

262
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,000
Hurry up and run home.

263
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,890
Okay!

264
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,620
I repeat.

265
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,100
Urgent evacuation order.
Urgent evacuation order.

266
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,740
Centipede Parade!

267
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,380
Not bad.

268
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,880
No wonder he gave our kohai trouble.

269
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,340
What the hell do you guys want?

270
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,550
Why are you after them?

271
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,020
We'll tell you if you can defeat us.

272
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:07,320
Looks like my sleep smell is finally kicking in.

273
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,650
Perfect!

274
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:16,910
I'm losing consciousness...

275
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,200
Now, goodnight!

276
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,750
Take that, and that, and that!

277
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,680
He just... hit himself in the head?

278
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,980
Did you finally lose your mind?!

279
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,190
Man, I feel so much better.

280
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,240
He's even more powerful than before!

281
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,910
But my sleep smell shouldn't
wear off that easily...

282
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,710
What in the world happened?!

283
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:05,320
If I can pump myself up, I can
pretty much handle anything.

284
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,960
You guys beat me pretty damn hard earlier.

285
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:14,340
But you see, I'm a pretty nice guy...

286
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,490
So I'll wipe you both out

287
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,890
with a single blow!

288
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,440
I haven't been that pumped in a while.

289
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,380
I forgot to ask the monsters
what their motive was!

290
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,140
It totally slipped my mind.

291
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,910
Looks like they're unharmed.

292
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:48,920
Hey, wake up, you jerks.
Or should I smack you awake?

293
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,290
We came to back you up!

294
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,700
We'll fight, too!

295
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,800
Class C Hero
Mohican

296
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,800
Class B Hero
Pineapple

297
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,130
Oh, I just finished up.

298
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:57,760
Huh?

299
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,260
What?!

300
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:03,320
Well, Metal Bat never ceases to amaze me.

301
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,230
Now that family should be...

302
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,760
What's the matter?

303
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,660
The fact that Centikohai and Centisenpai
appeared one after another

304
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,930
probably means...

305
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,110
Hey, you don't mean...

306
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,760
You remember the incident from
two years ago, don't you?

307
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,040
If that thing appears again...

308
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,910
Yeah. It won't be a matter
of bodyguards anymore.

309
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,410
The city will be destroyed.

310
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,710
Th-That's...

311
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,900
The great monster, Centichoro!

312
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:40,220
It's threat level is... Dragon!

313
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,470
Dragon, eh?

314
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:45,710
I'll go call for Class S backup.
Let's get out of here for now.

315
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,930
That thing's after that family there.

316
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,850
You guys take them while
I deal with this guy.

317
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,190
As fast as you can!

318
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,400
Hurry!

319
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,860
Now, then... What to do?

320
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,320
Is that thing staring at us?

321
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,040
You won't get away.

322
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,410
It's charging!

323
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,710
Don't turn around! Just keep running!

324
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,220
It's so hard!

325
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,260
Out of my way!

326
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,620
My full swing didn't even
make a crack in that thing.

327
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,190
But...

328
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,280
That bastard made sure I didn't
hit its face with the bat.

329
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,900
So that's exactly where I'm gonna aim!

330
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,830
It's coming after us!

331
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,630
No, wait. Look above it!

332
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,190
That's—

333
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,340
Killer Move...

334
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,840
Pumped-Up...

335
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,780
Dragon Pummelin'!

336
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:03,800
Dragon Pummelin'

337
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,190
Centipede Undulation!

338
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,060
Centipede Undulation

339
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,250
This is what a Dragon-level monster is like?

340
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,780
Humanity shouldn't have to
face something like that!

341
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,590
Urgent evacuation order.

342
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:33,540
Another Dragon-level monster
has appeared in City S.

343
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,120
Did the heroes lose?!

344
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,300
This world is finished!

345
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,760
Run! Hurry!

346
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,720
Wow, things sure got lively.

347
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,760
I guess that would happen when
a Dragon-level monster appears.

348
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:52,850
Now, I wonder if I'll find Metal Bat alive...

349
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,230
Metal Bat?

350
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,970
How?

351
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:03,090
Oh, I see.

352
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:07,110
To think that a Class S hero was done
in by any other monster but me...

353
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,300
Damn. I wasted my time.

354
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,950
Man... I need to hurry up and get back.

355
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,920
H-Hey, wait a sec, Metal Bat!

356
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,540
If you're alive, that's a different story!

357
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,760
Sweet. My second Class S hero!

358
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:26,190
Now you have to fight me.
I'm gonna hunt you!

359
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,220
Huh? What the hell are you
talking about, you moron?

360
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,500
Don't you see that giant centipede?

361
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,640
Hurry up and evac—

362
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,020
I see.

363
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,030
So you're the human calling yourself
the hero-hunting monster...

364
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,990
That's right. I'm Garo.

365
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,340
I'm busy, damn it.

366
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:54,420
If you're picking a fight with me,
I'm gonna bash your crazy head in.

367
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:29,760
What? There's a Dragon-level monster in City S!

368
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,260
Emergency Evacuation Order

369
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,260
Dragon

370
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,260
City S

371
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,260
You're right. That sounds bad.

372
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,510
You girls are going to watch
the Super Fight, right?

373
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,620
Take me with you.

374
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,770
I haven't been there in ages,
so I don't remember the way.

375
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,340
Y-You're...

376
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,270
Aren't you...

377
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,580
You don't mind, right?

378
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:50,250
