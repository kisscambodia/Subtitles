1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,740
The Hero Association has
been weakened substantially,

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:10,310
and we still have our main forces in reserve.

3
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:14,270
Victory is certain for the
Monster Association,

4
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,580
Monster King Orochi.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,380
Now, then...

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,370
Let's see what the Hero Association
will do with their inferior numbers.

7
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:03,260
Charanko... I'll show you
what true martial arts is.

8
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:03,890
Come at me!

9
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,560
Charanko took him out with one punch!

10
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,820
We now have our top four!

11
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,900
Who will come out on top?!

12
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,030
Class S Heroes

13
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,030
This thing's starting to make my head itchy...

14
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,620
Hey, you're up!

15
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,020
What's wrong? Why are you
holding your head like that?

16
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,620
You nervous?

17
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,460
Uh... Yeah...

18
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,300
If I hadn't let my guard down
during my fight with you,

19
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,210
I'd probably be holding my
head out of nervousness, too.

20
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,210
That last semi-final match was amazing!

21
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,180
Suiryu took the guy down
with one kick again.

22
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,930
But the guy you're up against
is also pretty nasty.

23
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:47,180
I think he's the real dark
horse of this tournament.

24
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,650
Be careful out there, Charanko!

25
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,530
He's starting to sound like
a decent senior disciple...

26
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,650
But I'm not Charanko.

27
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,800
Watchdog Man.

28
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,610
Watchdog Man
Class S Rank 12

29
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,490
Here I go.

30
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,200
We're gonna fight one-on-one!

31
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,660
There's more trouble!

32
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,550
A horde of monsters showed
up at Watchdog Plaza!

33
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,460
What?!

34
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,960
Numerous monsters have
appeared in the suburbs, too!

35
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,050
It's a party!

36
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,680
Stop that! Release them!

37
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,890
I, Dogman, will face you!

38
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,140
You call that poison?

39
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,730
You're not even alive, are you?

40
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,570
Guess you got me. In that case...

41
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,900
Gonna self-destruct now!

42
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,410
The one controlling
you is somewhere else!

43
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,400
Do we have an antidote for
the poison in City Y yet?!

44
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,000
Not that I know of.

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,430
Damn it.

46
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,080
It'll be all right.

47
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,460
They're on the move.

48
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,810
Class S Rank 9 Drive Knight

49
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,810
There are countless monsters appearing,
but the Hero Association lacks information.

50
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,190
Choose.

51
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:22,250
You can die as my tactical transformations
inflict all manner of pain upon you,

52
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,250
or you can tell me everything
you know and die painlessly.

53
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,620
How dare you disrupt my concert?

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You can atone with your deaths.

55
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,840
Found you.

56
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,170
Class S Rank 5 Child Emperor

57
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,420
You were the one controlling
that robot, weren't you?

58
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,840
I've finished analyzing the poison. But...

59
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,430
If only I had my backpack...

60
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,690
Class S Rank 10
Pig God

61
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,820
Mr. Pig God!

62
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,120
I heard explosions, so I came to help.

63
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,820
You're in my way!

64
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,490
Die!

65
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,950
Oh, no! Her poison!

66
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,240
Don't worry! I'll save you!

67
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,920
Hork Hork Hork Hork Hork

68
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,670
Mr. Pig God! The poison!

69
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,010
Don't worry. I'm fine.

70
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,020
Burp.

71
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,100
We've received antidote data
from the Child Emperor!

72
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,480
Good. Now we can treat those
affected by the poison.

73
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,190
The Class S heroes never cease to amaze me.

74
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,740
And now for round two of the semi-finals!

75
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,860
Semi-finals
Round 2

76
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,860
Try not to blink during this match!

77
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,580
We have Choze, who's been enjoying the
physical destruction of his opponents

78
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,610
more than he really should,

79
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,660
and Charanko, who's settled every
battle with one punch so far!

80
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,460
Taking out your opponent
with one punch is simple.

81
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,840
But I prefer taking my
time and executing them,

82
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,670
to make them realize I'm
on a different level.

83
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:09,280
My family has spent generations breeding
superior genes. We are a chosen breed.

84
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,100
And I am their finest creation to date.

85
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:16,750
I am a completely different
species from you commoners.

86
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,940
I will show you how powerful
I am in this fight,

87
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,480
and then I shall take over the world!

88
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,910
Jeez, you're dramatic.

89
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,490
So you're basically like a new kind of corn.

90
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,910
You're gonna die.

91
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:35,650
I can't wait to see you cry
and scream your lungs out!

92
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,500
Begin!

93
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:41,160
H-He took him out with one punch yet again!

94
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,110
Charanko is heading to the finals
without a single scratch!

95
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,460
Guess the tournament's over already.

96
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,430
Charanko is just full of surprises!

97
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,010
We've lost contact with the
Class A heroes in City I!

98
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,520
Got it. Send a Class S—

99
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,550
Hang on!

100
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,400
I hid among the rubble

101
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,650
until more of us showed up.

102
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,610
Now that we have this
many Class A heroes here,

103
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,750
you can leave this to us!

104
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,530
Don't even bother.

105
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:21,460
Mediocre fighters like yourselves
would just cause further damage.

106
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,000
Class S Rank 13
Flashy Flash

107
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,630
Mediocre?

108
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,460
Just keep quiet and watch!

109
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,190
This is a Class S hero?

110
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,180
Didn't you just cause even more damage?

111
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,040
Did it work?

112
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,800
I just hit it in its open wounds!

113
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,260
Take this! My special technique...

114
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:28,440
That's...

115
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,900
Terrible Tornado!

116
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,030
Hey!

117
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:55,180
We're short on heroes, so why the heck
are all of you here fooling around?

118
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,930
We were fighting that octo—

119
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,450
Especially you! Flashy Flash, was it?

120
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,220
You need to do better than that
if you're actually a Class S!

121
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,420
Ugh, you're all so useless.

122
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,910
How dare you say that after stealing
someone's quarry, you fool?

123
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,040
Do you think you're stronger than me?

124
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,240
What if she hears you?!

125
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,120
Don't drag us into your squabbles!

126
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,080
That was unnecessary.

127
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,730
I couldn't do a damn thing!

128
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,820
It appears that Class S heroes
are truly troublesome.

129
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,210
They're not a problem.

130
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,070
We can create as many monsters as we want.

131
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,680
Kenkaizan

132
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,680
I'm sure you can guess why
I've gathered you here today.

133
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,350
It's in regards to the hero hunter, Garo.

134
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:53,990
Silverfang is currently
pursuing Garo. However...

135
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,200
Silverfang may lose to Garo.

136
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,640
Of course, no one doubts his skills.

137
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,140
But Garo is his former student.

138
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,170
He may become soft.

139
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,580
And that's why we,
the Holy Order of the Sword,

140
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,040
should find Garo first and cut him down.

141
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,580
But we'll need more men to track him down.

142
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,620
I'm asking for your help... Your strength
as the most powerful swordsmen.

143
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,550
This must be urgent,
for you to go to such lengths.

144
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,950
Very well. I'll mobilize my students.

145
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,020
Amahare.

146
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,820
Relying on us is the right move.

147
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,850
Zanbai.

148
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,270
We're worth a thousand men.

149
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,370
Nichirin.

150
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,440
Thank you. I promise I'll repay you—

151
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:43,320
Since when did the members of the Holy
Order of the Sword become best friends?

152
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,410
Haragiri.

153
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:50,620
Our only purpose should be to devote our
lives to mastering the art of the sword.

154
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,900
That's enough. You're drunk.
You shouldn't—

155
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,150
Hang on a second.
I've got something to discuss, as well.

156
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,920
Something extra special...

157
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,720
Monster cells.

158
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,720
Taking one into your body
gives you super-human strength.

159
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,690
Essentially, it makes you a monster.

160
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,230
You've lost your mind.

161
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,360
Where did you get these?

162
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,670
There's a group called the Monster
Association that's made up of monsters.

163
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,490
They happened to reach out to me.

164
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:27,120
I joined them, forfeiting my humanity,
so I could become even stronger.

165
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,620
Did you actually...

166
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,900
That's right!

167
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:35,090
I'm no longer human!
And I've obtained unbelievable power!

168
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,860
And now you shall become monsters, too!

169
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,260
You're a failure, Haragiri.

170
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:46,740
I have the skill to lop off all of
your heads with a single swing!

171
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,600
Anyone who refuses will die!

172
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,520
How sad.

173
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:58,440
Indeed, it is for you, Atomic Samurai.
I've been ordered to kill you either way.

174
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,990
I'll wait three seconds!
Now, eat the monster cells!

175
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,950
Three, two, one!

176
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,370
We're not as dumb as you.

177
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:22,760
Let's go.

178
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,170
First, we have to crush
the Monster Association.

179
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:32,500
And now, the finals of the
Super Fight are finally upon us!

180
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,320
Charanko should definitely
be at a disadvantage here,

181
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,700
but... could it be?

182
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,440
It might just happen, folks!

183
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:48,120
It sounds like the crowd's
hoping for a huge upset!

184
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,290
But this man's not going to let that happen!

185
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,040
I can't even picture him having
a hard time in a match.

186
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,250
It's Suiryu of the Dark Corporeal Fist

187
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,200
versus Charanko of the Fist of Water Polo!

188
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,960
Did this guy figure out I'm wearing a wig?

189
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,420
Who will be our victor?!

190
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,690
Look at that smile on Suiryu's face!

191
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,760
Does he still have the upper hand?

192
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,880
Maybe it's because he's trying to hide

193
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,110
the fact that he's nervous, but Charanko
sure has an idiotic expression right now.

194
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,730
This is just how I always look...

195
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,020
Take your stances!

196
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,020
Let's have fun, Charanko.

197
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,010
Huh?

198
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:21,900
Begin!

199
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,950
It finally begins!

200
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:25,740
Crap.

201
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,360
Suiryu strikes first!

202
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,830
But for some reason, he stopped his attack!

203
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,540
H-His moves are too fast!

204
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,790
I thought I'd feel things out
since this is the final...

205
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,340
But the breeze from his kicks is dangerous!

206
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,170
Is he doing that on purpose?

207
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,390
What's wrong? It's not like
you can't see my moves!

208
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:53,500
Multiple kicks! But he's
aborting all of them!

209
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,010
All Charanko's able to do is guard his head!

210
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,170
Has he already lost his will to fight?!

211
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:03,320
The announcer's got no clue.
That was just a warm-up.

212
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:07,900
You're strong, right?
I can tell because I'm strong, too.

213
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,530
I guess he wasn't trying to kick off my wig.

214
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:15,030
Your eyes... They're not
after fame or prestige.

215
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,660
You're looking for fun!

216
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,000
Yeah, could be.

217
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,130
Why did you enter this tournament?

218
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,710
I'm after the prize money, by the way.

219
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,420
I want that, too.

220
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,010
There is one other reason.

221
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:33,460
I thought it'd be nice if I could
fight a decent opponent, too.

222
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,860
Of course, I'm going to win in the end,

223
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,600
but getting there is the fun part.

224
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,520
Fun, huh?

225
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,400
Yeah! It's fun being strong.

226
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,270
I see.

227
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:49,160
I came here so that I could
experience martial arts.

228
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,210
I heard everyone here was tough,

229
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:54,140
but the matches ended so quickly
if I fought back even a little.

230
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,600
What are they talking about?

231
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,500
They must be talking about all the hardships
they endured to get to the finals.

232
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,910
At this rate, I thought it might've
been pointless for me to even come...

233
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,840
But you might actually be different.

234
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,670
Got it.

235
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,200
Then how about this?

236
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,660
I'll help you experience martial arts,

237
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,560
so in return, do your best to entertain me.

238
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,520
Hey, good idea.

239
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,020
All right, then...

240
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,180
Let's begin.

241
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,150
Here I come!

242
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,030
H-He's even faster now!

243
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,480
Did Suiryu finally get serious?!

244
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,030
It's just gonna keep coming!

245
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,660
He kicked him into the air!

246
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,460
Safe.

247
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,760
Th-That finishes it!

248
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,340
Is Charanko okay?!

249
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,600
Can he stand?

250
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,460
Ch-Charanko!

251
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,890
Their difference in ability
was just too great!

252
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,230
Did I end it already?

253
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,980
You scared me for a second.

254
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,380
I really thought my wig was
going to fly off this time.

255
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:10,610
Good.

256
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,990
Otherwise, it'd be no fun!

257
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,490
He's holding out!

258
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,300
If he keeps it up, he might
be able to turn the tables!

259
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:23,290
No. Look at Suiryu.
He's only been using kicks so far.

260
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,170
He's holding back so that
he can play around more.

261
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,500
You mean...

262
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,420
He's not even serious yet.

263
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,940
Your specialty is your punch, right?

264
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,130
Come on! Hit me!

265
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,010
Entertain me some more!

266
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,490
Did he figure out I was
going to counter him?

267
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,520
He's a white belt, but he
definitely has some experience.

268
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,980
He's pretty slick for always
guarding his head, too.

269
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,110
What do you normally do?

270
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,550
Normally?

271
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,370
Uh, go for walks and defeat monsters?

272
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,410
What? You fight monsters?

273
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,370
You almost sound like a hero.

274
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:07,450
W-Well, I thought it might be
cool to be a hero in the future.

275
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:11,460
Jeez... Even you aspire to be a hero?

276
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,220
I don't think that hero
business is all that great.

277
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:21,410
I fought some Class A heroes earlier,
and they were so weak, it was a joke.

278
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,860
"Hero" is just some stupid title.

279
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,600
It's supposed to be their profession,

280
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,030
but they won't shut up about
good deeds and justice.

281
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:34,240
People at that level are never going
to be able to save the world, though.

282
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:40,990
Noble aspirations, fine thoughts,
lofty ethics, heroic justice...

283
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,870
They're just boring contaminants
in my life of seeking fun.

284
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:51,390
You're strong, too. So you shouldn't be
so concerned about such trivial things.

285
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,960
Just live free and have fun.

286
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,050
Oh, did I bum you out?

287
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,850
I'm only giving you some truthful
advice because I respect you.

288
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,110
That's a clean hit!

289
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,640
Huh?

290
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,910
Contaminant?

291
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,170
Who the hell cares about that?

292
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,860
You're not the only one doing what you want.

293
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,650
Suiryu, was it?

294
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,840
Let me give you some advice, as well.

295
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:21,910
If you just want to have fun,
you probably shouldn't get any stronger.

296
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:32,790
Crap! I keep forgetting!
I almost cut the fight short again.

297
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,820
Wh-What in the world was that?!

298
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,900
Did you see that?!

299
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,490
I've never seen anything like that!

300
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:42,970
B-But a shocking truth about
Charanko has just been revealed!

301
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:47,180
It's been discovered that
he's been wearing a wig!

302
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:51,660
The referees are making their move!
Could this mean...

303
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,760
Allow me to explain.

304
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,910
After last year's incident where
someone impersonated Wolfman,

305
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:00,860
the rules of this year's
tournament changed,

306
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:04,710
meaning wearing masks or anything
on your head is against the rules.

307
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,790
This includes wigs.

308
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:10,260
Therefore, Charanko is disqualified!

309
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,730
U-Unbelievable! That ends our match!

310
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,260
The winner is Suiryu!

311
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,610
Seriously?

312
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,760
Continue the fight!

313
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:23,210
Charanko... You're so young,
but you were dealing with such hardship?

314
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,850
No, someone was just impersonating him.

315
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:27,100
Saitama! What's he doing here?

316
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,930
You know him?

317
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:32,170
We'll be verifying if you're actually
who you say you are later.

318
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:32,970
That's my cue to leave.

319
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,900
Playtime's over.

320
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,940
This is where things get real.

321
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:46,390
I didn't get to show you my true skills yet!

322
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,500
The platform!

323
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,460
You're not getting away!

324
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:06,050
U-U-Unbelievable! They're still
continuing the match!

325
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,720
I thought you were all about having fun.

326
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,640
Well, losing isn't fun!

327
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,890
That's it!

328
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,380
Fight more!

329
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,150
Finish this!

330
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,900
Things are heating up!

331
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,860
Suiryu's overcome with emotion!

332
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,600
I've never seen him look like that!

333
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,600
Listen up! This is what
true martial arts is like!

334
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:31,750
Dark Body Flying Dragon Fist!

335
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,780
He hits him again, and again, and yet again!

336
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,490
He's not going to stop!

337
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,670
He's... totally unfazed.

338
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,180
The platform's falling apart!

339
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,190
That's some excessive footwork.

340
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,100
He's going in for the kill!

341
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,220
Run!

342
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,940
Even that isn't...

343
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,650
I see. I'm starting to get it.

344
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:03,660
Do you finally understand
something about martial arts?

345
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,820
So basically, martial arts is...

346
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:09,240
a way to move around all cool-like?

347
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,460
H-How superficial!

348
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,710
That's all he got from all my attacks?!

349
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,780
Guess I'll give it a shot, too.

350
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:23,630
It'd be pretty cool if I could defeat a
monster by doing some spinny move.

351
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,260
Take this seriously!

352
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,920
And he lands a hip attack!

353
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,870
Whoops... My obi...

354
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,650
Man, how lame...

355
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,150
Now's our chance! Grab him!

356
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:40,610
Shit!

357
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,950
He's making a run for it!
Hold it right there!

358
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,410
He's heading for the green rooms! After him!

359
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,020
I... lost...

360
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,590
For the first time...

361
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,590
I was defeated!

362
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,370
That was unprecedented...

363
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:37,470
That monster was definitely
stronger than other monsters!

364
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:45,060
Goketsu
Threat Level: Dragon

365
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:50,250
The Strong Ones Fight Back
