Meng,

32
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,480
what is this style?

33
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,320
Hip-hop?

34
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,680
You know nothing.

35
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,360
Take the hairpin back.

36
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,320
What?

37
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,200
You think it’s ugly?

38
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,120
No,

39
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,280
but it doesn’t suit me.

40
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,080
You found your own style?

41
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,480
Whatever.

42
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,680
What I used before was too troublesome.

43
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,960
From now on,

44
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,600
I’ll be me.

45
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,040
I’ll dress myself however I like.

(Result of Nanfeng No. 1 High School Physics Contest)
Jiang Haoyue has won three rounds.

47
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,040
When can we go on the autumn trip?

48
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,840
Qu Wei still comes second.

49
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,480
Why do you keep
talking about Qu Wei lately?

50
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,600
Are you going to confess to him?

51
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,160
Speaking of confession,

52
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,360
your eye-contact...

53
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:17,880
All right,

54
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,320
I’ll shut up.

55
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,880
Shut up.

56
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,080
Something’s up.

57
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,200
Quickly,

58
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,960
the dishes are getting cold.

59
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,000
Mom, come on.

60
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,400
It seems to be Jiang’s birthday

61
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,640
two days later.

62
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,680
I’m aware.

63
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,520
How do we celebrate?

64
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,480
Have it your way.

65
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,480
Just keep it quiet.

66
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,480
Mr. Jiang doesn’t like too much noise.

67
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,520
Let’s invite him to our house.

68
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,360
I’ll buy him a cake.

69
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,960
Let me choose the cake.

70
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,280
I’m sure he’ll like it.

71
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,760
Cake again?

72
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,360
What’s wrong with a cake?

73
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,280
Cake is for birthday, isn’t it?

74
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,400
What? Soup for birthday celebration?

75
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,360
Get me soup.

76
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,320
Soup on birthday...

77
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,400
He would have a cake on every birthday.

78
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,840
Jiang is about to be 17.

79
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,600
Shouldn’t we give him a present?

80
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,920
I agree.

81
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,000
So...

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,520
A pen?

83
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,120
Let’s buy him a pen

84
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,280
to encourage him to study harder.

85
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,880
It has a positive connotation.

86
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,280
A pen?

87
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,840
How about something else?

88
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,560
A pen seems too ordinary.

89
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,600
Yeah.

90
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,000
What are you doing?

91
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,480
I’m choosing
a birthday present for my brother.

92
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,000
Oh,

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
you know what?

94
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,520
In my Ten Rules of Love,

95
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,880
a birthday is the best chance
to test a relationship.

96
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,640
Why?

97
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,600
The birthday persons easily
get emotional

98
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,080
and reveal their true feelings.

99
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,760
That’s when

100
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,280
their true feelings are tested.

101
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,600
Wait a second.

102
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,240
Jiang Haoyue’s true feelings

103
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,560
have nothing to do with me.

104
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,840
“Cheers to Our Friendship”?
This is useless.

105
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,760
Take this.

106
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,720
No, this is too blunt.

107
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,560
What’s wrong with being blunt?

108
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,600
Don’t shilly-shally.

109
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,960
No, no, no.

110
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,200
Just take this.

111
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,040
You’re a tough girl.

112
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,080
Just get on with it.

113
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,760
Well, Mr. Xie,

114
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,520
what present should I

115
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,560
give to Jiang Haoyue?

116
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,000
Does he have any hobbies?

117
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,800
Study.

118
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,280
Not this.

119
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,480
Study is what we are supposed to do
as students.

120
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,080
Presents to encourage him to study

121
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,680
are way too boring.

122
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,600
Give him a snow globe.

123
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,760
This is worse.

124
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,760
That’s too sissy.

125
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,480
Sissy? Why?

126
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,240
What do you have in mind then?

127
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,620
(Being cool is easy to achieve)

128
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,440
I know.

129
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,120
Jiang Haoyue is sitting
right over there.

130
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,400
We’ll act as planned.

131
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,200
We measure his size in secret.

132
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,600
Can it work?

133
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,040
He’ll notice it.

134
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,040
No worries. Trust me.

135
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,200
Just stay with me later.

136
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,640
Go.

137
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,520
Come on.

138
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,640
Quickly.

139
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,320
Quickly.

140
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,920
Quickly, go.

141
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,160
Hi,

142
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,120
is this seat taken?

143
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,040
No.

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,280
What a coincidence!

145
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,080
You’re self-studying here?

146
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,040
Why are you here?

147
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,800
I’m here to study.

148
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,840
I love to study the most.

149
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,520
What are you studying?

150
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,280
English.

151
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,040
Are you sure it’s not a comic book?

152
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,520
No, I assure it is not.

153
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,280
Trust me.

154
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,840
My English is good.

155
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,560
My English is good. Don’t mind me.

156
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,400
Stay focused on your book.

157
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
Focus, got it?

158
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,800
You must be tired.

159
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,240
How about I give you a massage?

160
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,840
Jiang Haoyue,

161
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,960
the teacher told me that

162
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,160
there will be another exam next week.

163
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,120
Let’s go get the examination papers.

164
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,600
Okay.

165
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,520
Lu Miao,

166
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,240
why are you here?

167
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,040
I’m here to help my bro with his study.

168
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,240
The No. 1 student
in our grade doesn’t need your help.

169
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,840
Xie Ziye.

170
00:08:41,137 --> 00:08:42,017
Hello, senior.

171
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,600
What is this?

172
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,040
Whose tape is it?

173
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,600
Is it not yours?

174
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,080
Not in a million years.

175
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,640
I’ll give it to lost-and-found.

176
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,440
Let’s go. Class is about to begin.

177
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,760
The waistline.

178
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,040
How do I measure that?

179
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,400
Are you okay?

180
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,240
I’m fine.

181
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,560
My legs got numb
because I stood for too long.

182
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,760
Get up first.

183
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,320
Be careful when you walk.

184
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,600
Your pretext is ridiculous.

185
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,600
See you around.

186
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,080
Did you get it?

187
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,800
Probably.

188
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,680
Go.

189
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,360
Everybody,

190
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,600
the date of the autumn
trip has been decided.

191
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,280
No class!

192
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,000
October 13. The day after tomorrow.

193
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,880
No class is the best!

194
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,520
Finally, I get to relax my brain.

195
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,200
What’s wrong with you?

196
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,800
Aren’t you happy about the trip?

197
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,800
The date of the autumn trip

198
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,520
is my brother’s birthday.

199
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,120
What shall I do?

200
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,820
(Mr. Jiang’s birthday)

201
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,160
Are you going on the
autumn trip the day after tomorrow?

202
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,960
No.

203
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,240
I’ll be preparing for the contest
in school.

204
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,920
You can’t be doing exercises forever.

205
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,160
What?

206
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,160
It’s your birthday
the day after tomorrow.

207
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,120
You forget that?

208
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,800
I don’t care about my birthday.

209
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,560
You need to care, though.

210
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,040
You need to properly
celebrate your birthday

211
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,960
so that

212
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,600
in the next year to come,
fortune will favor you

213
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,320
and all the unhappiness will go away.

214
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,280
If only it could be that simple.

215
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,040
Let’s go.

216
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,880
For this autumn trip,

217
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,160
I’ve prepared an alpenstock,

218
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,840
an all-purpose pickaxe

219
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,920
and a tent.

220
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,600
We’re not going into the wild.

221
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,200
It’s just a natural park.

222
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,520
You don’t need these.

223
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,600
Bear Grylls said

224
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,000
nature is beautiful

225
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,160
but also dangerous.

226
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,680
I’ll be honest with you,

227
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,640
I’ve taken professional
survival courses.

228
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,680
Well, in that case,

229
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,000
I’ll bring more snacks.

230
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,840
I’ll bring my edacious mouth.

231
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,680
Meng, what will you bring?

232
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,760
Or how about you join us?

233
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,320
I guarantee you enough food.

234
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,440
I’ll skip it.

235
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,440
Skip class?

236
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,720
Let’s do this together.

237
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,040
I don’t want to attend
the math class in the afternoon anyway.

238
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,000
I’ll skip the autumn trip.

239
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,280
Skip the autumn trip?

240
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,800
Why would she do that?

241
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,840
For Jiang Haoyue.

242
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,320
The date of the autumn trip
is Jiang Haoyue’s birthday.

243
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,400
Him again!?

244
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,560
Again.

245
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,240
Again.

246
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,680
Again.

247
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:36,840
Come on.

248
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,240
Che, I’m Guoguo,

249
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,520
I’m not Jiang Haoyue.

250
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,440
Don’t take it out on me.

251
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,320
She just wants
to celebrate his birthday.

252
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,760
Be the bigger man.

253
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,080
It comes only once in a year.

254
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,880
The autumn trip comes
once in a year as well.

255
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,240
But all she cares about

256
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,840
is Jiang Haoyue.

257
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,680
Even a fool can tell.

258
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,920
I don’t believe it.

259
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,960
My fire will melt her iceberg.

260
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,160
But after the iceberg melts,
it puts out the fire.

261
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,920
All right, I’ll shut up.

262
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,880
What are you going to do next?

263
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,800
I can’t play anymore.

264
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,600
I won’t let Lu Miao...

265
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,880
Skip...

266
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,000
Autumn...

267
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,280
Trip!

268
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,600
Hello?

269
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,600
Okay.

270
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,240
I’ll see you an hour later.

271
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,200
What?

272
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,080
Jiang Haoyue’s birthday cake is coming.

273
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,560
I’ve only gotten one hour.

274
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,520
Hey, everyone,

275
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,200
wake up.

276
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,120
We’ll reach our destination in a bit.

277
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,480
We’ll have a

278
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,200
two-man-three-foot game first.

279
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,920
To be on the safe side,

280
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,080
we’ll choose a girl and a boy

281
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,480
to participate in the game.

282
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,520
The boy will be...

283
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,440
Shi Che.

284
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,400
Okay?

285
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,320
And the girl will be...

286
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,840
Lu Miao.

287
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,760
Lu Miao.

288
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,520
Okay?

289
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,920
So wakey, everybody.

290
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,240
And pack your stuff.

291
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,200
You’re stuck with me.

292
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:41,720
Charge! Charge!

293
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,480
What? Why does it take

294
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,200
you so long to tie your shoes?

295
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,720
Meng,

296
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,640
you know what?

297
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,440
I’ve had this game before.

298
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,880
You’ll easily sprain your ankle.

299
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,080
So you must

300
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,920
tie your shoes firmly

301
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,520
to avoid the injury.

302
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,680
Fussy.

303
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,440
You know what?

304
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,560
This is what a professional
athlete would do.

305
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,040
I’ve asked the PE teachers,

306
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,760
this will be a race
where two people team up as one.

307
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,880
Practice well

308
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,560
before we sign up.

309
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,160
No rush. Safety comes first.

310
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,480
- Okay, Mr. Wen.
- Carry on.

311
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,800
What time is it?

312
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,120
Only half an hour left.

313
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,200
Let’s sign up for the race, quickly.

314
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,840
Come on.

315
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,400
What’s the rush, Meng?

316
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,040
I’m in a rush!

317
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:30,840
All right.

318
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,480
This is about the honor of our class.

319
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,360
We must practice well.

320
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,360
Honor is bigger than my life.

321
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,040
We cannot disappoint our classmates

322
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,160
or Mr. Wen.

323
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,680
Now.

324
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,560
Let’s move.

325
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,520
My bad.

326
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,280
I’m such an idiot.

327
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,240
It’s the ribbon.

328
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,720
The knot isn’t tight enough.

329
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,240
You’re not an idiot.

330
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,520
You just don’t want to knot it well.

331
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,040
How can you say this?

332
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,920
It’s the ribbon’s problem.

333
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,000
It has nothing to do with me.

334
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,360
Che, how about I help you tie the knot?

335
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,400
Do you think it’s my problem?

336
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:06,960
It’s sure...

337
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,120
It is your problem.

338
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,440
You’re stalling.

339
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,840
I’m stalling?

340
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,080
You try it.

341
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,400
Don’t just make comments.

342
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,200
Why would I try it? It’s your race.

343
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,480
I’m doing it for the group,

344
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,200
for the class,

345
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,400
for us all! Okay?

346
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,640
Don’t you think I can
see through your trick?

347
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,120
You didn’t tie the knot well on purpose.

348
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,920
I think you two

349
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,800
can be great teammates,

350
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,120
so how about you two
participate in the race?

351
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,960
I’m off. Goodbye.

352
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,600
Meng, where are you going?

353
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,680
Next, Class 10 and Class 5, Grade 1.

354
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,800
Get ready.

355
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,720
Are you ready?

356
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,320
Why you two?

357
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,720
Lu Miao...

358
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,920
Has got diarrhea.

359
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,760
All right, then.

360
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,800
Coming right away.

361
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,440
Move.

362
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,360
Quickly.

363
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,640
Ready. Go.

364
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,480
Come on!

365
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,720
One! Two!

366
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,680
Hey!

367
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,480
One! Two!

368
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,440
Where are you taking me?

369
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,240
Let’s go.

370
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,840
We don’t have time.

371
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,440
Where are you going, Meng?

372
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,240
Let me go.

373
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,080
You can’t leave the crowd
without permission.

374
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,840
Jiang Haoyue’s birthday
comes only once in a year.

375
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,880
It is important.

376
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,480
The autumn trip comes
once in a year as well.

377
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,000
Let me go.

378
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,120
Get down.

379
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,680
Thanks, Ye.

380
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,360
I’ll treat you for snacks.

381
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,760
Are you a dog, Chlorophyll?

382
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,760
Go!

383
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,640
It’s your fault!

384
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,920
You took me here with you.

385
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,000
Stop talking. Make haste!

386
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,320
What’s taking you so long?

387
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,960
Speed up!

388
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,280
Are you done? Come on!

389
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,760
Idiot.

390
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,040
Hello.

391
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,560
Sorry.

392
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,600
It’s okay.

393
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,280
Your cake?

394
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,040
Yeah.

395
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,760
Here you go.

396
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,240
All right, bye.

397
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,960
Why did you come back?

398
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,160
Skipping the autumn trip is so cool.

399
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,400
How could I not do it?

400
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,920
Who is there?

401
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,440
Who?

402
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,000
Mr. Yang is coming.

403
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,400
We split up.

404
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,000
I saw you.

405
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,920
Which class are you in?

406
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,600
Stop!

407
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,920
Stop!

408
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,200
I’ll catch you.

409
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,480
Lu Miao?

410
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,040
Why are you here?

411
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,200
Never mind this.

412
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,040
Come with me!

413
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,880
Shi Che, stop!

414
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,960
Stop!

415
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,680
Why are we hiding here?

416
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,080
I wanted to celebrate your birthday.

417
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,040
One.

418
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,680
Two.

419
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,440
Three.

420
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,240
Four.

421
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,760
Five.

422
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,280
Six.

423
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,040
Seven.

424
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,320
Eight.

425
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,760
Nine.

426
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,280
Ten.

427
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,000
Ten seconds already.

428
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,760
He moved away his eyes first.

429
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,240
You...

430
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,200
You...

431
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,200
Gotcha!

432
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,760
Follow me to my office!

433
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,440
Oh, no!

434
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,760
What?

435
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,240
Have you become thinner?

436
00:22:16,521 --> 00:22:17,271
I got it.

437
00:22:17,281 --> 00:22:18,420
(Office of Educational Administration)

438
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,280
Lu Miao?

439
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,920
She’s in my office.

440
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,400
Shi Che in your class is here, too.

441
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,240
They’re all in school.

442
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:31,800
Whose birthday is it?

443
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,600
Mine.

444
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,320
Jiang Haoyue,

445
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,720
although Lu Miao is your sister,

446
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,400
you can’t cover for her every time.

447
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,960
Today really is my birthday.

448
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,320
Lu Miao,

449
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,920
Shi Che!

450
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,280
I must stress it one more time.

451
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,720
You mustn’t leave the group

452
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,080
without permission again!

453
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,880
Your teachers are trying
to be responsible for you.

454
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,360
Please stop causing

455
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,960
us more trouble.

456
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,640
- Got it!
- Got it!

457
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,560
Eat the cake, then.

458
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:23,160
Happy birthday to you.

459
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,640
Haoyue, happy birthday.

460
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,920
Meng...

461
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,840
Don’t come over.

462
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,520
Watch me!

463
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,080
Mr. Yang, I didn’t do it on purpose.

464
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:40,960
Shi Che!

465
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,480
I didn’t! I swear!

466
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:42,840
You!

467
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,320
You stop!

468
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,320
You stop there!

469
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,280
Shi Che, get over here!

470
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,240
You guys who play overnight,

471
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,720
pay the money now.

472
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,120
It hasn’t passed 13th yet.
What’s the rush?

473
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,000
What day is it today?

474
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,320
Did you get yourself drunk again?

475
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,520
13th.

476
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,640
You don’t remember the date?

477
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,780
(Brat)

478
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,280
Sorry,

479
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,840
the number you have dialed
is not available from this service.

480
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,120
Stupid signals.

481
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,560
You’re the host.

482
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,320
Come on, finish the last game.

483
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:45,880
What’s the rush?

484
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,840
You’re too eager to lose money?

485
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:15,020
(Son! Happy birthday!)

486
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,600
Son! happy birthday!

487
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,080
You’re here as expected.

488
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,960
You’re still awake.

489
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,120
This is for you.

490
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,280
What’s this?

491
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,440
Open it and have a look.

492
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,280
A shirt.

493
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,400
Try it on.

494
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,160
Where did you buy it?

495
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,840
I had it tailored for you.

496
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,040
Tailored?

497
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,840
How do you know my size?

498
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,480
Just try it on first.

499
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,520
Just as thought,

500
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,200
it’s too loose at the waist.

501
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,200
No, it’s fine.

502
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,480
I like it to be loose.

503
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,480
So...

504
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,640
You like the present, don’t you?

505
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,280
I do, very much.

506
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,120
Thank you.

507
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,400
Honestly,

508
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,840
you look more handsome
in the white shirt

509
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,640
than those stars on TV.

510
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,200
Do I?

511
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,880
Yeah.

512
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,920
Well,

513
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,240
handsome guy,

514
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,160
the seventeenth year of your life

515
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,840
has officially started.

516
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,240
Do you have any thoughts?

517
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,440
Thoughts?

518
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,920
I want to...

519
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,600
Be an adult as soon as possible.

520
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,360
What’s so good about being an adult?

521
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,320
When I’m an adult,

522
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,480
I get to make my own choices.

523
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,000
Then I want to be an adult, too.

524
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,320
You?

525
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,200
You can be a kid forever.

526
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,560
It’s your birthday,

527
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,360
so I’m going to let you off.

528
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,280
Oh, yeah.

529
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,680
This card was going to...

530
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,960
Never mind.

531
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,960
Open it when you get back.

532
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,460
(Mom)

533
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,280
Hello, mom.

534
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,040
Hello, son.

535
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,160
Happy birthday.

536
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,080
Thanks.

537
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,200
I was busy all day.

538
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,400
Sorry for being late.

539
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,080
I wanted to call you in the daytime.

540
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,560
It’s okay.

541
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,800
I have a present for you.

542
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,920
You’re a big boy now.

543
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,080
I want you to live with me,

544
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,120
so you can receive better education.

545
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,960
Also...

546
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,280
Also you can be rid of Jiang Yi
for good.

547
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,960
You and I both know that

548
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,720
Jiang Yi will never turn good.

549
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,720
He’ll eventually become your liability.

550
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,840
But he won’t let me go.

551
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,760
You’ll be an adult a year later.

552
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,000
You’ll be able to choose your own path.

553
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,440
I also wish to make my own choices.

554
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,440
No worries.

555
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,000
Oh, have you made a wish?

556
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,400
Not yet.

557
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,760
Make one to me, then.

558
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,560
I want...

559
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,920
It’s okay if you have no idea.

560
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,215
I owe you one.

561
00:29:40,215 --> 00:29:41,265
When you’re here with me,

562
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:42,490
everything becomes easy.

563
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,800
I wish that all of your dreams
would come true.

564
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,160
Haoyue,

565
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,680
this is your birthday present.

566
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,640
You can have it.

567
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,480
Say thank you.

568
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,520
Thank you.

569
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,920
Why did you give the present from me

570
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,640
to a stranger?

571
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,280
You!

572
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,720
