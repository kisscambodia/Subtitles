00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,840
Give me one.

35
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,360
One for each.

36
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,960
Fill it and give it to me.

37
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,760
All right.

38
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,040
The old man is the murderer.

39
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,520
How annoying you are!

40
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,520
Meng,

41
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,880
you really don’t recognize me?

42
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,360
Meng?

43
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,880
What do you think?

44
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,400
It’s the new nickname I gave you.

45
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,080
Do you like it?

46
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,160
I don’t.

47
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,200
Why?

48
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,120
Lu Miao is abbreviated to LM.

49
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,360
Lu Meng is also abbreviated to LM.

50
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,720
It suits you a lot.

51
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,520
Lu Meng sounds much powerful.

52
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,040
Lu Meng.

53
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,360
Lu Meng.

54
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,160
It doesn’t suit me at all!

55
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,200
All right, then.

56
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,560
Before I come up with a new name,

57
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,840
use it now.

58
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,520
Miao,

59
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,440
do you have some tissues?

60
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,120
Yes.

61
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,720
You know each other?

62
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,120
Yes.

63
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,880
No.

64
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,720
Miao?

65
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,800
Don’t call me like that.

66
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,360
We’re not friends.

67
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,400
You really don’t know me?

68
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,720
Stop!

69
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,920
You’re the weird guy
who rode a bicycle!

70
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,560
What weird guy?

71
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,840
I’m just unique.

72
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,120
What about your unique fringe?

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,400
For my dream,

74
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,440
it was sacrificed.

75
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,600
Son,

76
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,120
listen to me.

77
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,280
When your father feels happy,

78
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,480
he may approve of your admission
to ﻿the school team.

79
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,360
Cut it.

80
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,760
Fill it and give it to me.

81
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,160
May I borrow your pen?

82
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,240
You can play basketball?

83
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,840
After I’m in,

84
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,840
I’ll rewrite the history

85
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,120
of the Basketball Team

86
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,760
of No.1 High School.

87
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,880
How narcissistic!

88
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,040
Wait and see.

89
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,200
Come on!

90
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,080
Come on, Shi Che!

91
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,960
Come on, Shi Che!

92
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:20,640
Come on!

93
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,400
Come on, Shi Che!

94
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,720
Come on!

95
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,000
Come on, everybody!

96
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,080
Whether you can be admitted
to the school team

97
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,200
depends on the last ten seconds.

98
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,560
Shi Che did a good job.

99
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,200
Excuse me.

100
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,080
Thank you.

101
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,120
It’s down there.

102
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,040
Down there.

103
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,840
It’s here.

104
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,240
Where’s Shi Che’s name?

105
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:43,880
How’s it?

106
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,080
Nothing.

107
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,480
Go to the toilet with me.

108
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:46,760
Go.

109
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,560
What?

110
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:47,840
Let me have a look.

111
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:50,880
There’s...

112
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,040
There’s obviously something wrong.

113
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,000
It...

114
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,160
Isn’t that Qu Wei?

115
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,240
Last year, he won the first prize
of the ﻿National Chemistry Contest.

116
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,320
When he’s here,

117
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,800
we’ll fail again, won’t we?

118
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,840
Seriously?

119
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,960
Jiang Haoyue?

120
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,920
The contest demon from No.1 High School?

121
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,640
He’s said to win all first prizes.

122
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,920
Isn’t he in the Physics Group?

123
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,040
Why is he coming
to the Chemistry Contest?

124
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,520
Maybe he wants to win all science prizes

125
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,840
during the high school.

126
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,440
Then Qu Wei will fail

127
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,080
to win the first prize this year.

128
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,720
In the cube ABCD,

129
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,360
prove B1D1 is perpendicular to A1C1.

130
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:49,920
Ziye,

131
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,120
how shall I solve this problem?

132
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,760
Listen to the teacher first.

133
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,640
I’ll tell you after class.

134
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,760
Geometry proofs like this

135
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,000
will help you

136
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,200
to consolidate basic knowledge points.

137
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,360
You can’t do wrong

138
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,240
in steps or resolving theories.

139
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,000
With established resolving theories,

140
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,560
you’ll also find a solution

141
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,040
and make the problem simple

142
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,280
even when you meet harder problems.

143
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,040
Lu Miao, why are you interested in anything

144
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,840
but math problems?

145
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,680
Come and solve this problem.

146
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,440
Because ABCD is a cube,

147
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,760
BD is perpendicular to AC.

148
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,800
What S?

149
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,680
What do you mean?

150
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,280
AC, not S.

151
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,640
AC.

152
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,440
Go back to your seat.

153
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,760
Don’t be absent-minded again.

154
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,120
All right. So much for today.

155
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,560
Class is over.

156
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,440
Where’s Shi Che?

157
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,040
Don’t ask.

158
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,000
He failed the selection
of the school basketball team.

159
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,000
What do we do?

160
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,040
What else can we do?

161
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,040
As usual,

162
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,440
he will either

163
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,320
drop out of school

164
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,800
or harass the whole school.

165
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,560
He’s so conceited?

166
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,480
Because Principle Shi is his father.

167
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,040
Captain,

168
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,400
did someone ask you to reject me?

169
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,600
I understand.

170
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,120
When a basketball genius like me

171
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,160
failed the selection,

172
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,160
there could be only one reason.

173
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,480
My father ordered you.

174
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,240
He wants to stifle a basketball genius

175
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,360
in the cradle

176
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,960
and stop him from coming into being!

177
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,840
So, he forced you to reject me,

178
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,080
right?

179
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,240
Shi Che,

180
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,200
you’re a good player.

181
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,600
But we considered that...

182
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,360
I’m right, huh?

183
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,880
I knew there was a plot.

184
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,800
When you considered,
someone threatened you.

185
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,240
Right?

186
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,440
I don’t blame you.

187
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,800
You might have argued for me.

188
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,880
But...

189
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,120
The pure basketball world

190
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,960
mustn’t be staid.

191
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,480
Do you mean stained?

192
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,520
Whatever.

193
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,000
Go on with the practice.

194
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,960
I knew what happened.

195
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,040
Now that someone uses

196
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,960
such a mean method

197
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,240
to block a genius,

198
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,960
I’ll fight against him.

199
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,000
All right.

200
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,680
Go on with your practice.

201
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,360
I won’t sell you out.

202
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,480
Don’t worry.

203
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,720
Sell me out?

204
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,800
What’s the problem with him?

205
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:50,600
Hello.

206
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,560
I’m Qu Wei.

207
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,120
Last year, I won the first prize
of the National Chemistry Contest.

208
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,640
I want to compete with you.

209
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,760
Don’t feel stressed out.

210
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,280
It’s just a friendly communication.

211
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,520
There’s no winning

212
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,640
or losing.

213
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,680
You can’t defeat me by praying.

214
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,560
Don’t bother me unless you have to.

215
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,880
What?

216
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,520
Scared already?

217
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,160
You’ve gotten ink on your hand.

218
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,440
I know. I know.

219
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,680
Yes. It’s my bad.

220
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,280
I forgot that yesterday.

221
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,960
Or I would have sent it to you.

222
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,240
Yes. What poor memories I have!

223
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,560
Sorry for that.

224
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,280
All right.

225
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,080
I’ll keep it in mind.

226
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,480
I will...

227
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,320
Stop!

228
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,640
No, I don’t mean you.

229
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,280
I’m sorry.

230
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,680
All right.

231
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,240
I know.

232
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,960
Your head teacher talked to me today,

233
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,080
specially making a phone call.

234
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,160
Do you know why?

235
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,280
You think we’re dancing?

236
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,600
Mom.

237
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,000
You had low points in the quiz.

238
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,800
Do you know why?

239
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,600
You don’t do your homework every day.

240
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,840
When Haoyue isn’t in class,

241
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,800
you can’t do your homework alone

242
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,840
because no one keeps an eye on you. Right?

243
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,640
I’ll confiscate all your comic books.

244
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,960
You mustn’t watch TV this term.

245
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,360
Got it?

246
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,000
Mom, give them back to me.

247
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Before you make progress in study

248
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,480
or complete your homework,

249
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,720
don’t call me Mom.

250
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,920
You think I can’t restrain you?

251
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,080
Hello, Mr. Liu.

252
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,960
So, you really met a rival

253
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,760
when you were there?

254
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,240
I asked you to be cautious

255
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,160
because of the unlucky divination stick.

256
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,080
Luckily, you’re taking the luck charm

257
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,120
I gave you.

258
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,240
You know what?

259
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,680
You must carry it with you.

260
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,080
It’s for self-protection.

261
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,080
All right. Rest assured.

262
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,040
When are you coming back?

263
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,240
You have no idea.

264
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,440
When you’re away,

265
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,400
my mother is just like a stepmother.

266
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,520
I was simply away for two days.

267
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,080
You’re coming back in three days.

268
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,160
It’s not even the middle.

269
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,040
Have you done half of the problems
I left you?

270
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,160
Sorry, the number you have dialed
is powered off.

271
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,480
Sorry, the number you have...

272
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,200
Dialed is powered off.

273
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,240
Please call back late.

274
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,960
All right.

275
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,720
Go do your homework.

276
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:22,800
Good girl.

277
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,040
Everybody,

278
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,640
handle your personal grooming quickly.

279
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:33,840
My hair...

280
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,720
If you’re done, take your seats.

281
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,960
When you’re not done...

282
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,240
I forgot to wear the hairpin.

283
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,320
You, stand outside!

284
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,320
Use this.

285
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,160
I’m born with curly hair.

286
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:46,960
Put it on.

287
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,760
I had the curly hair
as early as in junior high.

288
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,840
Yes.

289
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,320
You’re not qualified.

290
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:52,800
That’s great.

291
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,440
The boy in Class 10, Grade 1,

292
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,720
why are you covering your head?

293
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,160
Come up.

294
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:07,840
Everybody,

295
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,760
if you’re like him,

296
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,560
don’t have the idea

297
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,320
of leaving things to chance.

298
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,240
Take off your hood.

299
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,920
Cool, man.

300
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:33,800
Shi Che!

301
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,960
What do you mean?

302
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,880
Principal Shi,

303
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,840
I dyed my hair
with your private savings.

304
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,200
Does it look cool?

305
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,520
You’ll be recorded with a grave demerit.

306
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:46,960
Director Yang,

307
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,560
kick him out.

308
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,360
Before he dyes his hair black,

309
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,080
he isn’t allowed to come to school!

310
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,960
Silence!

311
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,120
What’s this about?

312
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,520
Like father, like son.

313
00:13:17,978 --> 00:13:19,298
Goodbye,

314
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,920
Conan.

315
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,360
Goodbye,

316
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,600
Naruto.

317
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,320
Goodbye, Sakuragi.

318
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,280
It’s here.

319
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,840
I wondered why I couldn’t
find the whole pack.

320
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,320
I haven’t returned it yet.

321
00:13:35,228 --> 00:13:36,548
Why are you here?

322
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,800
Why are you returning the books

323
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,120
before you finish reading them?

324
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,080
My mother asked me to do this.

325
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,720
A poor student can’t enjoy comics.

326
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,360
How about this?

327
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,640
I’ll rent

328
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,480
all your comic books.

329
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,040
If you want to read them, come to me.

330
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,960
You’re Mr. Arrogance?

331
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,640
What?

332
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,680
You borrowed all books

333
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,600
I had wanted to read.

334
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,080
We have the same taste.

335
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,400
I’m not as cool as you.

336
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,200
I hear you have the red hair,

337
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,320
to revolt against your father?

338
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,400
Not exactly.

339
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,640
I wanted to have red hair long ago.

340
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:19,960
You know what?

341
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,400
It looks cool.

342
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,840
Don’t pull a long face.

343
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,520
Go.

344
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,880
Let me make you happy!

345
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:38,960
Here we are.

346
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,280
Basketball court?

347
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,480
All problems

348
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,040
can be solved by a slam dunk.

349
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,160
I don’t think I’m tall enough
to do a slam dunk.

350
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,000
It doesn’t matter.

351
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,320
Do you want it or not?

352
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,520
I...

353
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,080
Pretend that this is your problem.

354
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,600
Smash it hard.

355
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,080
Dunk.

356
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,320
To the left.

357
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:17,840
To the right.

358
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,760
Yes. Stop.

359
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,440
Remember to hang there.

360
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,160
That’s the essential part!

361
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,360
All right.

362
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,600
Here I go.

363
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,840
Good shot!

364
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,800
Move a little bit.

365
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,280
What do you want?

366
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:46,920
Move a little bit.

367
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,240
I think you have a soul
for basketball, too.

368
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,160
No, I don’t.

369
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,440
Get down.

370
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,080
Don’t panic.

371
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,920
The hoop won’t break.

372
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,200
Guoguo and I often do this together.

373
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,400
I can’t hold on.

374
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,080
Go down and get me a ladder!

375
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,600
I won’t.

376
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,520
I want to play basketball!

377
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,840
Math homework, go away!

378
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,080
Do you really
love playing basketball that much?

379
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:24,680
I’m not sure.

380
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,080
But at this moment,

381
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,440
I love basketball most.

382
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,800
If you simply want to play basketball,

383
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,400
you don’t have to play
in the school team.

384
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,080
There’s club recruitment.

385
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,880
When you establish a basketball club,

386
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,520
you can also play frankly.

387
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,200
With my father working there,

388
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,240
he’ll certainly decline my application.

389
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,360
You can

390
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,840
use my name.

391
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,080
Come to school tomorrow.

392
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,000
Then I’ll lose my red hair,

393
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,760
won’t I?

394
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,680
Just sacrifice it for your dream.

395
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:05,920
In return,

396
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,760
let me teach you something.

397
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,640
Do you know the most important thing

398
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,280
in application problems?

399
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,320
Application.

400
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,440
What are you doing?

401
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,480
Why do I hear paper cutting?

402
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,840
I’m doing the math problem.

403
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,880
Wait until I finish the...

404
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,040
The triangular pyramid.

405
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,160
What’s the angle of ABC?

406
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,080
When I measure it, I’ll know.

407
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,520
What an idea!

408
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,240
Are you going to hand in the model

409
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,200
when handing in your homework?

410
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,120
Sure.

411
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,720
It’s how I solve problems.

412
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,400
Then your teacher needs

413
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,520
a large office.

414
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,560
Why?

415
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,720
Before you graduate,

416
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,200
your models will pile up like a pyramid.

417
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,240
You don’t understand.

418
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,040
All roads lead to Rome.

419
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,320
I’m pushing application problems

420
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,520
back to problem.

421
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,400
Who taught you such a new idea?

422
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,880
Shi Che did.

423
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,640
Shi Che?

424
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,120
A new student in our class.

425
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,840
He’s Mr. Arrogance,

426
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,640
who borrowed all comic books that

427
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,360
I wanted to read.

428
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,600
I never expected him

429
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,560
to have the same taste as mine

430
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,600
in comics.

431
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,200
I appreciate him.

432
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,320
I’ll send you his photo next time.

433
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,360
By the way,

434
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,840
in the alley that night,

435
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,200
he helped us.

436
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,480
He was the unique boy.

437
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,160
But now,

438
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,560
he has cut

439
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,040
his weird fringe

440
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,680
for his basketball dream

441
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,080
and abandoned it.

442
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,160
With my help,

443
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,280
he even established the Basketball Club.

444
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,080
What a sudden change!

445
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,140
A rival is coming.

446
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,840
What did you say?

447
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:55,960
Nothing.

448
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,800
Have you solved the problem?

449
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,880
Not yet.

450
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,640
Try and make a perpendicular line.

451
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,160
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

452
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,720
I didn’t have to make the model.

453
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,480
What do I do now?

454
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,560
I’ve pasted it.

455
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,880
You kept talking about that student.

456
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,000
All right.

457
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,880
Go to bed early.

458
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,480
I’ll hang up.

459
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,000
Not bad.

460
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,780
(Open it, please.)

461
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,640
Your student Lu Miao
is an interesting girl.

462
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,160
Many students in my class

463
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,480
are quite interesting.

464
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,360
Dribble with your hands, all right?

465
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,400
Mind your pace.

466
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,400
Dribble with your hands.

467
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,440
Preserve the formation.

468
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,240
Follow up.

469
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,200
Follow up.

470
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,200
Keep it low.

471
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,280
Our...

472
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,400
Our application...

473
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,200
It’s approved?

474
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,840
No.

475
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,800
Our application...

476
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,160
When we were checking the result,

477
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,000
the teacher for club business said

478
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,280
he didn’t see our application.

479
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,280
Yes.

480
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,320
But I’m sure that

481
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,480
I gave him the application personally.

482
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,280
Sounds so familiar.

483
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,040
I’m going to see him.

484
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,920
So, is he going to...?

485
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,480
As the principle of our school,

486
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,480
can’t you be fair?

487
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,000
I’m also a student!

488
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,360
What do you want?

489
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,280
(Principal’s Office)
Approve the basketball club.

490
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,840
No way.

491
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,080
Then I’ll drop out of school

492
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,720
and come back as a PE student
and serve in the school team.

493
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,680
You can have a try.

494
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,480
Hello, Principle Shi.

495
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,040
I’m Lu Miao.

496
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,000
Lu for Lu You

497
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,200
and Miao for trees.

498
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,800
We’re...

499
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,760
Hello, Principle Shi.

500
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,080
We’re members of the basketball team.

501
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,840
We applied,

502
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,840
strictly following the school rules.

503
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,320
If you don’t approve it,

504
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,840
please give us

505
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,800
a reasonable explanation.

506
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,720
Our school doesn’t need

507
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,640
two basketball groups.

508
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,920
Then please give us

509
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,400
a fair chance to compete.

510
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,120
We can compete with the school team.

511
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:37,960
All right.

512
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,840
As you wish.

513
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,440
If you lose,

514
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,080
come back and study!

515
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,960
How many members do we need
for the match?

516
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,280
Three, including alternates.

517
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,880
How can I find three students?

518
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,720
When you asked me to join the club,

519
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,480
why didn’t you consider it?

520
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,560
I didn’t know
there weren’t enough members.

521
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,240
I was too excited and I...

522
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,120
How daring!

523
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,400
I admire you.

524
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,400
Is it a curse or compliment?

525
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,200
All right.

526
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,800
Do we really stand no chance to win?

527
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,480
Let me explain.

528
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,240
When we compete with the school team,

529
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,400
it’s like...

530
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,680
Naruto who doesn’t have ninja arts

531
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,665
competes with Orochimaru.

532
00:22:24,925 --> 00:22:26,184
Or Luffy who can’t use Haki

533
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,284
competes with a Shogun.

534
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,440
We’ll be crushed.

535
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,840
But it concerns

536
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,480
whether our club can be established.

537
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,800
They got the chance for us.

538
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,400
We can’t give up.

539
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,400
You’re suddenly getting serious?

540
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,000
I’m always serious

541
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,960
about basketball issues.

542
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:44,960
Recruitment!

543
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,440
Training!

544
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:47,480
Match!

545
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,360
Only three things.

546
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,480
Can’t we do it?

547
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,600
We can!

548
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,800
You don’t need to be so loud.

549
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,160
We can’t be stronger

550
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,840
simply by yelling loudly.

551
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,480
Can we make it?

552
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,120
We can!

553
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:05,960
Good.

554
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,680
Recruitment, training and match.

555
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,240
This Friday,

556
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,360
we’re having a basketball match
with the school team.

557
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:14,960
But so far,

558
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,000
we haven’t had enough players yet.

559
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,040
This afternoon,

560
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,960
Shi Che and I were handing out

561
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,040
the recruitment leaflets.

562
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,040
But only one student came.

563
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,640
Students like sports, don’t they?

564
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,120
Only three days left.

565
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,080
Will we lose

566
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,560
even before the match starts?

567
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,440
It’s my fault.

568
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,960
I was too impulsive.

569
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,760
I shouldn’t have set a goal so quickly.

570
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,520
Don’t worry.

571
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,200
Maybe when you wake up tomorrow,

572
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,800
you’ll have enough players.

573
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,800
You’ve received

574
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,640
higher education.

575
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,080
How can you talk nonsense?

576
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,200
Go to sleep early.

577
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:14,020
(Recruitment for the Basketball Club)

578
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,640
I had some prejudice

579
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,160
against you.

580
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,400
I never expected you
to be so hot-blooded.

581
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,280
Welcome to the Basketball Club.

582
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,880
Come for the training.

583
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,440
Cheng, why are you coming here?

584
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,160
Jiang Haoyue said
if I joined the Basketball Club,

585
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,560
I could do two sets of papers less.

586
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,280
I come for the same reason.

587
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,600
Huanggang papers are quite hard.

588
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,120
Yes.

589
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,920
Zhang Cheng,

590
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,520
go over there.

591
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,200
Wang Xinwen, go over there.

592
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:41,640
All right.

593
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,200
OK.

594
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,480
By the way,

595
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,520
here’s our team uniform.

596
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,760
Let’s have a look.

597
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,960
Why do I feel something missing

598
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,960
on our team uniform

599
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,920
compared to the professional uniform
of the school team?

600
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,280
Don’t you think so?

601
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,320
Leave it to me.

602
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,840
Where is it?

603
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,800
Looking for this?

604
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,840
What exactly do you want?

605
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,560
Want it back?

606
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,680
Compete with me.

607
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,160
You want a competition, huh?

608
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:08,800
OK.

609
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,720
But you should wager on something.

610
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,760
Whoever loses will buy midnight snack
for everybody.

611
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,160
Good idea.

612
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,360
We’ll enjoy midnight snack.

613
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,000
No problem.

614
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,720
Pick a contest problem randomly.

615
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,240
Whoever solves it first

616
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:24,760
will win.

617
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,440
Whatever.

618
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,720
Game starts. Please turn around.

619
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,100
(Chemistry Contest Problem)

620
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:46,920
What?

621
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:47,920
You’re afraid that you’ll lose?

622
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,520
I give you ten seconds ahead.

623
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,980
Jiang Haoyue is using a perfect way

624
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,240
to solve the problem.

625
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,480
He’s indeed the contest demon.

626
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,600
Qu Wei, I want barbecue
for midnight snack!

627
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,480
I want crayfishes.

628
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,440
I’m not picky.

629
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,640
I’m OK with anything.

630
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,980
(Chemistry Contest Problem)

631
00:27:46,037 --> 00:27:48,437
I never expected Jiang Haoyue
to solve the problem so wonderfully.

632
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,960
We won’t win the first prize again.

633
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,400
How awesome he is!

634
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,040
Qu Wei was one minute later

635
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,280
in solving the problem.

636
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,760
Look, this is Shi Che.

637
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,880
This Friday,

638
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,160
we’ll compete with the school team.

639
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,320
Considering the strength,

640
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,440
the Basketball Club will be crushed

641
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,840
very completely.

642
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,240
Shi Che and his members

643
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,560
will be disgraced.

644
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,120
The game starts momentarily.

645
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,640
Come on!

646
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,440
We won’t show mercy.

647
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,240
Come on then.

648
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,000
Defense!

649
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,720
It’s OK. One more time.

650
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,120
Defense!

651
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,080
Defense! Defense!

652
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,040
Come on!

653
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,920
Shi Che, you’re great!

654
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,560
Guoguo, come on!

655
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,400
Defense!

656
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,360
Come on!

657
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,600
Come on!

658
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,800
Pass the ball to me.

659
00:29:59,575 --> 00:30:02,265
Come on!

660
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:03,800
Shi Che!

661
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,160
Come on!

662
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,880
Time’s up.

663
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,080
The school team won.

664
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,080
It’s OK, Che.

665
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,400
We did our best. It’s worth it.

666
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,280
Let’s go have lunch.

667
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,040
Principle Shi.

668
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,400
Principle Shi.

669
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,240
Lu Miao.

670
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,320
Principle Shi,

671
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,560
what do you think of our performance?

672
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,200
Good. You played the game bravely.

673
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,480
I’m proud of you.

674
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,000
The Basketball Club...?

675
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,000
Shi Che...

676
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,840
A rule is a rule.

677
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,680
Go back home early.

678
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:03,440
Lu Miao.

679
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,960
Why are you here?

680
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,320
I came as soon as I was back
from the training.

681
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,680
How was the basketball match?

682
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,480
We lost.

683
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,400
It doesn’t matter.

684
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,400
The result isn’t important.

685
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,360
You’ve tried.

686
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,280
Meng,

687
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:18,960
let’s go have lunch.

688
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:23,520
Who...?

689
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,160
Who is this?

690
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,080
Jiang Haoyue.

691
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,880
He’s my brother.

692
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,320
You’re Shi Che?

693
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,120
You’re Jiang Haoyue?

694
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,920
It’s you?

695
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,920
You’re the only student
who doesn’t know him.

696
00:31:46,178 --> 00:31:47,875
Would you like to have lunch with us?

697
00:31:48,928 --> 00:31:50,046
No.

698
00:31:50,906 --> 00:31:51,640
Okay.

699
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,760
