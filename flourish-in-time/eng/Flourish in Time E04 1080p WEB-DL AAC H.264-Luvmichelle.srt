Jiang Haoyue’s so serious.

He’s a super straight-A student.

33

I don’t know what to say to him.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,240
You’re a good student. Say something.

We’ll do it ourselves.

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,160
We will.

39
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,720
Thank you.

40
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:10,920
Che,

41
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,760
try the chili sauce. It’s super spicy.

42
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,160
You’ll feel too hot to speak.

43
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,640
Try some.

44
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,640
Miao,

45
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,960
Che is always afraid of spicy food.

46
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,440
Nonsense!

47
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,440
How can a real man
be afraid of spicy food?

48
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,840
Try some, then.

49
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,880
Look, he’s funny.

50
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,320
Have some water.

51
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,080
Aren’t you afraid of inner fever
when eating so much chili sauce?

52
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,080
I won’t have inner fever.

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,640
Be careful.

54
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,240
If you get chili stain on your T-shirt,
it can’t be washed away.

55
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,600
Eat more meat.

56
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,800
You should eat less.

57
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,240
Have more vegetables.

58
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,120
She has been holding her phone lately.

59
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,320
At first, I thought

60
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,560
she liked you.

61
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,320
Then I knew you were her brother.

62
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,440
Lu Miao told me about you.

63
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,640
Thank you for helping her
with the application problems.

64
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,240
He doesn’t help a lot.

65
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,960
I’m clever enough.

66
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,040
And you often urge me to study.

67
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,800
Reflect on yourself

68
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,400
why you always keep others worry.

69
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,040
We’re sitting across the table.

70
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,160
What are you whispering?

71
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,840
Tell me about it.

72
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,760
Don’t ask.

73
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,080
Aren’t you coming for food?

74
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,320
Che, this tastes great.

75
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,480
Try some. It’s delicious.

76
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,080
Meng,

77
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,920
do you like any boy in our high school?

78
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,000
No.

79
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,280
Your brother sounds like a parent.

80
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,680
Don’t learn from him.

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,360
He looks like a stick-in-the-mud

82
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,520
and he’s always cold.

83
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,120
Che, stop.

84
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,840
Don’t ask for it.

85
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,040
Jiang Haoyue is horrible.

86
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,240
What are you talking about?

87
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,480
He isn’t a stick-in-the-mud.

88
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,000
He isn’t cold, either.

89
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,680
He’s just too cool to reach.

90
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,440
He’s my model for progress.

91
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,040
Ziye,

92
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,840
don’t get choked.

93
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,600
Wipe your mouth.

94
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,280
I’m fine.

95
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,880
The water is just too hot.

96
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,000
Isn’t it cold water?

97
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,920
Shi Che is enthusiastic to you.

98
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,720
Yes.

99
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,040
He and I kind of have similar interests.

100
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,240
But he’s just an outgoing boy.

101
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,200
He’s nice to everyone.

102
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,280
He is?

103
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,480
What about you?

104
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,960
How was your training course?

105
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,320
Not bad.

106
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,680
What happened to your rival?

107
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,240
He lost.

108
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,800
I knew it!

109
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,920
My luck charm must have helped.

110
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,200
It’s because of probability.

111
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,720
What probability?

112
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,320
My luck charm helped.

113
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,480
Where’s it?

114
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,040
Did you lose it?

115
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,320
In my pocket.

116
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,120
The right one.

117
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,400

118
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,960
have you maintained
your fifth position to last?

119
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,120
Go. Be quick.

120
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,040
Go back home.

121
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,600
My mother has made cordyceps soup
for three days,

122
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,880

let me show you something great.

If you have any doubt during the exam,

raise your hand and ask me.

136
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,520
No students shall come in
when he’s late for over 15 minutes.

137

You can’t hand in the paper
until one hour after it starts.

138
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,000
May I come in?

139
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,320
Come in.

140
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,520

it’s been a while.

I never expected to be
your desk mate.

146
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,240
But you won’t win this time.

147
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,480
When the bell rings,

148
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,800
you must stop immediately.

149
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,560

I’m sure I’m not on the ranking list.

Why don’t you check it for your brother?

155
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,160
I don’t need to.

156
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,480
He must be No. 1 again.

157
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,840

158
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,440

Excuse me.

Who’s Qu Wei?

164
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,520
According to my father,

165
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,840
he’s a top student
we got from No. 5 High School.

166
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,080
My brother was defeated?

167
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,320
He’s at least No. 2.

168
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,680
Do you need to worry so much?

169
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,480
But he was always No. 1.

170
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,000
As a student who failed the exams,

171
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,080
why do you worry about him?

did you check the scores?

186
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,240
Yes.

187
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,240
You’ll admit defeat, won’t you?

188
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,880
What?

189
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,840

00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,800
to say anything?

191
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,560
What are you doing?

192
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,200
Our group is on duty today.

193
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,480
Wipe the outer side of the windows.

194
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,100
(Teachers’ Office)

195
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,600
Mr. Wen,

196
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,960
what’s wrong?

197
00:09:10,665 --> 00:09:11,185
Nothing.

198
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,320
Scores of the Monthly Test
have been announced.

199
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,200
My class is the last again.

200
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,320
And it’s still one of my students

201
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,280
who has the lowest scores in the grade.

202
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,960
They’re in Grade 1 now.

203
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,800
Why do you panic?

204
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
Chen,

205
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,560
when you taught Grade 1,

206
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,120
you were the strictest.

207
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,040
Mr. Wen,

208
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,120
this is when you must panic.

209
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,280
So…

210
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,320
What can I do?

211
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,120
Who’s the class teacher, you or I?

212
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,520
Well,

213
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,760
you must keep rules
for reward and punishment.

214
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,520
Don’t let anything

215
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,360
that is against the rule happen.

216
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,360
You’re softhearted.

217
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,320
If you don’t do something,

218
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,440
you can’t restrain your students.

219
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,200
Remember,

220
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,240
there’re no bad students,

221
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,560
but only poor teachers.

222
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,720
Enough, Ms. Lei.

223
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,080
Could you stop?

224
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,680
Mr. Wen just became a class teacher.

225
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,840
He and his students need time to grow.

226
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,160
Chen,

227
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,200
don’t go too far.

228
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,680
Jiang Haoyue and Qu Wei

229
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,640
in your class

230
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,360
are both candidates for top scorers.

231
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,880
Your work is quite easy.

232
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,960
The tea is so hot.

233
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,000
I’m going to check on my class.

234
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,960
You’ve done the survey so quickly?

235
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,600
I roughly collected the intel

236
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,320
and got some basic information.

237
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,560
But he’s now No. 1 on my ranking list.

238
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,600
What?

239
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,240
My brother isn’t No. 1?

240
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,120
Come on.

241
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,280
It’s just a monthly test.

242
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,320
Why are you also...?

243
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,360
Why did you change so quickly?

244
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,720
I didn’t change.

245
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,720
The recorded students changed.

246
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,400
Tell me.

247
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,080
What makes Qu Wei better

248
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,880
than my brother?

249
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,880
- Expectations.
- Expectations?

250
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,520
Yes.

251
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,960
Jiang Haoyue has always been No. 1.

252
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
Everyone is used

253
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,320
to his first place.

254
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,960
Suddenly, a transfer student appeared,

255
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,440
who is as good as Jiang Haoyue

256
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,680
and may even be stronger.

257
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,880
He’s absolutely eye-catching.

258
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,160
You just want something fresh, right?

259
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,240
Wait.

260
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,960
My brother will be No. 1 again.

261
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,840
Let’s wait and see.

262
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,360
For this Chemistry Tryout,

263
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,080
our school has only one quota.

264
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,160
Jiang Haoyue,

265
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,200
you’re better at Physics.

266
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,880
Why don’t you apply for Physics

267
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,360
and give this chance to Qu Wei?

268
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,160
Mr. Chen,

269
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,600
I want to strive for this chance.

270
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,920
I don’t need him to give me the chance.

271
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,160
A great man cannot

272
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,200
brook a rival.

273
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,440
I’ve compiled some files for the tryout.

274
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,280
Take them back to class

275
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,920
and review them

276
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,800
with other contestants.

277
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,320
I’ll leave you alone,
if you want nothing else.

278
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:42,880
All right.

279
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,580
(Laboratory Building)

280
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,320
In the training camp,
I saw how you operated.

281
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:07,800
Not bad.

282
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,120
I hear you’re good at Physics.

283
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,560
When you go to the Physics Contest

284
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,320
and I go to the Chemistry Contest,

285
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,640
we can both be No. 1.

286
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,680
But you insist on competing with me?

287
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,040
Are you kidding me?

288
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,640
I don’t know

289
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,200
why you made such an unwise decision.

290
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,160
But I want you to be fully prepared.

291
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,920
The tryout of our school is carried out
according to the provincial contest,

292
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,560
containing the theoretical experiment
and the experimental operation.

293
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,120
Even if you have
as much knowledge as me,

294
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,960
how many Olympic experiments
have you done?

295
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,280
You won’t defeat me.

296
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,520
Thank you for cooperation.

297
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,000
When you leave,

298
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,600
remember to close the door.

299
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,560
That’s Qu Wei?

300
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
I heard that

301
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,080
you would knock him out

302
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,680
in the Chemistry Tryout.

303
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,240
I’m not very confident.

304
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,480
I understand how you feel.

305
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,280
But don’t lose confidence for that.

306
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:25,840
Look.

307
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,480
I failed two exams in the monthly test.

308
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,000
But I didn’t give up on myself.

309
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,800
The failure of the monthly test

310
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,200
can be a minor setback.

311
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,000
Anyway, being No. 2 is already awesome.

312
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,040
Students gossip about you at school.

313
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,440
Don’t care about that.

314
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,680
I always support you.

315
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,080
So...?

316
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,920
So, I’m enlightening you.

317
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,400
I don’t study as well as you.

318
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,720
But you must admit that

319
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,720
I have more experience than you

320
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,240
in psychological construction.

321
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,280
I should thank you then.

322
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,760
Are you confident now?

323
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,720
No.

324
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,160
Then why must you compete with him?

325
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,560
Why don’t you

326
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,240
pick the Physics Contest?

327
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,160
Don’t worry.

328
00:14:33,236 --> 00:14:35,820
(How to help others with Chemistry?)

329
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,320
So many words.

330
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,840
You’re writing a composition?

331
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,720
I’m helping Jiang Haoyue
to look for methods

332
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,000
to improve his Chemistry.

333
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,160
A poor student like you

334
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,400
helps a straight-A student

335
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,240
to improve his study?

336
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,440
Amazing.

337
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,480
You’re sticking your nose
where it doesn’t belong.

338
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,760
Why don’t you improve your own study?

339
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,320
Mom,

340
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,880
helping others may make our own day.

341
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,840
When I’m helping him,

342
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,640
I’m also helping myself.

343
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,760
Good.

344
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,040
Very good.

345
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,600
When you fail an exam again,

346
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,840
I’ll put a password

347
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,520
to your computer.

348
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,600
It hurts!

349
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,280
Mom!

350
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,440
- Let go of me!
- What do you think?

351
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,160
Let go of me!

352
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,080
It hurts, doesn’t it?

353
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,000
Remember how it feels.

354
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,240
Study hard!

355
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,240
I know.

356
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,960
Washing it yourself?

357
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,920
Why didn’t you have it washed?

358
00:15:55,276 --> 00:15:56,236
To save money.

359
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,280
What I told you last time...

360
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,960
I don’t have money.

361
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,320
I’m pushed hard lately.

362
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,640
I’ll pay you back when I have money.

363
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,040
I’ll pay a 3% rate on it,

364
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,640
all right?

365
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,680
I have my own family to raise.

366
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,040
I don’t have spare money!

367
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,120
Don’t try to fool me!

368
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,200
You won’t lend me money, huh?

369
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,200
Lin Wenfang!

370
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,480
What are you doing?

371
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,480
Are you nuts?

372
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,720
Fine.

373
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,280
Fine.

374
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,560
I’ll keep a hundred for fuel charging.

375
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,800
Who are you disgusting?

376
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,720
You think I’m a beggar?

377
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,840

Besides, the last experimental operation

Yes.

00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,760
How about this?

You bet on Jiang Haoyue

You bet on Qu Wei?

414
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,720
No.

415
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,480
Trust me.

416
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,800
I can explain.

417
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,720
What if it doesn’t work after I explain?

418
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,800
Anyway, trust me.

419
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,680
I’m on your side.

420
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,240
I’ll go see you for the review.

421
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,680

You always support him, don’t you?

426

Since I was born,

427
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,360
I’ve lost all bets.

428
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,920
So, I bet on Qu Wei this time.

429
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,720
He’s very likely to lose.

430
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,400
I have to bear disgrace for the moment.

431
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,920
It’s an awesome idea.

432
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,640
But now that we make a bet,

433
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,200
there should be a stake.

434
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,600
Or what if it doesn’t work?

435
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,560
What stake?

436
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,280
For example,

437
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,920
the loser shall promise something
to the winner.

438

441
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,800
How’s that possible?

442
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,920
I’ll never do that.

443
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,800
Besides, you’re likely to win, too.

444
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,520
I want you to win, then.

445
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,320

I promise you

469
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,880
I only review the paper for Grade 2.

470
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,480

524
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,880
Why did you steal that?

I had planned
to steal the paper of Grade 1.

526
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,280
But I was so nervous

527
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,760
that I took the paper of Grade 2.

528
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,560
Mr. Wen, he didn’t cheat.

529
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,280
When he tried to cheat, he cheated.

530
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:08,840

When writing a self-criticism,

538

your true feelings

539
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,240
are the most important.

540
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,720
Yes.

541
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,600
True feelings matter most
for the self-criticism.

542
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,200
You should reflect on your fault

543
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,840
from the bottom of your heart

544
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,200

548
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,960
I will not find any excuse

549
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,160
for my mistake.

550
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,640
It’ll only make me more ashamed.

551
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,840
I’ve realized the importance

552
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,360

What do you think?

561
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,680
Shall I write one for you?

562
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,160

for every thousand word.

564
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,600

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,720
because of my brother.

568
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,840
Shall I write it for you?

569
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,760
Don’t bother.

570
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,800
It’s not your fault.

571
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,320
I’m sorry

572
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,040
for having you involved.

573
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,400
Don’t do it ever again!

574
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,440
I won’t.

575
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,320
Lithium, sodium and potassium
want to lose an electron

576
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,280
so that outermost electrons
will become saturated.

577
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,880
So, they’re highly reductive.

578
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,320
Lithium, sodium and potassium...

579
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,560
Why is she asleep?

580
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,600
Fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine

581
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,240
are eager for an electron

582
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,040
so that outermost electrons
will become saturated.

583
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,640
So, they’re highly oxidative.

584
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,640
Miao,

585
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,240
send the soup to Jiang.

586
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,680
It helps to relieve the pain.

587
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,600
Smells great.

588
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,520
Doesn’t it?

589
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,000
Come on. Don’t rush to go.

590
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Don’t rush.

591
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Put this in it.

592
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,800
What’s this?

593
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,560
I...

594
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,000
I met a magic doctor in the market

595
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,400
and bought the aspidistra from him.

596
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:16,960
Got it?

597
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,520
I had planned to send it to my client,

598
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,280
but it was too expensive.

599
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,400
I kept some, then.

600
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,800
Let’s give it to Jiang.

601
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,360
Miao,

602
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,240
look at your mother.

603
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,360
She always trusts such stuff.

604
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,720
Aspidistra?

605
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,760
Last time, you bought
some Tonify Powder

606
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,800
for vitality nourishment.

607
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,720
Miao and I suffered from diarrhea
for two days.

608
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:31,960
But this is different.

609
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,120
I got this from a magic doctor.

610
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:33,880
You don’t understand at all.

611
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,200
What if it makes Jiang sick?

612
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,000
Come on. It’s for his own good.

613
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,520
You’ll make him sick.

614
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,480
Put it down.

615
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,120
Be quick.

616
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,160
Give it to Jiang.

617
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,440
But, you...

618
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,320
Listen.

619
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,480
Why don’t you let me put one in it?

620
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,600
Just put some in the soup.

621
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,960
He’ll go to the tryout.
What if he gets sick?

622
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,240
It’s raining so hard.

623
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,400
He must be feeling unwell.

624
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,080
How can he go to the tryout?

625
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,600
How I wish to beat you now!

626
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,240
Why don’t you trust me at all?

627
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,400
Let me have a try.

628
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,960
Don’t eat it before it’s cooked!

629
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,720
Are you an idiot?

630
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,520
Tastes like a date.

631
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,600
Bring my gratitude to your father.

632
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,480
Why is your face burning?

633
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,840
Are you having a fever?

634
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,840
I’m fine.

635
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,640
I don’t feel well on rainy days.

636
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,840
Hot water will make me better.

637
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,040
I’ll go buy some antipyretic for you.

638
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,840
Don’t.

639
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,080
What if I take the medicine

640
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,640
and feel sleepy during the tryout?

641
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,400
You make sense.

642
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,560
Here comes the bus. I gotta go.

643
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,760
Be careful on your way back.

644
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,800
Are you alright?

645
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,200
Yes.

646
00:34:31,245 --> 00:34:33,280
(Tryout for Olympic Chemistry)
For today’s experimental operation,

647
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,640
you have 90 minutes

648
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,720
to do the acid-base titration.

649
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,480
Two parts.

650
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,920
Titration for alkali

651
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,000
and titration for acid.

652
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,240
Three parallel experiments
for each part.

653
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,040
You may start.

654
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,520
When doing the acid-base titration,

655
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,200
you’ll be tested
on the pursuit of details.

656
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,520
The difficulty lies in

657
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,720
whether the leakage of burette
is fully inspected,

658
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,720
whether the bubbles
between the turncock and the glass ball

659
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,040
are discharged,

660
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,920
whether the burette is fully wetted

661
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,360
by depending liquid

662
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,280
and whether you’re calm enough

663
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,760
at the end of the experiment.

664
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,280
These are key points
for today’s contest.

665
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,640
Why are you pacing up and down?

666
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,080
You make me flustered.

667
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,280
It’s too much.

668
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,680
Jiang Haoyue defeated Qu Wei?

669
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,360
I can’t wait.

670
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,040
I’m going back to school.

671
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,520
I’ll go see him.

672
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,320
I’m leaving.

673
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,240
Let me drive you.

674
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,600
Don’t bother.

675
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,440
Stay at home for some rest.

676
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,040
Take the umbrella.

677
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,640
It’s raining.

678
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,320
All right.

679
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,800
Jiang Haoyue.

680
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,520
Mr. Bai said that

681
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,280
you were the only one
who made zero error?

682
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,200
I do the acid-base titration every week.

683
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,480
How many times have you done?

684
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,400
Why did you defeat me?

685
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,200
When the experiment started,

686
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,840
you felt so painful
that you couldn’t even hold the burette.

687
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,960
I practiced as many times as you.

688
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,000
Why must you pick Chemistry?

689
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,240
It offers the highest bonus.

690
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,280
Jiang Haoyue!

691
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,720
Now you can take some medicine, right?

692
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,640
How was the tryout?

693
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,200
It’s OK.

694
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,560
You tried your best.

695
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,720
You would have won
if you picked Physics.

696
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,080
And you’re sick today.

697
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,320
I shouldn’t think like that.

698
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,120
The result hasn’t come out yet.

699
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,480
I can’t give up hope.

700
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,440
Let me take you to a place.

701
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,800
God of the Sea, bless him.

702
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,320
Bless him.

703
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,800
God of the Sea, bless him.

704
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,440
What are you doing?

705
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,880
It’s for the God of the Sea.

706
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,960
You can’t eat it!

707
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,720
The God of the Sea doesn’t eat it.

708
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,320
How do you know?

709
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,920
What if he does?

710
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,440
We’re doomed.

711
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,600
Hope’s gone.

712
00:38:26,303 --> 00:38:27,063
Why don’t you eat one, too?

713
00:38:28,242 --> 00:38:29,242
No.

714
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,760
Qu Wei will feel prouder.

715
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,800
In fact, Qu Wei is a nice guy.

716
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,840
Besides,

717
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,360
I may not lose.

718
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,960
So, you won?

719
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,000
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

720
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,920
I needn’t have worried.

721
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,880
It proves that

722
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,680
I still lose every bet.

723
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,520
You’d better worry about yourself.

724
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,400
Will you eat it or not?

725
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,320
If you don’t, I’ll eat it.

726
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,880
I will. I didn’t decline.

727
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,360
Big number.

728
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,080
Small.

729
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,880
Here.

730
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,360
One more time!

731
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,480
You first.

732
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,480
All right.

733
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,120
Big.

734
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:36,760
Small!

735
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,480
You won again.

736
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,840
Would you like another try?

737
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,400
Why not?

738
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,200
Big or small?

739
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,400
Big.

740
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,040
Small.

741
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,840
It’s really a small number.

742
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,760
I quit! I quit!

743
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,880
This game doesn’t suit me!

744
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,640
If I knew, I wouldn’t have played.

745
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,360
I’ve lost

746
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,840
all my chocolate.
