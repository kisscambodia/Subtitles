Yes. But why does she look so weird?

32
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,960
I want dried bean curd.

33
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,160
And cabbage.

34
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:52,400
Hurry up.

35
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,000
There will be no seats.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,880
Rest assured.

37
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,720
My brother must’ve reserved one for me.

38
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,960
Hello, Daifei.

39
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,560
Hello.

40
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,600
Do you know each other?

41
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,440
Yes.

42
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,640
Good luck!

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,480
I’m sorry but it’s occupied.

44
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,040
I can’t stand up now.

45
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,600
My shoes...

46
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,520
I’m going somewhere else.

47
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,400
No!

48
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,720
If you leave,

49
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,920
I’ll be more embarrassed.

50
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,800
Please.

51
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,640
Is this your new friend?

52
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,920
I don’t know her.

53
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,560
Excuse me.

54
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,680
Please move away.

55
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,480
This is my seat.

56
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,120
How about you sit here?

57
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,120
Her sole is broken.

58
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,280
Her name is...

59
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,360
Daifei.

60
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,440
Daifei (Literally Empress)?

61
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,880
I am Empress Miao!

62
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,800
Jiang Haoyue.

63
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,560
Do you really think you are an emperor?

64
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,520
Sorry.

65
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,120
You misunderstood it.

66
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,880
My name is Daifei.

67
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,560
It literally means red flower.

68
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,280
How come someone has such a name?

69
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:05,960
Stop making a scene.

70
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,560
Just sit here.

71
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,680
Am I making a scene?

72
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,240
Alright.

73
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,200
She won’t leave.

74
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,120
I will.

75
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,200
Me too.

76
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,840
Thanks.

77
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,840
Are you still angry with Jiang Haoyue?

78
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,240
Don’t bring up that name.

79
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,360
You are quite possessive, huh?

80
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,600
Is it my fault?

81
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,880
Of course not.

82
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,040
That’s originally my seat.

83
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,440
How could he leave it to her?

84
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:45,960
Yes.

85
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,600
Jiang Haoyue went too far

86
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,920
this time.

87
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,280
He even affectionately
called her Daifei.

88
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,840
He never called me Miao that way.

89
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,000
It’s understandable for the first part.

90
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,960
But for the other,

91
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,680
it sounds like you are jealous.

92
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,360
Isn’t he your brother?

93
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,400
Could it be that you like him?

94
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,440
No way!

95
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,320
How could I like him?

96
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,040
It’s normal if you like him.

97
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,840
He ranks number one

98
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,280
in my heart.

99
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,960
That should be my question.

100
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,000
Do you like him?

101
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,920
Didn’t you say you don’t like him?

102
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,360
Why are you so nervous?

103
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,080
Let me calculate the intimacy index

104
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,480
for you two.

105
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,800
How?

106
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,960
Have you ever clasped hands with him?

107
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,840
Let’s get started.

108
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,160
I won!

109
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,120
Arm-wrestling.

110
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,480
Arm-wrestling isn’t hand-clasping.

111
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,600
Doesn’t it count?

112
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,840
That’s nothing about intimacy.

113
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,480
That’s absolutely confrontation.

114
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,080
Let me try another way.

115
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,720
Is there more?

116
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,840
Yes!

117
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,520
If you can look into his eyes

118
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,680
over ten seconds,

119
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,160
then you two are purely

120
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,440
siblings.

121
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,160
If you can’t...

122
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,520
Wait.

123
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:22,920
Wait.

124
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,840
It’s easy.

125
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,200
Looking into his eyes for ten seconds?

126
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,880
That’s quite easy.

127
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,360
You can have a try.

128
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,120
One.

129
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,520
Two.

130
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,000
Three.

131
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,560
Four.

132
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,040
Five.

133
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,320
Six.

134
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:34,720
Seven.

135
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,280
Eight.

136
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:35,600
Nine.

137
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,360
Ten.

138
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,800
Let’s go.

139
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,840
How about I hold it?

140
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,360
Let me hold it.

141
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,160
One.

142
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,160
Two.

143
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,360
Three.

144
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:09,840
Four.

145
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,840
Why didn’t you wake me up?

146
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,680
I meant to do it when we arrived.

147
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,480
How many stops to go?

148
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,680
Three.

149
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,600
Today in the canteen,

150
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,240
that girl’s sole was off.

151
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,840
So, she couldn’t walk.

152
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,040
Then why did you sit there?

153
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,400
She’d be embarrassed if I left.

154
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,000
Are you so considerate now?

155
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,040
Why are you so angry?

156
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,080
You shouldn’t do that anyway.

157
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,240
Here.

158
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,200
Your favorite chocolate.

159
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,600
Next time, I’ll leave

160
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,880
and you’ll sit there.

161
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,440
So beautiful!

162
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,440
It’s like a planet!

163
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,120
Look into his eyes for ten seconds.

164
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,520
Lu Miao. You can do it.

165
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,120
One.

166
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,760
Two.

167
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,680
Three.

168
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,880
Four.

169
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,200
Five.

170
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,520
This actress is so pretty.

171
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,160
Which actress is pretty?

172
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,440
Which one?

173
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,240
Miao.

174
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,200
Your mother was very pretty

175
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
when she was young.

176
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,200
Back in the school,
she had a well-known nickname.

177
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,760
What was it?

178
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,160
“Li Zi in Class 2”.

179
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,200
Really?

180
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,760
“Li Zi in Class 2”?

181
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,040
Who is Li Zi?

182
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,240
No kidding. It’s true.

183
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,920
All my classmates knew my nickname.

184
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,960
In the old days,

185
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,880
we liked watching Hong Kong movies.

186
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,560
All the girls

187
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,720
were given a Hong Kong nickname.

188
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,960
Like “North Street Joey Wong”.

189
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,800
“Western City Maggie Cheung”.

190
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,320
Because there were many beauties
in my class.

191
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,400
That’s why your dad

192
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,000
always went to my class.

193
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,240
I went to see you.

194
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,000
Save it.

195
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,640
Jiang.

196
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,560
Back then these belles were popular
nationwide.

197
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,160
Who do you think was the prettiest?

198
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,760
They were all good-looking.

199
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,000
Do you like all of them?

200
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,920
Playboy.

201
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,120
What are you doing?

202
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,080
Have you finished your homework?

203
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,520
I am correcting the answers.

204
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,920
You have my test paper.

205
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,840
Do you know

206
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,560
why the stars have different colors?

207
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,720
Because

208
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,200
stones have different kinds.

209
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,880
These stars. Not stones.

210
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,640
Why then?

211
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,960
Stars are different in color,

212
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,640
because their surface temperatures
differ.

213
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,760
Some stars give off white light

214
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,520
whose surface temperature

215
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,240
is up to

216
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,280
11.5 thousand degrees.

217
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,480
Some stars give off red light

218
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,800
whose surface temperature is

219
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,040
about 2,600 or 3,600 degrees.

220
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,400
Some stars give off blue light

221
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,800
whose surface temperature is

222
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,440
up to 25 thousand or 40 thousand.

223
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,800
What about the sun?

224
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,680
On the sun,

225
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,160
the surface temperature is
about 6 thousand degrees.

226
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,880
That’s why it looks yellow.

227
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,120
Mr. Genius.

228
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,880
May I ask you another question?

229
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,640
What kind of girls

230
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,000
do you like?

231
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,640
What is it to do with what I said?

232
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,520
I’m just curious.

233
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,680
Just tell me.

234
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,120
I like girls

235
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,440
with big eyes

236
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,160
and sweet smiles.

237
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,240
Big eyes.

238
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,880
Sweet smiles.

239
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,320
My name is Daifei.

240
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,600
It literally means red flower.

241
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,200
Doesn’t he mean Su Daifei?

242
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,720
Look at the poem you wrote!

243
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,280
“When shall we be trimming wicks again,

244
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,320
together the couple sit until dawn.”

245
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,280
Since the wick is trimmed off,

246
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,400
how can they sit until dawn?

247
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,440
Don’t laugh at me!

248
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,160
Give my test paper back!

249
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:31,720
No.

250
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,240
Give it back!

251
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,160
No.

252
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,360
Jiang Haoyue.

253
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,920
Give it back to me!

254
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,360
No.

255
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,040
My hair...

256
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,800
One.

257
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,640
Two.

258
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,800
Three.

259
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,400
Four.

260
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,920
Five.

261
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,440
Six.

262
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,120
Seven.

263
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,880
Don’t move.

264
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,680
Okay.

265
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,320
I’m going home.

266
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,320
Oh, no!

267
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,680
Do I really...?

268
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,600
One.

269
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,600
Two.

270
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,320
Three.

271
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,520
Four.

272
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,840
Five.

273
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,120
Oh, no!

274
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,040
I can’t even look at his photo.

275
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,600
You agreed to be friends with him

276
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,640
and he still rejected?

277
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,160
Who would be friends with him?

278
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,040
Did he really say that?

279
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,880
For Lu Miao?

280
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,920
That makes sense.

281
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,440
You don’t wear AJ6,

282
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,080
yet you wear Warrior shoes.

283
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,360
At the beginning,

284
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,920
I thought he’s Akagi Takenori.

285
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,040
Turns out he is Rukawa Kaede.

286
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,960
It’s not too late to know it now.

287
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,600
No.

288
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,880
I must let Miao stay away from him.

289
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,760
Can this thing

290
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,360
really make my eyes look bigger?

291
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,880
Trust me.

292
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,400
Come on.

293
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,000
Sorry.

294
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,520
Paper.

295
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,520
Why did you do these things lately?

296
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,800
You changed hairstyle

297
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,520
and learned makeup.

298
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,040
Is it because...?

299
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,400
Definitely not.

300
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,160
Hello, Panda.

301
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,360
Good cosplay.

302
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,280
Who did the makeup for you?

303
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:54,960
It’s hideous.

304
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,640
- None of your business!
- None of your business!

305
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,440
Look at my hairpin.

306
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,240
Fashionable, isn’t it?

307
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,280
As you please.

308
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,280
Girlish.

309
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,560
I’m so manly.

310
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,480
I can hold it.

311
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,440
Are you manly?

312
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,040
Now it looks better.

313
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,040
Take it as a gift.

314
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,200
No, I’ll buy one myself.

315
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,400
It’s fine. I have plenty.

316
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,200
Plenty?

317
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,560
Are you a girl?

318
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,600
Watch your tongue!

319
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,580
(Shi Che. Badmouthed - 10086)

320
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,120
Ziye. Don’t be angry.

321
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,880
Think about your motto.

322
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,040
Calm.

323
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,720
Science.

324
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,560
Rationality.

325
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,600
That’s it. Don’t be angry.

326
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,320
By the way,

327
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,720
did you get your answer
from the gaze?

328
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,840
No.

329
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,680
Gaze? What gaze?

330
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,920
I’ll buy you a drink after class.

331
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,440
Sir. Bill, please.

332
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,160
Okay.

333
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,040
Can you eat so much?

334
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,920
My treat.

335
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,320
Well.

336
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,040
What did Miao say to you just now?

337
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,640
Do you want to know?

338
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,600
Open it.

339
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,360
Watch your service attitude.

340
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,600
That’s more like it.

341
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,520
42.

342
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,920
42?

343
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,080
Do you know Skinship rules?

344
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,240
Skin and ship.

345
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,320
What?

346
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,880
You are really bad at study.

347
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,520
Have you ever held

348
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,000
a girl’s hand?

349
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,440
Great!

350
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,760
Yes.

351
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,000
How did you feel?

352
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,360
Very happy.

353
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,560
Have you ever

354
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,520
embraced a girl?

355
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,280
Did you hear that?

356
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,320
Our score is the highest now!

357
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,760
Yes.

358
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,400
Also very happy.

359
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,920
The last question.

360
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,960
Have you ever looked into her eyes?

361
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,480
Yes.

362
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,880
Who looked away first?

363
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:12,840
Me.

364
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,000
You

365
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
like that girl.

366
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,280
I...

367
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:22,880
I’m back to the classroom.

368
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,720
This is Skinship principle!

369
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,720
Big eyes.

370
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,200
Sweet smiles.

371
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,680
Daifei. Let’s go shopping later.

372
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,160
Looking closely,
her eyes are not that big.

373
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,720
Nuts!

374
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,520
Why is she gone?

375
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,240
Was that

376
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,240
indirect hand-holding?

377
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,240
Of course not.

378
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,400
Haoyue.

379
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,320
Do you find

380
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,400
anything different on me today?

381
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,080
Different?

382
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,240
Have you gained weight?

383
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,720
Have a close look.

384
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,240
A hairpin?

385
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,640
Is it beautiful?

386
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,480
Not very good.

387
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:41,880
Go.

388
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,760
Isn’t it too red?

389
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,600
If I apply this,

390
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,400
Director Yang would openly criticize me.

391
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,120
What color is this?

392
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,520
It looks too mature.

393
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,600
No.

394
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,200
It’s not for my age.

395
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,720
This looks good.

396
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,500
(Nanfeng No.1 High School)

397
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,760
We wear the same uniforms.

398
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,600
Why does it fit well
on the exercise leader?

399
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,240
They got their uniforms trimmed.

400
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,720
Really?

401
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,920
I’ll go trim it tonight.

402
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,560
Will you join me?

403
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,280
Yes.

404
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,280
Yours looks better.

405
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,560
Yours is good, too.

406
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,560
Thank you, sir.

407
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,520
We’re leaving.

408
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,800
- Goodbye.
- See you.

409
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,600
Goodbye.

410
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,560
Sir.

411
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,120
To trim your school uniform?

412
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,520
How did you know it?

413
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,560
You students

414
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,080
come to a tailor’s shop.

415
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,720
What else could it be

416
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,360
if not trimming school uniforms?

417
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,960
Is it your first time here?

418
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,720
Did you know it as well?

419
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,080
Students who come here
for the first time

420
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,320
all come with black plastic bags
like this.

421
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,120
Furtively.

422
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,640
Sir.

423
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,240
Those two girls’ uniforms

424
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,560
were gorgeous.

425
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,360
Could I trim it that way?

426
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,920
Make it short and shrink the waist.

427
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,240
Then your waist looks thin
and your legs long.

428
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,240
That will look great.

429
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,800
That makes sense.

430
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,400
I’ll make it shorter then.

431
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,360
To here.

432
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,560
Girl.

433
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,320
Wind will get in if it’s too short.

434
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,040
You’ll have a stomachache.

435
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,160
Really?

436
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,280
Alright.

437
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,080
Sir.

438
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,320
Is that white shirt

439
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,400
made by you?

440
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,200
Of course.

441
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,040
However,

442
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,560
it was customized for someone.

443
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,920
Is it costly?

444
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,800
No.

445
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,400
You look different today.

446
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,200
Let’s go.

447
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,320
You are in a good mood today.

448
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:22,880
Yes.

449
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,720
Is your uniform...?

450
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,120
Miao.

451
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,000
Shrunk from washing?

452
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,040
Miao.

453
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,280
I trimmed it short on purpose.

454
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,280
Jiang Haoyue.

455
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,680
Miao!

456
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,320
You look different today.

457
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,800
Thanks to your hairpin.

458
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,600
Is the hairpin from him?

459
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,400
Yes.

460
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,600
The same ones.

461
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,080
A good match, isn’t it?

462
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,000
Wait for me.

463
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,720
This is well crafted.

464
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,720
You can have it.

465
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,600
It’s nice of you.

466
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,040
Any problem?

467
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,080
No.

468
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,200
Speak.

469
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,240
I have a friend.

470
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,880
She suddenly

471
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,600
pays attention to her dressing.

472
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,200
Why is that?

473
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:25,880
Lu Miao?

474
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,240
Your friend

475
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,160
is either me or Lu Miao.

476
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,280
What else could it be?

477
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,520
She is into someone.

478
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,400
She gets along well

479
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,520
with her boy classmates.

480
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,560
Didn’t you give it to me?

481
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,560
I changed my mind.

482
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,680
Do you find out that

483
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,840
Miao has gotten pretty lately?

484
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,040
Why do you care about her so much?

485
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,640
No, that’s just how I feel.

486
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,400
You are overthinking.

487
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,520
She did all of that for me.

488
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,040
Have you noticed it?

489
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,360
Since she wore the hairpin I bought,

490
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,440
she’s been

491
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,640
dressing up all for me.

492
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,920
Does it ever come to you...?

493
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,000
No.

494
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,840
For Miao and me,

495
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,160
Jiang Haoyue is just a supporting role.

496
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,760
No. I mean...

497
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,360
Alright. Leading role.

498
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,680
Get back the trash can.

499
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,480
Sorry.

500
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,480
You are kinder.

501
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,040
Did you see

502
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,400
who knocked me?

503
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,760
Will you deduct his points?

504
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,080
Of course.

505
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,560
That’s a hit-and-run.

506
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,168
Your sister has a good figure.

507
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,880
Infuriated.

508
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,280
Trimming school uniforms isn’t allowed.
Do you know it?

509
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,200
I didn’t scribble on it.

510
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,720
I just changed the size.

511
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,400
Hi.

512
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,120
These are heavy.

513
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,200
Let me carry them in for you.

514
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,840
Thanks...

515
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,040
What’s your name?

516
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,320
Thanks...

517
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,000
You’ve thanked me.

518
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,800
Xie...

519
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,840
Xie Ziye.

520
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,720
My name is Xie Ziye.

521
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:37,960
Let’s go.

522
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,480
I think it’s beautiful.

523
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,720
It’s not.

524
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,240
What?

525
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,840
You should behave like a student.

526
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,960
Why do you learn from those bad guys?

527
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,560
It’s trending now.

528
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,800
People all get it trimmed.

529
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,160
Do you have to follow them?

530
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,120
You know nothing!

531
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,440
Jiang Haoyue!

532
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,080
You idiot!

533
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,240
You are heartless!

534
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,040
You fool!

535
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,480
You zombie!

536
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,600
You...!

537
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:27,720
Congcong.

538
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,600
He’s so clever.

539
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,640
How come he can’t understand
my feelings?

540
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,640
I just want to look good.

541
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,600
I’m sick of the sack-like uniform.

542
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,960
I want to be shiny. Can’t I?

543
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,600
I don’t care about others.

544
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,480
I just want his recognition.

545
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,840
Is it so hard?

546
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,380
(Chick Fortuneteller)

547
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,560
The uniform is shortened.

548
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,400
It’s true that I’ll easily get a cold.

549
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,760
I’d better wear my original clothes.

550
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,960
Can I have some fashionable hairpins?

551
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,240
Those inside are all new styles.

552
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,080
Thanks.

553
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,560
This is good.

554
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,920
I’ll buy it.

555
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,120
Sorry.

556
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,240
Jiang Haoyue.

557
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,360
It’s you!

558
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,400
I didn’t think you’d come here.

559
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,200
I’m just passing by.

560
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:40,880
I’m going.

561
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,680
What a coincidence.

562
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,680
Could you help me

563
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,400
pick a hairpin?

564
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,480
I can’t decide.

565
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,320
Yeah.

566
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,560
That’s the lowest price.

567
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,200
Mom.

568
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,640
Where is my uniform coat?

569
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,400
Yes.

570
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,520
No one else will offer you
a lower price.

571
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,080
Is it being washed?

572
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,760
Why didn’t you ride the bike today?

573
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,080
Nor did you.

574
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,240
- Yesterday...
- Yesterday...

575
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,080
After you.

576
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,920
I was too meddlesome yesterday.

577
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,840
Afterwards,

578
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,560
I will no longer meddle
in your business.

579
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,560
Good.

580
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,840
You...

581
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,040
What did you want to say just now?

582
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,760
I forgot.

583
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,960
You should behave like a student.

584
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,840
Look at what you wear!

585
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,880
How gaudy these are!

586
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,640
How should I explain it to your parents?

587
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,560
Go deal with them now!

588
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,360
Got it?

589
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,160
Go for classes.

590
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,640
Hello, Director Yang.

591
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,080
Why are you hiding your hands?

592
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,120
Get your hands out.

593
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,440
Your hands are not okay.

594
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,720
I’m gonna remove the polish.

595
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,720
How come he has this in his pocket?

596
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,400
Your hair is not okay either.

597
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,400
I’m tying it up now.

598
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,920
Tidy up your dress.

599
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,640
Go for classes.

600
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,960
Thank you, Director Yang.

601
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,640
Somebody said he wouldn’t
mind my business.

602
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,040
Take your school uniform.

603
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,360
My uniform will be dry tomorrow.

604
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,520
Wear it

605
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,680
for the morning exercise in a while.

606
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,360
Wear mine.

607
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,920
By the way,

608
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,880
where did you get this headrope?

609
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,080
I picked up on the road.

610
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,720
Did you?

611
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,640
It’s good on you.

612
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,840
Liar.

613
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,720
You said that

614
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,680
you fancy girls like Su Daifei.

615
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,160
When did I say I fancy her?

616
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,160
Didn’t you say that

617
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,640
you like girls

618
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,320
with big eyes and sweet smiles?

619
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,600
Also, she trimmed her uniform

620
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,640
and you didn’t say anything about that.

621
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,200
You have big eyes as well.

622
00:34:33,528 --> 00:34:35,248
Alright. Be good.

623
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,320
Go.

624
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,200
I stole my mom’s lipstick.

625
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,520
Can you help me make up?

626
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,360
Make up?

627
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,520
Why do you come to me?

628
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,800
Mom said pretty guys can make up.

629
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,040
But I’m a boy.

630
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,560
But you are pretty.

631
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:07,010
Come on. Try it.

632
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:07,960
Hurry.

633
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,800
Jiang Haoyue.

634
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,440
Come out! Stop hiding!

635
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,560
I know you’re inside!

636
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,040
Jiang Haoyue! Come out!

637
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,120
Come out or I won’t leave!

638
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,120
What are you drawing?

639
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,240
Nothing.

640
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,040
What’s in your hand?

641
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,760
Show me.

642
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,040
Nothing.

643
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,080
No.

644
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,000
Nothing.

645
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,160
Give me!

646
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,840
One.

647
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,240
Two.

648
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,160
Here you are.

649
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,360
Go home with me!

650
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,000
No!

651
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,440
You only scold me but not him!

652
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,840
