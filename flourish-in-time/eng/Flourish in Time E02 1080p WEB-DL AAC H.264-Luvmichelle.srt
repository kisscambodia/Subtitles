Jiang is waiting for you.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,800
I’m coming.

36
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,880
See you then.

37
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,160
Uncle Lu.

38
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,120
My artificial leg...

39
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,040
Thank you.

40
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,400
You’re welcome.

41
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,880
If anything comes up

42
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,280
in the future, just let me know.

43
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,640
This kind of thing can’t be held up.

44
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,280
It’s bad for your body.

45
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,760
Take care of yourself.

46
00:03:18,703 --> 00:03:23,020
(Own Uncle Lu 1,000 yuan
for repairing my artificial leg)

47
00:03:25,403 --> 00:03:26,880
I saw the ambulance.

48
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,360
It’s said that Jiang Haoyue
got beaten badly.

49
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:28,960
It’s reliable source.

50
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,160
Jiang Haoyue
had an excessive loss of blood,

51
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,960
he’s still in rescue.

52
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,600
Lu Miao was so violent.

53
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,640
How come she was there, too?

54
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,120
Their relationship is suspicious.

55
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,800
I heard they’re dating each other.

56
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,160
These rumors are outrageous.

57
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,640
What’s up?

58
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,880
What were you looking at?

59
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,320
Nothing.

60
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,440
I’m here alone

61
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,800
with snow falling down...

62
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,040
The bus’s here, let’s go.

63
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,200
Do you know

64
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,640
that Lu Miao from Class 10 of Grade 1

65
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,040
is Jiang Haoyue’s sister?

66
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,240
Sister?

67
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,000
How come they are siblings

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,160
but one’s last name is Lu,

69
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,920
the other is Jiang?

70
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,680
What a complicated relationship.

71
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,760
What happened to their family?

72
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,320
Yeah,

73
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,520
how could she be his sister?

74
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,960
It shouldn’t be this dramatic, right?

75
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,880
What kind of family is that?

76
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,920
She’s his half-sister.

77
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,400
Why does he like Lu Miao?

78
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,920
Have you heard...?

79
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,200
Lu Miao in our class

80
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,080
is the child bride of Jiang Haoyue.

81
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,440
Really?

82
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,800
However,

83
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
since Lu’s family

84
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,920
has declined afterwards.

85
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:39,800
So,

86
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,040
Jiang’s family wants
to abolish this marriage.

87
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,560
Enemies and lovers are destined to meet.

88
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,400
Where did you hear that from?

89
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,760
Don’t ask about where
the gossip comes from.

90
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,360
This is a golden rule, got it?

91
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,720
Anyway,

92
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,680
these two families are family feud.

93
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,360
Really?

94
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,320
Our families are enemies?

95
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,520
How come I don’t know that?

96
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,320
Well...

97
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,600
Is it true about the child bride?

98
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,120
What do you think?

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,160
It must be true.

100
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,960
It’s true.

101
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,000
She’s coming.

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,640
Excuse me, please.

103
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,320
Jiang Haoyue’s sister.

104
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,840
Here you are.

105
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,280
Take it.

106
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:39,840
Here.

107
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,000
This is my gift for you.

108
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,720
By the way,

109
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,960
I’m from Class 3 in the neighborhood.

110
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,520
Please pass this letter
to Jiang Haoyue for me.

111
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,600
What are you doing?

112
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,160
Here.

113
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,320
I want to be friend with you.

114
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
I’m just curious

115
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,000
about your childhood stories
with Jiang Haoyue.

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,120
Please don’t mind.

117
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,040
We only meant to be friends with you.

118
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,960
You are new

119
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,960
and unfamiliar with the school.

120
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,320
We can show you around.

121
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,480
Let’s go. Yeah.

122
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,800
Give somebody else a chance.

123
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,960
Give us some chances, too.

124
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,880
You stepped on my stuff.

125
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,720
Alright, sorry.

126
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,520
Miao,

127
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,080
what does your brother normally do?

128
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,520
What’s his preferences
on food and drinks?

129
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,280
When’s his birthday?

130
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,440
What’s his blood type?

131
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,640
If you want to talk about
Jiang Haoyue, go outside.

132
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,800
Don’t crowd here.

133
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,840
Her name is Lu Miao.

134
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,040
Her last name is not Jiang.

135
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,720
Let’s go.

136
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,360
Why’s she being so mean?

137
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,160
I know, right?

138
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,160
Thank you.

139
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,080
Feng Wanwan.

140
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,200
Yan Su.

141
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,480
Yan Su got so many votes.

142
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,880
Xie Ziye.

143
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,840
I voted for you.

144
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,840
Can you stop causing me trouble?

145
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,560
Who said that I want to
join the class committee?

146
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,880
But you pay attention to class

147
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,200
and you obey all the rules.

148
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,520
You are careful, your grades
are top-notch, too.

149
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,400
It’s obvious that the teachers like you.

150
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,640
What does it have anything to do

151
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,840
with me joining the class committee?

152
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,600
The mentioned students

153
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,080
are recommended by every one of you

154
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,160
after spending time with them.

155
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,360
As the head teacher,

156
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,320
I’ll choose the committee members
from them.

157
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,480
Class President,

158
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,440
Yan Su.

159
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,520
Vice Class President,

160
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,640
Feng Wanwan.

161
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,760
Study Representative,

162
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,000
Xie Ziye.

163
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,640
I voted for my deskmate for her
to be the class committee members.

164
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,760
It turned out that she doesn’t
want to do it.

165
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,480
How come anyone would refuse to do it?

166
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,280
Maybe she’s afraid of all the troubles.

167
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,840
What troubles would it bring to her?

168
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,240
Joining the committee
will have many duties.

169
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,440
They are all plain easy jobs which

170
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,200
would take up a lot of time.

171
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,400
It’s hard to tell

172
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,120
that Jiang Haoyue’s leg is artificial.

173
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,200
You can flip it and find out.

174
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,240
It may be a machine gun,

175
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,000
or a flamethrower.

176
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,080
Aren’t you guys finished yet?

177
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,080
Just focus on your snacks.

178
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,360
Let’s go.

179
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,760
Wait, who on earth are you?

180
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,800
Is it your business to mind?

181
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,840
He’s my brother.

182
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,800
Gossiping about him is my business.

183
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,840
Try and point again.

184
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,680
Let’s go.

185
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,200
Unreasonable.

186
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,040
Be careful, don’t hurt yourself.

187
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,800
Can we be a team?

188
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,200
Stretch your hand.

189
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,720
It’d be fine soon.

190
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,760
It won’t hurt if
you’ve stretched well.

191
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,600
I’m sorry about the

192
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,280
class committee that day.

193
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,640
I should’ve asked you about it.

194
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,680
I’m just afraid of all the troubles.

195
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,080
I know.

196
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,360
Being the committee member

197
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,560
means all kinds of duties.

198
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,560
They take you much time
and can’t exercise you.

199
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,400
You good students
aren’t fond of these things.

200
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,880
But I think you have strong ability,

201
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,680
you can help

202
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,000
students who fall behind like us.

203
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,240
It’d be nice.

204
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,600
A bug!

205
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,520
Don’t move.

206
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,160
It’d be fine now.

207
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,840
I’m always afraid of bugs.

208
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,400
Of course, because
your name represents leaf.

209
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,800
Thank you.

210
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,200
Ziye, let me add on QQ.

211
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,680
Let me scan your code.

212
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,480
Alright.

213
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,360
Okay.

214
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,520
I’ve sent you a friend request.

215
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,120
Okay, I’ve added you.

216
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,400
What’s this notebook for?

217
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,040
I keep scores on it.

218
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,360
For every guy I meet,

219
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,320
I’d evaluate them by rating.

220
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,560
Evaluate them?

221
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,040
Screening them by Big Data,

222
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,080
then choose the one who
got the highest overall score

223
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,920
as my Mr. Right,
then I’ll confess to him.

224
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,360
It works?

225
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,640
Sure.

226
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,040
This can keep me from dating

227
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,360
the wrong guy.

228
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,840
Very rational and scientific.

229
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,720
Well, who got the highest

230
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,160
score until now?

231
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,000
Jiang Haoyue.

232
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,360
How could it be him?

233
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,200
Great height.

234
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,080
High IQ.

235
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,080
Good-looking.

236
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,480
Though he’s a bit aloof,

237
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,240
giving others a sense of distance.

238
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,520
It makes me want to challenge more.

239
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,040
Plus,

240
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,000
he’s a bit of a sister-con.

241
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,440
Stop there, Miss Xie.

242
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,760
Clear your horrible imaginations.

243
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,480
These are not imaginations.

244
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,960
These are reasonable
speculations based on the facts.

245
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,200
With so many rules and restrains,

246
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,160
you’re just like a robot.

247
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,160
You’re full of energy every day,

248
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,000
you’re just like
a long endurance lithium battery.

249
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,760
We two can make a good match.

250
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,760
These are all for you.

251
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,160
They’re all yours now.

252
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,520
All mine?

253
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,800
How can I take them?

254
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,000
To Jiang Haoyue,

255
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,640
ever since we met
at the math competition,

256
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,880
I couldn’t forget
your elegant demeanor.

257
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,840
Hopefully to meet you
at the podium next time.

258
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,080
From Qu Qianqian,
Class 5 of Grade 2.

259
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,760
Can you quiet down?

260
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,720
These gifts represent
their regards for you.

261
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,240
I’ve taken the gifts.

262
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,160
I should bring them to you.

263
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,760
To Jiang Haoyue,

264
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,760
my name is Zhou Xiuyan

265
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,680
from Class 3 of Grade 1.

266
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,480
I’ve always admired you.

267
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,160
I’ve read all of your articles.

268
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,680
You are the most out-standing
person I’ve ever met.

269
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,240
I hope to know you better.

270
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,960
Zhou Xiuyan?

271
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,320
I heard she’s the prettiest girl

272
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,360
of the next class.

273
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,880
Not bad.

274
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,120
Boring.

275
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,840
You are the broken angel
fallen from heaven.

276
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,400
Icy eyes.

277
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,280
Fragile lashes.

278
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,560
Pale face.

279
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,320
Your tears run down silently.

280
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,000
A kiss from god on your forehead.

281
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,160
If you bear from any sufferings,

282
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,880
I’m willing to be your
most loyal listener.

283
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,000
If you can’t walk properly,

284
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,680
I’d be your walking stick by your side.

285
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,960
From Class 6 of Grade 1,

286
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,840
Zhang...

287
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,320
Zhang Xin?

288
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,920
Isn’t that a guy?

289
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,360
You are always alone.

290
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,000
But you are pretty popular
in the school.

291
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,040
I wrote the analysis
of the mistakes aside.

292
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,040
Correct them yourself

293
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,080
and finish the rest of the paper.

294
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,560
You are so strict.

295
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,860
(Disability is infectious.
Stay away from us!!)

296
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,200
I’ll go back first.

297
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,200
Take these with you.

298
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,600
I don’t want them.

299
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:37,920
Throw up in there,

300
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,040
not outside.

301
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,720
Are these from your classmates?

302
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,080
They are no use.

303
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,120
Throw them away.

304
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,760
When you were in kindergarten,

305
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,520
your teacher said to me

306
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,080
that,

307
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,800
as for your personality,

308
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,200
you need strict discipline,

309
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,600
or you may have troubles
in the future.

310
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,240
Then, I saw you

311
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,680
playing games with other kids,

312
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,240
he fell down and cried,

313
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,520
but you,

314
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:15,296
you ignored him standing right there.

315
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,560
I immediately understood .

316
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,200
Your personality

317
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,040
won’t cause you any trouble.

318
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,800
You are always like this.

319
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,240
No matter how nicely others treat you.

320
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,040
You’ll always stick to your minds,

321
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,960
isn’t it?

322
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,240
You won’t remember
anything others did for you.

323
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,560
It’s just like your mother.

324
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,240
A heart as cold as rock.

325
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,200
Then don’t trouble Uncle Lu anymore.

326
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,320
Tell me,

327
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,160
is it you?

328
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,800
Who are you?

329
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,360
Jiang Haoyue wouldn’t
stand out for himself

330
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,840
but crying behind your back.

331
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,560
Well?

332
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,640
Are you defending
your brother again?

333
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,480
What did you say?

334
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,520
Lu Miao!

335
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,960
I’ve been looking for you.

336
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,360
Let’s go.

337
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,720
Don’t stop me.

338
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,840
They went too far.

339
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,480
I’m giving them a lesson.

340
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,280
Come here.

341
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,560
There are two of them.

342
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,680
Can you handle them?

343
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,280
I’m not afraid of them at all.

344
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,800
Even if you are not,

345
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,600
what if this gets big and
the parents come over?

346
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,400
What if the school punish you?

347
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,040
But,

348
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,000
should I just

349
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,480
let them do whatever they want?

350
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,280
These losers will be punished one day.

351
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,880
I heard Wang Xinwen is
sort of a coward.

352
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,120
A new Switch?

353
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,640
Thanks to your help of cheating
in the last exam for me.

354
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,120
My parents are satisfied
with my results this time.

355
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,120
I’ll let you borrow it for a few days.

356
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,920
Really?

357
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,840
Look.

358
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,880
Mr. Lame is here.

359
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,040
A coward protected by a girl.

360
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,920
Handsome!

361
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,880
I’ll see you after school

362
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,960
in the Biology Classroom.

363
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,360
I want to talk to you.

364
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,040
Your biggest fan.

365
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,100
(Biology Specimen Room)

366
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,920
Why are you here, too?

367
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,720
I got a letter.

368
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,840
So did I.

369
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,880
Are we tricked?

370
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,960
Have you realized your fault?

371
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,000
I’m sorry.

372
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,960
Why are you sorry?

373
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,280
What are you sorry for?

374
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,120
I cheated in the exam.

375
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,200
Don’t tell that.

376
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,880
Come out, don’t be mysterious.

377
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,040
What else?

378
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,200
I shouldn’t read
Zhang Cheng’s love letter.

379
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,680
Isn’t there anything else?

380
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,560
Think about the things you said,

381
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,320
the words you wrote.

382
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,400
I shouldn’t mock Jiang Haoyue.

383
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,800
I warn you,

384
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,280
stop gossiping about Jiang Haoyue.

385
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,160
Otherwise,

386
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,840
you’ll be just like this.

387
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,320
So, it was you.

388
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,800
I tell you,

389
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,160
I’ll go to the teachers.

390
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,120
Hey, it hurts.

391
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,400
Are you going to the teachers?

392
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,000
No!

393
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,360
You win.

394
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,640
Stop looking at me.

395
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,960
You win.

396
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,240
Don’t worry, we won’t
tell the teachers.

397
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,520
Let’s go.

398
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,760
Look at their faces just now.

399
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,840
It feels so good.

400
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,080
I didn’t know you could
break an apple in half by hand.

401
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,400
I cut it in advance.

402
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,120
What a brilliant idea!

403
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,000
I thought you are only good
at studying.

404
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,360
You underestimated me.

405
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,780
(Time Book)

406
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,360
A lame

407
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,440
and a loser.

408
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,840
Jiang Haoyue and Lu Miao

409
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,360
no wonder are siblings.

410
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,720
Cheng,

411
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,480
just cut it off.

412
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,160
I don’t want to have anything
to do with Lu Miao.

413
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,040
How could you take it being bullied

414
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,120
by a girl?

415
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,440
I warn you, don’t mess with Lu Miao.

416
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,080
Or the whole school would know

417
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,160
that you cheated in the exam.

418
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,920
Who told you about that?

419
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,840
Yeah.

420
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,240
How dare you to accuse us of that?

421
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,680
A new Switch?

422
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,240
Thanks to your help of cheating
in the last exam for me.

423
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,320
My parents are satisfied
with my results this times.

424
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,920
I’ll let you borrow it for a few days.

425
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,760
Seriously.

426
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,720
Earlier,

427
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,320
it was our fault.

428
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,400
Please don’t tell others.

429
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,280
Yeah.

430
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,520
It was all our fault.

431
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,800
We apologize.

432
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,880
As long as you delete
the recording in your phone.

433
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,440
We’ll do everything you say

434
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,040
in the future.

435
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,360
What do you say?

436
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,560
Twenty sets of examination papers,

437
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,920
I’ll delete it right after you finish.

438
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,280
Twenty sets?

439
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,000
Let’s just do them.

440
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,240
We’ve scared them alright.

441
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,200
Wang Xinwen even confessed

442
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,200
about the love letter thing.

443
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,840
Me and Ziye decorated

444
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,840
the Biology Specimen Room
to a horrifying setting.

445
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,720
There were a lot of traps, too.

446
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,720
Like the spider web,

447
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,600
there’s a scary

448
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,760
panda mask, too.

449
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,320
Wang Xinwen wasn’t convinced earlier,

450
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,680
I grasped him down on the floor

451
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,800
right after.

452
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,040
He then apologized to me.

453
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,760
But I’ll not forgive him.

454
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,200
Lu Miao,

455
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,160
it’s not necessary.

456
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,960
You think you were incredible

457
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,240
being the hero out there.

458
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,720
I don’t need it.

459
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,280
I can’t stand them
talking about you like that.

460
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,520
Why would be angry?

461
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,560
Why bother revenging on them?

462
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,840
I surely know

463
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,920
what they’d say about me.

464
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,040
Mr. Lame.

465
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,240
A coward.

466
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,480
A loser.

467
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,720
All of these are facts.

468
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,120
Don’t say that!

469
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,800
You are not like that.

470
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,680
Then what am I like?

471
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,440
Do you remember when we were young?

472
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,480
We hung out together.

473
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,120
There was a boy

474
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,160
who threw a pine cone on you.

475
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,040
You threw back precisely at him

476
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,640
without thinking.

477
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,280
Ever since,

478
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,120
no kids in the neighborhood
would bully you again.

479
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,560
You are never timid.

480
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,000
You are neither a coward.

481
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,240
The disability of your body

482
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,800
won’t get in your way of being brave.

483
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,680
I didn’t know better when I was a kid.

484
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,120
You are killing me.

485
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,800
Lu Miao.

486
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,640
Lu Miao.

487
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,000
Can you stop stepping on my shadow?

488
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,360
It will stop me from growing tall.

489
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,000
There’s a place for spicy hot pot there.

490
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Let’s go.

491
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,200
I’m good.

492
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,240
I heard it’s a newly opened store.

493
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,200
The taste is especially fresh and spicy.

494
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,680
Two squids for free

495
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,040
if you buy three shashliks.

496
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,480
Let’s go then.

497
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,720
Lu Miao.

498
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,720
Can you

499
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,960
stop causing yourself troubles

500
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,960
for protecting me?

501
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,960
That’s not trouble.

502
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,080
There’s a saying

503
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,720
as “When the sky collapses,
it falls on the tall guys.”

504
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,880
You are short.

505
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,760
Stop troubling yourself.

506
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,120
Promise me.

507
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,120
Don’t ever say those
demoralizing things again.

508
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,840
Let’s go.

509
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,200
Uncle Hao.

510
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,000
I’m here to return the books.

511
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:16,800
Alright.

512
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,040
Do you still have the
ninth episode of Naruto?

513
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,800
Someone called Mr. Arrogance

514
00:24:21,843 --> 00:24:23,203
borrowed it a few days ago.

515
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,240
How about the tenth episode
of Slamdunk?

516
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,320
Borrowed by him as well.

517
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,240
And the nineteenth episode of One Piece?

518
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,240
Let me see.

519
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,040
Also borrowed by Mr. Arrogance.

520
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,320
Mr. Arrogance!

521
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,440
What’s the matter?

522
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,640
A guy called Mr. Arrogance

523
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,720
borrowed all the comic books

524
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,000
I want to read.

525
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,680
You sure have very similar tastes.

526
00:24:49,828 --> 00:24:50,188
Here.

527
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,600
Jiang.

528
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,960
I cooked some vegetables for you.

529
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,640
Look.

530
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,000
Broad beans.

531
00:24:57,437 --> 00:24:58,360
Fried shrimp with greens.

532
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,080
You know?

533
00:25:00,121 --> 00:25:02,765
I cooked this pork
and lucid ganoderma myself.

534
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,280
My friend gave me
a cup of ganoderma powders.

535
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,280
I used it all.

536
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,200
I heard it’s good for your brain.

537
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,880
It’s beneficial to you all.

538
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,280
Come and taste it.

539
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,120
Eat some.

540
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,040
Try.

541
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,920
It’s so good.

542
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,480
Did you wash your hands?

543
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,560
Sure I did.

544
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,600
You can’t use your hands.

545
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,280
Here.

546
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,600
Dip it in the oyster sauce

547
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,720
It must be good.

548
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,720
Must be so fresh.

549
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,080
Here.

550
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:31,720
Try it.

551
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,360
Dip it in it,

552
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:35,920
here.

553
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,600
Have a try.

554
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,280
Thank you, Aunt.

555
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,040
Try it.

556
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:47,720
Well?

557
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:48,960
Isn’t it good?

558
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,360
It’s so good.

559
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,800
I knew it.

560
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,520
Miao.

561
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:00,840
Have one, too.

562
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,160
It’s good for your brain.

563
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:03,480
Eat.

564
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,160
Eat.

565
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,280
If you like it,

566
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,960
I’ll cook some soup for you next week.

567
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,760
Some cordyceps flower soup.

568
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,280
Her grandparents brought me
a lot of cordyceps flowers.

569
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,720
We’ll use them to make soup next week.

570
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,800
You know, the pesticide effect
of cordyceps flower

571
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,240
is as effective
as the cordyceps sinensis.

572
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,160
Aunt,

573
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,720
I’m going away for training next week.

574
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,600
You want to escape from it?

575
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,480
I’ll save some for you

576
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:23,920
to eat when you’re back.

577
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,960
You must try it.

578
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,600
Yeah, she’ll save you some.

579
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,680
Not cool, man.

580
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,600
Your aunt is so nice to you.

581
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,560
What’s the training for?

582
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,040
It’s for the chemistry competition.

583
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,640
Aren’t you good at physics?

584
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,960
The chemistry competition
offers higher bonus.

585
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:38,960
OK.

586
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,200
Miao,

587
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,200
when can you attend a competition, too?

588
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,960
Win a reward or something

589
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,760
to cheer me up.

590
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,200
I’ve won places in the

591
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,200
swimming competition, okay?

592
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,000
Did I mean sport competition?

593
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,880
Don’t interrupt.

594
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,080
What’s wrong with sport competition?

595
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,920
Look at Liu Xiang and

596
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,520
Yao Ming.

597
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,400
They are stars,

598
00:26:59,400 --> 00:26:59,600
aren’t they?

599
00:26:59,600 --> 00:26:59,920
Right.

600
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,800
My dad knows me better.

601
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:06,720
Eat.

602
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,640
Eating cannot stop you from talking.

603
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,400
Jiang,

604
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,400
please pay more attention

605
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,960
to Miao’s studying.

606
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,640
Keep an eye on her for me.

607
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,320
She’s too careless.

608
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,600
Here.

609
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,240
Eat some pork.

610
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,640
Nothing for her.

611
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,160
All yours.

612
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,160
Eat some more.

613
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,280
You are leaving next week.

614
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,920
Then, my math,

615
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,640
English,

616
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,080
chemistry

617
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:33,600
and physics

618
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,560
have the possibility

619
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,080
of failing completely.

620
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,280
Your grades

621
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,880
can’t get any worse.

622
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,840
What’s the difference between
the last one

623
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,400
and the fifth-worst?

624
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,960
Don’t look down on me.

625
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,720
This time,

626
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,600
I’ll keep my place of the fifth-worst.

627
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,320
However,

628
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,080
which subject should I start
to work on first?

629
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,000
I got it.

630
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,360
I’ll ask Cong.

631
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,640
Cong who’s got hidden mysterious power.

632
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,240
Show me your true power.

633
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,520
Tell Lu Miao

634
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,000
which subject to start first.

635
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:32,680
Which one?

636
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,200
Math.

637
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,040
Cong who’s got hidden
mysterious power...

638
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,720
Alright.

639
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,040
I think it’s pretty accurate.

640
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,760
You think so?

641
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,720
How about I

642
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,720
let Cong to tell your fortune?

643
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,160
Why do I need it?

644
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,840
Why not?

645
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,240
Aren’t you going out next week?

646
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,440
Just do it to know

647
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,320
if it’ll be good or ill luck.

648
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,240
I’m good.

649
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,440
Just try.

650
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:14,960
Hurry and take it.

651
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,720
Just throw them into it.

652
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,720
Just, like this.

653
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,520
Cong who’s got hidden mysterious power.

654
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,880
Where did you get the tokens?

655
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,720
When you were not around,

656
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,600
Cong has made many vital

657
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,520
decisions in my life.

658
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,720
Cong who’s got hidden mysterious power.

659
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,680
Show me your true power.

660
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,720
Tell me

661
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,800
if Jiang could

662
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,680
defeat his opponents this time.

663
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,360
Do we have it?

664
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,600
Show me.

665
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,840
A changing world,
a critical opponent coming.

666
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,680
It’s an unlucky token.

667
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,680
Oh, no,

668
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,840
you’ll meet a rival.

669
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,520
You’ve received higher education.

670
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:12,960
Why do you believe in this?

671
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:14,760
Well,

672
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,040
Einstein said

673
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,040
that the end of science is metaphysics.

674
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,480
Einstein never said that.

675
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:23,960
I’m going back.

676
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,120
Wait for me.

677
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,400
Take this.

678
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,720
This can bless you with good fortune.

679
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,620
(Koi Fish By Side)

680
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:44,840
It’s not necessary.

681
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,120
Keep it yourself

682
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,520
to bless you a satisfying math grade.

683
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:49,880
I mean it,

684
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,680
it can bless you for sure.

685
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,480
Take it.

686
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,040
You keep it.

687
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,520
This really works!

688
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,200
Haoyue.

689
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,920
Pay attention to the details
during exam.

690
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,960
Read the paper carefully.

691
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,920
I’m going.

692
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:07,840
Alright.

693
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,440
Good luck.

694
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,480
Good luck.

695
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,840
She’s really determined.

696
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,040
Guys.

697
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,720
Guys.

698
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,160
A new student came to our class today,

699
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:40,960
let me introduce him.

700
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,120
Hello, everyone.

701
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,280
Hello, guys.

702
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,520
My name is Shi Che.

703
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,680
Che, you finally came.

704
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,120
He’s kind of cute.

705
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,440
Naruto!

706
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,720
It’s you.

707
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,960
Do we know each other?

708
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,280
Sit over there.

709
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:08,920
Alright.

710
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,960
Here, let’s begin the class.

711
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,080
Alright, guys.

712
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,240
Turn to page 10 of your book.

713
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,360
Look at the blackboard.

714
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,120
What’s her name?

715
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,680
Lu Miao.

716
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,960
Why?

717
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,760
Are you interested in her?

718
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,280
Nonsense.

719
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,760
Jiang Haoyue,

720
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,320
look what I got.

721
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,120
Look at this.

722
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,480
Isn’t it pretty?

723
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,480
Lu Miao.

724
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,920
I have it, too.

725
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:01,800
Very pretty, right?

726
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,680
It took me so long to get this.

727
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,160
Take it, Jiang Haoyue!

728
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,240
What are you doing?

729
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,760
Sorry.

730
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,280
I didn’t know he’d miss it.

731
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,600
Sit further next time you’re out.

732
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,200
Don’t get hit by anything again.

733
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,720
Why can’t you dodge from it
though you missed it?

734
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,800
Save it.

735
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,200
You did it deliberately!

736
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,880
How could you know?

737
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,960
Do you have proof?

738
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,480
You...

739
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,800
You are a bully!

740
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,240
Jiang Haoyue, what are you doing?

741
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,520
Sorry.

742
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,720
Didn’t mean it.

743
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,120
You loser!

744
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,280
You are a loser.

745
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,360
