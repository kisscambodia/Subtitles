(Grades of Qualification Trials
of Chemistry Competition)

31
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,900
No wonder that’s Jiang Haoyue.

32
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,640
It’s his first time of attending
a chemistry competition

33
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,600
and he won the first place.

34
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,720
Yeah.

35
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,400
I didn’t expect him to defeat Qu Wei.

36
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,280
Jiang Haoyue is really good.

37
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,320
He’s alright.

38
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,120
Jiang Haoyue.

39
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,712
Congratulations for winning
the first place.

40
00:02:05,712 --> 00:02:06,903
Are they Jiang Haoyue

41
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,080
and Qu Wei?

42
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,520
Thank you for the notes.

43
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,920
I took you easily this time.

44
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,040
Next time,

45
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:15,960
I won’t lose.

46
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:18,920
Bring it on.

47
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,880
I thought it would be
a fierce competition.

48
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,440
But this is kind of touching.

49
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,240
Who’d know

50
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,240
the good students have got
the competitive spirit?

51
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,560
After this,

52
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,120
Jiang Haoyue would receive
more female fans.

53
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,920
My chance is even smaller.

54
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,920
What are you talking about?

55
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,160
Jiang Haoyue

56
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,920
does have a little bit of charm.

57
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,760
But he’s only a secondary character

58
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,080
compared to me and Meng.

59
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,560
A secondary character?

60
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:45,600
Yeah.

61
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,200
Thanks to him.

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,760
Or I wouldn’t have

63
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,040
the bet with Meng.

64
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,920
This is a good chance

65
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,800
for me and Meng to bound.

66
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,480
However,

67
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,800
I don’t think Jiang Haoyue
is easy to handle.

68
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,800
The good students are
never easy to deal with.

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,640
Well, if that’s the case,

70
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,760
I’ll take the initiative,

71
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,520
forestall my enemy.

72
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,880
When the priest climbs a foot,

73
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,960
the devil climbs ten.

74
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,680
I’ll make him be like a fool.

75
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,920
He’s not my match.

76
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,600
My brother won this time.

77
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,480
So what?

78
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,400
As long as Qu Wei wins the

79
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,600
National Chemistry Competition again,

80
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,000
he’d still be recommended
for admission to school.

81
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,000
Do you like Qu Wei?

82
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,240
Who said that?

83
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,960
Then why are you being disappointed?

84
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,600
Five points deducted.

85
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,200
Don’t touch my notebook!

86
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,360
Didn’t you say to be fair and square?

87
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,040
Deduct the points when you have to.

88
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,720
You deducted too many points.

89
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,400
Who’s the No.1

90
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,400
in your notebook now?

91
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,760
Jiang Haoyue.

92
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,800
You know, you have such a good taste.

93
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,000
My brother is the best.

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,280
He’s a winning bet.

95
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,640
Can you stop it?

96
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,360
Hum.

97
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,080
Sorry.

98
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,200
He stepped on you.

99
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:36,920
That’s alright.

100
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,480
It’s inconvenient
for my brother to take a bus.

101
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,400
I need a solution for him.

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,520
Excuse me.

103
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,320
Okay.

104
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,160
I got it.

105
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,600
I’ll be right back.

106
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,760
Please wait for a while.

107
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,560
Stop right here!

108
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,280
Shh.

109
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,120
Quiet down.

110
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,160
Don’t you know

111
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,040
that this bike is the treasure
of your mom?

112
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,440
Don’t touch her bike.

113
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,240
If it got scratched or anything,

114
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,400
she may kill you.

115
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,840
Nobody knows it except for us.

116
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,560
As long you keep the secret,

117
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,640
Mom will never know.

118
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,280
I can’t agree.

119
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,960
It’s a huge responsibility.

120
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,880
I have to tell your mom.

121
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,480
Dad!

122
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,120
Alright.

123
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,320
How come you want
to ride a bike now?

124
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,640
The bus is too crowded.

125
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,800
It’s not convenient for Jiang Haoyue.

126
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,680
I want to carry him to school every day.

127
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,960
Are you able to carry him?

128
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,640
How about...?

129
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,880
No.

130
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,320
This doesn’t work.

131
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,680
Dad.

132
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,080
No.

133
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,880
Here.

134
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,680
Come on.

135
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,360
Hold tight.

136
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,440
Use your feet!

137
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,840
Dad, I seem to get
some inspiration now.

138
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,240
Try to let go of your feet.

139
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,200
Don’t panic.

140
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,040
Try to let them go.

141
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,560
I did.

142
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,440
Slow down.

143
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,200
Hold tight.

144
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,560
Miao,

145
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,160
are you okay?

146
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,880
Are your feet okay?

147
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,240
I’m fine.

148
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,880
You’re really okay?

149
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,480
Yeah, I’m fine.

150
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,200
The bike!

151
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,640
Hurry!

152
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,040
What should we do?

153
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,520
The handlebar is tilted, too.

154
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:44,960
How to deal with it?

155
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,200
What to do?

156
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,000
It’s fine.

157
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Dad, let’s try again.

158
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,040
Try again?!

159
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,640
Do you know what this bike
means to your mom?

160
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,760
It’s her treasure.

161
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,600
She adores this bike more than me.

162
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,520
Dad, it’s fine.

163
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,480
Only a titled handlebar.

164
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,440
Just fix it.

165
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,240
Fix it?

166
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,200
I’m taking this to get fixed
for your mom.

167
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,520
Dad, let’s try again.

168
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,800
One last time.

169
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,600
I promise.

170
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,520
No way.

171
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,160
I’m telling you.

172
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,960
This is not negotiable.

173
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,960
You fell down when carrying me.

174
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,000
It’s fine for me.

175
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,280
What if it’s Jiang Haoyue?

176
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,440
What if his legs got hurt?

177
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,240
Alright.

178
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,760
How about this?

179
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,560
I’ll make more time

180
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,880
to drive you to school.

181
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,680
Is that alright?

182
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,120
Oh my gosh.

183
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,280
The back of it is broken.

184
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,960
Dad, I’ll try another round

185
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,640
to see if it’s broken.

186
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,640
Stop riding it.

187
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:40,920
Come on.

188
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,680
See, Dad!

189
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,000
It’s fine.

190
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,240
Dad, see you.

191
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,160
Come back, you silly girl.

192
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,503
I’ll go home later for dinner.

193
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,520
Congratulations, Meng.

194
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,440
You don’t say.

195
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,760
You bet on Qu Wei to win.

196
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,920
But Qu Wei lost.

197
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,000
Thank you.

198
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,400
I lost this bet.

199
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,560
What do you want me to do?

200
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,520
If you win,

201
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,480
what would you want me to do?

202
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,360
If I win,

203
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,720
I want you

204
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,240
to ride a bike with me.

205
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:16,960
Okay.

206
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,040
That’s it.

207
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,920
Riding a bike.

208
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,080
I can ride with you, Miao.

209
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,640
Now you know my ability.

210
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,480
I can be your teacher

211
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,360
and teach you to ride.

212
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,120
Think about it.

213
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,160
Teacher!

214
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,520
That’s right.

215
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,760
What are you doing?

216
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,840
Taking the initiative and
surprising her is my plan.

217
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,360
Why did you teach her to ride?

218
00:08:50,484 --> 00:08:51,365
Go away.

219
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:52,800
Copy that.

220
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,240
I suddenly remember
I’ve got things to do.

221
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,560
I’ll teach you another time.

222
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,160
But I...

223
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,880
How should...?

224
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,760
Goodbye, my student.

225
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,440
Teacher!

226
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,280
Guoguo only knows the tricks of riding.

227
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,480
I could teach you how to ride it
properly.

228
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,720
Come and get on.

229
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,240
You know how to ride?

230
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,280
I’m just bad at riding while
carrying someone else.

231
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,600
So,

232
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,240
you only learn to carry another person?

233
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,000
Why don’t you ask Chlorophyll
tomorrow?

234
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,680
She’s lighter.

235
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,680
No,

236
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,240
it has to be you.

237
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,360
I didn’t know that I mean
so much to you.

238
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,840
It’s only because your weight

239
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,400
is closer to my brother’s.

240
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,240
So you are learning just
to carry Jiang Haoyue?

241
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,680
Don’t tell others.

242
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,640
Keep this secret for me.

243
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,320
I want to surprise him.

244
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,440
You guys

245
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,000
are so close.

246
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,840
If you have a partner
who’s accompanied you

247
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,280
since childhood,

248
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,280
you’d do the same.

249
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,440
It’s just like...

250
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,400
Me and Guoguo?

251
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,760
I think so.

252
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,440
Qu Wei.

253
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,680
Can I borrow your bike

254
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,240
some other day?

255
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,040
My bike?

256
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,200
Forget it if it’s not okay.

257
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,680
It’s fine.

258
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,640
Take it.

259
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,560
Thank you.

260
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,480
But can your legs

261
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,040
ride a bike?

262
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,440
The doctor said it’s fine.

263
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,760
How come you want to learn
riding now?

264
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,920
Is it because of Lu Miao?

265
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,440
No.

266
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,280
It’s just a guess.

267
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,760
Feel free to ride my bike.

268
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,640
Where

269
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,840
do you know this much?

270
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
You are my opponent.

271
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,080
I know everything about you.

272
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,200
Wait.

273
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,640
It’s too hard for you
to ride while carrying me.

274
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,680
Let’s do it another way.

275
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,440
You ride it first,

276
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,320
then I’ll hop on.

277
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,160
No.

278
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,040
Jiang Haoyue can’t run.

279
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,080
We need to guarantee his safety.

280
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,560
His safety matters the most.

281
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,720
But your legs don’t have enough
power now.

282
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,480
I’ll train to get better.

283
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,720
How to improve my leg strength?

284
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
We can only

285
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,840
start from the basic training.

286
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,440
Are you sure

287
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,240
that this would work?

288
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,280
Firm Stance

289
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,680
can practice the strength
of our leg muscle.

290
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,840
It makes our muscle to gain
more endurance.

291
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,480
Meng,

292
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,360
should we take a break?

293
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,720
I thought it’s fifteen minutes.

294
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,400
Five minutes left.

295
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,120
Though Firm Stance is practical,

296
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,360
do it according to your ability.

297
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
You go take a break.

298
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,440
I have to finish the last five minutes.

299
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,200
I need to finish this.

300
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,960
Then I’ll be a whole new person.

301
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,800
No wonder you are Lu Meng!

302
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,920
You are really determined.

303
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,600
I figured it out.

304
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,680
The core should be at point B.

305
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
No,

306
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,800
it has to be at point A.

307
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,080
Take the road in consideration, too.

308
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,000
Let me see.

309
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,560
See for yourself.

310
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,360
Try it.

311
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,280
Me?

312
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:35,960
Yeah.

313
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,480
Hope you could succeed for one take.

314
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,760
Are you okay?

315
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,560
I’m fine.

316
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,800
Seems like

317
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,560
we need to calculate it accurately.

318
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,040
Not all problems

319
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,560
can be solved by accurate calculation.

320
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,920
Riding requires multiple exercises.

321
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,000
To make your body be used
and adapted to it

322
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,400
is more important.

323
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,600
That’s true.

324
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,680
Well...

325
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,160
Do you have any good solutions?

326
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,000
What’s this?

327
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,480
Training wheels, in case you fall down.

328
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,960
I don’t need them.

329
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,600
Remove them.

330
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,120
We’re only practicing.

331
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,120
Don’t be shy about it.

332
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,800
Remove them.

333
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,160
I told you to do what you can.

334
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,200
Your legs will hurt more tomorrow.

335
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,000
Remember to stretch them
when you go back.

336
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,640
I just want to carry him
as early as possible.

337
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,200
Jiang Haoyue is so lucky.

338
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,560
Let me be your brother, too.

339
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,720
You are not as lucky.

340
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,240
Jiang Haoyue,

341
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,120
you came back.

342
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:06,760
Hello.

343
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,581
What are you doing?

344
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,480
You are...

345
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,800
Aunt, I’m her...

346
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,360
Her classmate, right?

347
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,080
Yeah.

348
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,440
I’ve been teaching her to ride lately.

349
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,240
Have you had dinner?

350
00:15:18,746 --> 00:15:20,560
Not yet, I’m a bit hungry, too.

351
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,080
Take your classmate home for dinner.

352
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,609
Thank you so much.

353
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,200
I thought it was you.

354
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,760
Come on, let’s go.

355
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,760
Go home.

356
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,360
Here, try it.

357
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,840
This is my specially-made
braised pork with brown sauce.

358
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,520
See, this is a nice piece.

359
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,080
Thank you.

360
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,320
I only made this one dish.

361
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,200
Have a try.

362
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,880
Okay, thank you.

363
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,920
My mom’s braised pork with brown sauce

364
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,640
is one of the best in the neighborhood.

365
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,840
You are embarrassing me.

366
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,320
It’s slightly better than the others.

367
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,000
Wait a second.

368
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,720
Jiang,

369
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,520
here.

370
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:53,880
Thank you, Uncle.

371
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,760
You have one, too.

372
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,000
This is not too salty.

373
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,800
Thank you both for dinner.

374
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,480
Thank you so much.

375
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,640
Your classmate is so sensible.

376
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,120
You really don’t have to
be so affected.

377
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,640
Why don’t you introduce him
to your father?

378
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,120
Shi Che, he sits behind me.

379
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,320
He knows Jiang Haoyue, too.

380
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,680
Nice to meet you.

381
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:16,800
You too.

382
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,680
Have some more.

383
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,840
Well,

384
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,280
please take care of Miao more.

385
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,420
She’s bad at studying.

386
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,400
His grades are worse than mine.

387
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,600
Shi Che is popular among the students.

388
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,760
His dream is joining
the school basketball team.

389
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,520
He dyed his hair red a while ago.

390
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,520
Right?

391
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,120
Yeah.

392
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,200
I think his red hair

393
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,240
was pretty cool.

394
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,560
Young people nowadays
are pretty stylish.

395
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,840
Jiang, here.

396
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,440
Thank you, Uncle Lu.

397
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,320
Eat.

398
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,960
It’s the best ever.

399
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,320
It’s so good, Aunt.

400
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,600
Eat more if you like it.

401
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,960
Shi,

402
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,400
it’s getting late.

403
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,200
How will you go home later?

404
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,040
I’ll send him...

405
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,520
It’s fine.

406
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,880
I’ll send him home.

407
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,520
Alright.

408
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,400
Have some more.

409
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,400
In my perspective,

410
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,120
except for being good at studying
for a bit,

411
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,000
there’s nothing else special about you.

412
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,400
Why is Meng being so nice to you?

413
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,760
She gets along well with you, too.

414
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,200
It’s because she needs something
from me.

415
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,160
You’re good at riding a bike.

416
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,080
Surely I am.

417
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,720
Takumi Fujiwara of the Yushui
Northern Street is my nickname.

418
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,040
What’s your method?

419
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,720
Why do you ask?

420
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,680
Do you want

421
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,240
to learn riding?

422
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,800
Don’t!

423
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,160
Lu Miao learned riding
because she wants to carry you.

424
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,800
What kind of thing would it be
if you’ve learned it?

425
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,360
She learns riding to carry me?

426
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,160
I promised Lu Miao
to keep this as a secret.

427
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,680
If you learn riding,

428
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,280
it’d be disappointing Lu Miao’s efforts.

429
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,640
I got it.

430
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,440
I’m only walking you here today.

431
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:58,960
I’m going back.

432
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,120
Why do I feel like I’ve

433
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,720
made a huge mistake?

434
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,000
When is he coming?

435
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,080
Soon.

436
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,080
He doesn’t work far from home.

437
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,760
I have to take him today.

438
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,280
Today’s the Mid-Autumn Festival.

439
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,640
Jiang and Miao are waiting for
us at home for dinner.

440
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,840
Of course I know today’s a festival.

441
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:31,880
Or else why would I came

442
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,120
to send the moon cakes for my client?

443
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,600
Alright.

444
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,400
I need to put my client first

445
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,320
especially on festivals.

446
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,680
No client, no performance.

447
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,520
Without sales performance,

448
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,280
we would have no money.

449
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,680
No money,

450
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,120
no smile for me.

451
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,960
No smile means that...

452
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,680
Here he comes.

453
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,560
Be careful.

454
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,840
Manager Liu,

455
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,360
I’m...

456
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,720
You are...?

457
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,520
It’s me,

458
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,360
Lin.

459
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,320
Lin from the Publicity Department,
right?

460
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,920
No, I’m from the Sales Department.

461
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,240
The Television Selling Department.

462
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:04,960
I sell televisions.

463
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,120
Today’s the Mid-Autumn Festival.

464
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,440
I’m here to send you some moon cakes.

465
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,400
That’s not necessary.

466
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,240
There’s no other meaning.

467
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:11,680
There’s no need for that.

468
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,440
It’s just some moon cakes.

469
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,640
Don’t overthink about it.

470
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,840
Manager Liu.

471
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,800
Change it.

472
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,200
Change it.

473
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,720
Why are you looking at me? Change it.

474
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,360
Let me do it for you.

475
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,000
Don’t kick me.

476
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,080
What is this?

477
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,280
Nothing is right.

478
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,200
Gang up on me, huh?

479
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,120
Do you

480
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,120
still have money left?

481
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,800
No.

482
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,640
It can’t be.

483
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,240
Your teacher called to inform

484
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,680
me about you winning a prize.

485
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,600
I used it all to pay the fees.

486
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,920
Didn’t your mom give you
any money during the festival?

487
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,640
She’s so unreliable.

488
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,040
You aren’t qualified to judge her.

489
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,360
Then who is?

490
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,720
Lu Yongfei, right?

491
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,280
Listen up,

492
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,920
go to Lu Yongfei
whenever you need food!

493
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,540
(Haoyue, you called for me?)

494
00:22:50,543 --> 00:22:52,020
(Are you busy now?)

495
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,860
(I’m going out.
Have you had dinner?)

496
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,260
(Not yet. I’ll eat later.)

497
00:22:55,687 --> 00:22:57,740
(Eat meals on time.
Take care of yourself.)

498
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,260
(Yeah. Okay.)

499
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,980
(Your little brother is sick.
I need to go now.)

500
00:23:12,084 --> 00:23:13,284
Jiang Haoyue,

501
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,160
why are you sitting here alone?

502
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,080
You take Congcong out
for a walk every day.

503
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,120
Isn’t it tired?

504
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,560
It had gained weight.

505
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,600
It needs to lose weight.

506
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,920
Your watch is pretty.

507
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,280
How come it’s a bit familiar?

508
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,160
It can’t be.

509
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,920
Wait, let me see it again.

510
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,080
Where have I seen it?

511
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,120
Where have I seen it?

512
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,800
It’s Aunt Chen’s watch.

513
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,200
No, it’s not.

514
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,160
Yeah, it is.

515
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,240
I used to hide the chocolate
in your room.

516
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,880
I found an iron box.

517
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,280
There’s a picture of Aunt Chen

518
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,360
hidden inside it.

519
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,920
That’s the watch she was wearing
in the photo.

520
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,520
Who allowed you to open the box?

521
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,720
I’m sorry.

522
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,720
I didn’t know that box matters so much.

523
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,640
Please don’t be mad.

524
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,040
Before I touch your things,

525
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,560
I’ll definitely tell you next time.

526
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:04,920
It doesn’t matter.

527
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,000
Then why are you so upset?

528
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,040
Lu Miao.

529
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,080
Yes.

530
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,920
Are you a child?

531
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,600
You weren’t honest first.

532
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,320
It’s so obvious that you miss Aunt Chen,

533
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,960
but you pretend not to.

534
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,440
I don’t.

535
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,960
My mom is always busy
during the festivals.

536
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,520
But my dad always accompanies her.

537
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,200
They are not by my side,

538
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,920
but,

539
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,000
I wouldn’t think it’s because
they don’t love me anymore.

540
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,000
Because they’re working hard

541
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,560
for our life.

542
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,520
So,

543
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,600
even though Aunt Chen isn’t
by your side.

544
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,440
I believe her love

545
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,920
for you wouldn’t be less

546
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,400
due to the distance.

547
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,000
Really?

548
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,480
Of course.

549
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,560
Is that all for your dinner?

550
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,160
Today’s the Mid-Autumn Festival.

551
00:27:34,412 --> 00:27:34,953
Let’s go.

552
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,153
Let’s go have dinner at my home.

553
00:27:36,396 --> 00:27:36,884
Let’s go.

554
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,840
Collect your things.

555
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,560
Let’s go, Congcong.

556
00:27:42,025 --> 00:27:42,637
Let’s go.

557
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,200
My cooking is so good.

558
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,240
Come and try them sometime.

559
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,280
How many times have I told you?

560
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,040
I’m just...

561
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,080
Yeah, you know...

562
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,520
I’m calling to ask

563
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,920
about my bonus.

564
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,440
Did I pass the evaluation?

565
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,520
It’s hard to get the bonus.

566
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,600
Our family has a new TV.

567
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,760
But I didn’t pass last month.

568
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,600
It’s a deal, okay?

569
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,480
Miao.

570
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,040
Your mom bought the TV
using her own money

571
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,040
just for the selling performance.

572
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,840
Don’t ask about it.

573
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,200
I’ll do it better next time.

574
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,680
Okay, it’s a deal then.

575
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,000
Okay, it’s settled.

576
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,560
You came, Jiang.

577
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,200
Aunt, Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

578
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,560
You too.

579
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,600
You see the TV, right?

580
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,720
It’s just a little too big.

581
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,600
Big TVs provide better experience.

582
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,400
Yeah,
it’s just like we’re in the cinema.

583
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,080
Really?

584
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,600
As long as you like it,

585
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,480
my money is well-spent.

586
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,120
It’s a lot of money though.

587
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,760
It’s burning!

588
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,240
Why didn’t you watch it for me?

589
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:52,760
Change your shoes.

590
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,960
Turn the oven off. Hurry.

591
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,520
Do you know how to cook?

592
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,920
Not too bad.

593
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,760
Mom,

594
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,200
what are you cooking?

595
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,200
It’s a secret.

596
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,120
Let me help you.

597
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,000
Hurry up. I can’t hold it any longer.

598
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,680
Let me.

599
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,520
Alright, it’s done.

600
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,840
Fried tomatoes with moon cakes.

601
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,040
Can tomatoes be cooked with...?

602
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,240
What’s wrong?

603
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,160
It’s brand new, right?

604
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,000
You know,

605
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,120
this is a masterpiece created

606
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,120
by your mom’s lifetime skills.

607
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,400
Leave it.

608
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,440
Let’s try this first.

609
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,720
I’ve researched for a long time.

610
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,200
You know what?

611
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,240
I thought about it many times.

612
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,640
I think this combination

613
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,800
would be...

614
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,840
would be very delicious.

615
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,520
Miao, try it.

616
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:37,920
Here, Miao.

617
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,240
Try the moon cakes.

618
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,600
You too.

619
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,080
Here, help yourself.

620
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,400
Don’t always think for your daughter.

621
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,680
You should eat, too.

622
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,800
Everybody, come on.

623
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,680
Help yourself.

624
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,120
Eat it.

625
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,880
Alright.

626
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,000
Well?

627
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,840
It’s good.

628
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,040
It’s so good.

629
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,640
Very tasty.

630
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,840
It’s the best!

631
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,200
Very delicious.

632
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,080
It’s so good.

633
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,200
Why don’t you look like you’re
enjoying it?

634
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,240
Try it.

635
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,520
Too much salt.

636
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,000
The last time

637
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,080
when my mom cooked

638
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,600
fried shredded green pepper,

639
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,000
she said the exact thing, right?

640
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,320
She said it’s delicious, too.

641
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,840
Turn it down. Don’t let her hear that.

642
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,720
How can moon cake be fried?

643
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,640
Mom’s coming.

644
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,880
I think,

645
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,960
since this is salty,

646
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,680
adding vinegar

647
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,440
would be a solution for this problem.

648
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,880
I agree.

649
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,640
Vinegar can fix the problem.

650
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,040
Well, we start with just a little.

651
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,960
Sour and sweet, what a combination.

652
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,600
Mom, isn’t it so great?

653
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,800
Are you alright, my wife?

654
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,840
Mom, have some more.

655
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,600
Eat it.

656
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,560
Everybody gets some vinegar.

657
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,040
Hold it.

658
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,200
Hold it and ride.

659
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,320
Slow down, one more time.

660
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,280
Is that alright?

661
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,720
Hop on.

662
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,520
I’m beginning.

663
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,880
Right side!

664
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,840
Right!

665
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:02,840
Keep it steady.

666
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,600
Hold onto it.

667
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,960
Hold on.

668
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,440
Did you hop on?

669
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,880
You’ve learned fast.

670
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,520
Hop on!

671
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,040
Are you sure?

672
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,760
I’m sure.

673
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,520
But you just learned this.

674
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:17,800
I’m fine.

675
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,560
Are you sure?

676
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:26,880
Let’s go.

677
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,140
(Congcong’s mom)

678
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,280
I’m downstairs at your house.

679
00:33:13,068 --> 00:33:15,508
A message from the breeze says
that the moon in the autumn is pretty.

680
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,640
Let’s go, Jiang.

681
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,720
Let me take you for a ride.

682
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,120
Am I riding fast?

683
00:33:22,993 --> 00:33:23,713
Yeah.

684
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,200
Am I riding steadily?

685
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:26,680
Yeah.

686
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,760
Then, I’m going faster!

687
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,640
Hold me tight.

688
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,080
Is it steady?

689
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,840
Yeah.

690
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,880
Let me carry you to school
and back tomorrow.

691
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,760
You learned it for me?

692
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,520
Yeah.

693
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,360
I practiced it for so long.

694
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,080
Did the practice take long?

695
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,080
Yeah.

696
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,640
Then, we can ride to school

697
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,920
together every day.

698
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,400
Black Pearl, full speed ahead!

699
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,720
Let’s go!

700
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,080
Jiang Haoyue, time for school.

701
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,120
Jiang Haoyue.

702
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,280
I’m here.

703
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,200
Is this...?

704
00:34:17,287 --> 00:34:18,447
For me?

705
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,960
Aunt Fang’s bike is too high.

706
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,560
It doesn’t suit you.

707
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,560
But,

708
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,560
if I ride this bike,

709
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,040
I can’t carry you with me.

710
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,880
We are getting late for school.

711
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,280
Wait for me.

712
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,480
You can ride!

713
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,640
When did you learn it?

714
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,520
How come I don’t know?

715
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,000
Is there anything else
that you kept from me?

716
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,440
There are many.

717
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,880
Haoyue, have some more.

718
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,840
It seems he likes the eggs.

719
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,640
Then eat some more.

720
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,520
Here,

721
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,280
Miao.

722
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,600
Keep your eye on the bowl
when eating.

723
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,200
Don’t look around.

724
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,160
Eat.

725
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,920
Dad, why don’t I have it?

726
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,640
What?

727
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,320
A leg just like his.

728
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,760
You scared me.

729
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,800
The rice is on my face.

730
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,200
What’s wrong with me?

731
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,760
What did I say?

732
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,480
She’s just a kid.

733
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,720
Don’t be so strict with her.

734
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,520
Your dad’s arm is uncomfortable.

735
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,223
Is the food okay for you?

736
00:35:57,278 --> 00:35:59,798
Can you handle spicy food?

737
00:35:59,831 --> 00:36:00,391
Yes.

738
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,200
Chili and sour potato.

739
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,240
I’m so good at cooking.

740
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,120
It tastes like mustard.

741
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,760
Don’t eat it.

742
00:36:10,222 --> 00:36:11,382
Here.

743
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,440
Eat some meat.

744
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,640
Thank you, Aunt.

745
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,200
Mom,

746
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,120
how come you only pick food
for him not me?

747
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,280
How about me?

748
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,280
His...

749
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,200
Your bowl is full already.

750
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,360
No, you see,

751
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,600
you can still see the rice.

752
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,160
Look at his,

753
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:24,960
you can’t see the rice anymore.

754
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,720
I didn’t fill his bowl with
that much rice.

755
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,680
Well, here you are.

756
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,680
That’s right.

757
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:54,640
There are 215 bones in a man’s body.

758
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,560
But you only broke one.

759
