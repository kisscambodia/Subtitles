Jiang Haoyue learned cycling skills,

31
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,462
and you only gave him two extra points?

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,560
What?

33
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,160
You gave him two points?

34
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,400
You should have given him more points.

35
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,240
Make it four.

36
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,840
No, don’t do it.

37
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,200
Chlorophyll.

38
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,000
I’m with you this time.

39
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,720
No four points.

40
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,240
But it’s harder for him to learn this.

41
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,240
He had to put in more effort than

42
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,760
ordinary people.

43
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,440
So when it comes to cycling,

44
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,680
he should have the highest score.

45
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,320
Indeed.

46
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,360
But if I add four points to him,

47
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,480
Jiang Haoyue will have a perfect score.

48
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,720
Then I’ll have to confess
my love to him.

49
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,760
Then you should give him the points.

50
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,920
Give him two points then.

51
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,581
In fact, it’s not that hard

52
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,320
for a guy like him to finish a job.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,920
Add two points.

54
00:02:40,137 --> 00:02:42,040
I was going to

55
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,120
impress Meng,

56
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,080
but I didn’t expect
Jiang Haoyue could do it.

57
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,440
No way.

58
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,520
I have to think of another way
to get back in the game.

Sir.

62
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,720
Mr. Hao, where do you want me to put it?

63
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,200
Leave it there.

64
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,840
Okay.

65
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,640
Bye then.

66
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,440
OK. See you.

The team that wins
the first place in the game

69
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,640
will get a pair of
Hanamichi Sakuragi AJ6 shoes.

70
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,840
Yes! Lucky me!

71
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,040
Are you going to…?

72
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,800
Guoguo.

73
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,760
Do you think it’s cool if a man wins

74
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,400
a pair of AJ6

75
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,360
by strength?

76
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,640
Yes, cool.

77
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,440
Alright!

7 p.m.

80
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,440
I’ll wait for you.

81
00:03:57,812 --> 00:03:58,840
You go first.

82
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,200
See you then.

83
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,760
What a coincidence, Meng.

84
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,240
Why haven’t you left yet?

85
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,920
I’m waiting for Guoguo.

86
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,120
Where is your brother?

87
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,800
Their class has a quiz today.

88
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,560
It ends at 7 p.m.

89
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,360
I’m going back first.

90
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,040
Oh, bummer.

91
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,160
Let’s go back together then.

92
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,880
We got the same way.

93
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,920
Don’t you want to wait for Guoguo?

94
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,360
It comes to me that his teacher
is running over the lesson time.

95
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,440
Why don’t we go together?

96
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,520
I’ll go with you to get your bike.

97
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:50,840
Let’s go.

98
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,560
Let’s go.

99
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,280
Your brother can ride a bike,

100
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,160
Didn’t you practice for nothing?

101
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,440
Not for nothing.

102
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,400
Let’s race.

103
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,920
Let’s see who can ride faster.

104
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,840
I’ll count to three.

105
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,920
Okay.

106
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,680
Ready?

107
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,560
Three!

108
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
You can’t do that.

109
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,880
It’s not against the rule.

110
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,320
You can’t win even if
you play tricks.

111
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,960
Shi Che, you’re riding the wrong way.

112
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,920
That’s not the way home.

113
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,760
It’s the way
I’ve specially prepared for you.

114
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,680
Wait for me!

115
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,800
Shi Che! Wait for me!

116
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,720
You won.

117
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,040
I’ll take you somewhere later.

118
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,160
These shoes seem to be

119
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,120
Sakuragi Hanamichi’s
first pair of basketball shoes.

120
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,840
That’s right.

121
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,960
Haruko Akagi bought them with him.

122
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,640
Yes.

123
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,120
And I remember in the cartoon,

124
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,720
he only spent thirty yen.

125
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,040
In reality, it should be
more than a thousand yuan.

126
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,280
So expensive.

127
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,880
So it’s true that there
are 300 layers of

128
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,440
bulletproof glass between
the reality and the cartoon.

129
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,000
Do you want to shoot through the glass?

130
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,880
Are you

131
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,160
going to

132
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,360
rob the shoes?

133
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,960
How can you think of me like that?

134
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,520
If you team up for the game

135
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,160
and get first place,
you can get this pair of AJ6.

136
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,800
First place isn’t easy to get.

137
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,560
It’s hard for other people,

138
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,320
but not for me.

139
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,120
How come?

140
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,000
Excuse me,

141
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,560
but I rank number one in solo

142
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,160
in this community.

143
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,680
You’re good.

144
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,160
But this game needs a duo.

145
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,320
I need a partner.

146
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,120
Meng, before I dominate
the country in basketball,

147
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,400
help me win a pair of shoes.

148
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,520
What do you think?

149
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,520
OK!

150
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,520
It’s a deal.

151
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,240
Done!

152
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:14,760
You’re finally here.

153
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,240
Why are you here?

154
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,040
You want to win the shoes, right?

155
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,880
Don’t worry, I won’t hold you back.

156
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,880
I came to practice right after school.

157
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,280
Hurry.

158
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,720
Miao, you’re here too.

159
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,680
You’ve found a partner already?

160
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,120
I… I haven’t.

161
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,440
What?

162
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,880
Aren’t we the best partners?

163
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,120
It’s okay.

164
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,240
Why don’t you two fight it out?

165
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,280
It’s not necessary.

166
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,480
I don’t have to participate in this.

167
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,040
Miao.

168
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,680
You think you can defeat me?

169
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,480
I’ll try.

170
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,680
But I never played this game before.

171
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,440
It’s okay. Use my ID.

172
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
Don’t say I’m bullying you.

173
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,980
(READY)

174
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:14,900
(GO)

175
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,000
Guoguo, excuse me.

176
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,680
This doesn’t make sense.

177
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,920
The most important thing
in athletics is talent.

178
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,880
What is more important
than talent is determination.

179
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,760
I believe that,

180
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,960
with time,

181
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,120
you’ll be very good at

182
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,960
this game.

183
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,080
It’s alright.

184
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,040
I can let Guoguo have this chance.

185
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,680
Let me?

186
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,800
Miao.

187
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,040
That’s a bit too insulting.

188
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,240
You lost.

189
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,320
See you later.

190
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,320
I will definitely come back.

191
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
Meng.

192
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,640
Do you see it?

193
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:40,920
I do.

194
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,960
Guoguo looks

195
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,520
so sad.

196
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,400
Not him.

197
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,480
I’m talking about that pair of AJ6.

198
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,160
It’s already engraved with my name.

199
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,360
Here.

200
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,960
No, thank you. Let’s go.

201
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,000
Seriously?

202
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,600
You just finished your exams
and you’re still reading?

203
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,320
You should know that,

204
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,200
only with a combination of work
and rest can you surpass me.

205
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,080
What’s wrong?

206
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,080
Isn’t that your sister?

207
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,000
Don’t you want to say hello?

208
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,280
It’s not necessary.

209
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,760
Didn’t you just refuse to eat?

210
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,840
I want to eat now.

211
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,200
Alright.

212
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,720
No problem.

213
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,760
Why so angry?

214
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,560
The universal formula includes
trigonometric functions,

215
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,280
inverse trigonometric functions, etc.

216
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,480
The universal formula can

217
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,360
convert all trigonometric functions

218
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,200
into polynomials of tan(a/2),

219
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,760
and convert sinα, cosα, and tanα.

220
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,040
We call it

221
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,378
the universal substitution formula.

222
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,280
Lu Miao.

223
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,960
Now I’ll ask someone to come here

224
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,200
and review the use of this formula.

225
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,640
Stand up!

226
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,000
Class is over?

227
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,880
What are you laughing at?

228
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,040
Can you solve all the questions?

229
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,280
You two go out and sober up.

230
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,740
(Class 10, Grade 1)

231
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,720
I’m afraid we’re both going

232
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,200
to be on Ms. Lei’s blacklist.

233
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,000
Relax.

234
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,480
With our math scores,

235
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,800
we’re already on that list.

236
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,320
Don’t worry about this time now.

237
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,760
Don’t put us together.

238
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,600
I passed math test at least.

239
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,920
The difference between us

240
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,200
is just that
between 50th place and 100th place.

241
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,760
It’s okay.

242
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,560
How’s your game practice going?

243
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,600
Better than before.

244
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,360
Left, right, left.

245
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,360
Right, left, right.

246
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,520
Left, right, left.

247
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,080
Right, left, right.

248
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,960
Okay, that’s a progress.

249
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,520
Okay, follow me.

250
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,760
Why is your sister standing outside?

251
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,840
Okay, good.

252
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,920
I felt good today.

253
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,480
I never missed

254
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,520
a three-point shot.

255
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,160
Nice.

256
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,120
Let’s go get some drinks.

257
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,040
Looking for Lu Miao?

258
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,440
I’m looking for you.

259
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,400
Me?

260
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,880
I’ll go buy drinks first.

261
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,520
Wait for me.

262
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,080
I’ll be right there.

263
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,560
What is it?

264
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,760
Let me ask you.

265
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,160
Are you still studying?

266
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,760
No,

267
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,000
I’m not interested in studying.

268
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,840
I prefer to play basketball.

269
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,880
Why do you come to school
if you don’t study?

270
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,480
What does it matter to you

271
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,760
if I come to school or not?

272
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:49,840
You’re right.

273
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,360
I have nothing to do with it.

274
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,840
But let me remind you.

275
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,160
It’s fine if you don’t study,

276
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,000
but don’t affect Lu Miao.

277
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,080
Such a good student.

278
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,200
Don’t you think that’s lame?

279
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,800
School is a place for you to study,

280
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,480
but for me it’s a place to make friends.

281
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,960
Lu Miao, she has the right to study.

282
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,880
She also has the right
to make friends, right?

283
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,760
Besides,

284
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,840
even if you really are her brother,

285
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,240
you don’t have the right
to control so much, right?

286
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,280
She will withdraw from the competition.

287
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,160
Then we’ll see.

288
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,040
Che, what are you doing?

289
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,200
Do you think Meng will stand me up?

290
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,520
Why are you worried about that
all of a sudden?

291
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,840
Jiang Haoyue is jealous of
my relationship with Meng.

292
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,520
He’s trying to get in the way.

293
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,560
Although I’m not afraid,

294
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,000
you know

295
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,400
those straight-A students

296
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,160
are cunning creatures.

297
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,720
Better an open enemy

298
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,120
than a false friend.

299
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,800
I think you’re overthinking.

300
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,280
Meng.

301
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,200
Miao.

302
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,000
Why are you here?

303
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,480
I came to buy something to drink.

304
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,640
I’m thirsty too.

305
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,440
Then I’ll treat you.

306
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,200
Stop.

307
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,480
Either of you can buy it.

308
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,480
I’d like a coke.

309
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,200
What about you?

310
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,440
Two cans, thanks.

311
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:45,840
What are you doing?

312
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,400
Such a great opportunity.

313
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,400
Say what you want to say.

314
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,480
Ask whatever you want to ask.

315
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,400
Hurry up. Don’t be a coward!

316
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,000
What are you two muttering about?

317
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,000
Nothing.

318
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,680
Che wants to ask you something.

319
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,280
No.

320
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,120
I haven’t asked yet.

321
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,360
Two cans of coke
and you want to buy me off?

322
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,040
I won’t help you with your homework.

323
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,720
Who asked you for that?

324
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,800
You’re not even better than me.

325
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,080
I might as well do it myself.

326
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,680
Do you despise me?

327
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,920
No.

328
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,040
I admire you,

329
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,480
otherwise I wouldn’t have asked you

330
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,440
to join my team.

331
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,880
It’s nothing.

332
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,440
Meng.

333
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,760
I used our accounts to sign up
for the competition.

334
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,360
If you quit in the middle of the race,

335
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,000
I’ll be done.

336
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,080
Don’t worry, since I promised you,

337
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,960
I will do

338
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,200
my best.

339
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,440
Good friend.

340
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,400
Lu Miao.

341
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,040
I’m coming.

342
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,400
Why is he here?

343
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,920
He’s been waiting

344
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,880
for me to buy the drinks.

345
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,000
I’ll leave now.

346
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,880
Thank you for these.

347
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,560
It’s okay.

348
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,800
Don’t be mad.

349
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,920
Two bottles of drinks. Don’t mind it.

350
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,960
Why don’t we have some spicy hot pot

351
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,840
before we go back?

352
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,960
The owner is having a promotion.

353
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,280
30% off for students.

354
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,240
You don’t want it?

355
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,120
Then we can go next time.

356
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,560
Today Mr. Wen asked me

357
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,800
to answer a question about time zones.

358
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,720
I used the method you taught me.

359
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,040
He even praised me.

360
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,080
What is wrong with you?

361
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,680
Why did you go to
the arcade with Shi Che?

362
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,920
How did you know…?

363
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,120
I’m trying to help Shi Che win the game
to get the basketball shoes.

364
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,920
We’re good friends.

365
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,190
What’s wrong with me helping him out?
Besides…

366
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,760
Is being punished in class
also some kind of help?

367
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,440
You also saw that?

368
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,320
Can you not tell my parents?

369
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,840
You should quit the game.

370
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,160
Don’t waste time on

371
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,240
these meaningless things.

372
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,040
I can’t.

373
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,160
This is not a meaningless matter.

374
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,520
Since I promised Shi Che,

375
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,840
I have to be loyal.

376
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,600
A man’s word is his bond.

377
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,080
Besides, the competition
will be over soon,

378
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,320
so I won’t miss too much studying.

379
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,600
Being punished in class is also loyalty?

380
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,200
Where are you going?

381
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,960
Don’t follow me.

382
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,640
Fine! Whatever.

383
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,800
So cold.

384
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,960
Even if he doesn’t want to see me,

385
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,720
how can he refuse the spicy hot pot?

386
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,200
It’s so good

387
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,280
and 30% off.

388
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,600
It is really a loss not to try it.

389
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:54,800
Meng.

390
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,600
Why are you eating here alone?

391
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,040
It’s sad.

392
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,280
Spicy hot pot is better
when you eat alone.

393
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,720
If you like the crowd, go eat hot pot.

394
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,040
Why are you so angry?

395
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,360
Why Jiang Haoyue is not with you?

396
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,200
You’re deliberately trying
to piss me off, right?

397
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,280
Why would I?

398
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,760
You...

399
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,680
What is going on?

400
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,360
Jiang Haoyue wanted me to withdraw
from the competition.

401
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,520
He said it would affect my studies.

402
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,640
I’m confused.

403
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,600
He’s not your parent

404
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,880
or your class teacher,

405
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,720
why is he so meddlesome?

406
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,800
That’s right.

407
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,840
If you say yes,

408
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,720
that’s too inferior.

409
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,240
Of course no!

410
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,640
What did you say?

411
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,960
When I was little, I respected him

412
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,920
because he was a good student.

413
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,480
I was so humble

414
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,440
and obedient to him.

415
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,040
Today he got angry with me
only because of this,

416
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,600
so why should I
listen to him on everything?

417
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,280
So you mean,

418
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,800
you

419
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,760
chose me and rejected him?

420
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,400
Yeah!

421
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,000
Didn’t I promise you?

422
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,520
I was right about you!

423
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,320
Meng.

424
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,360
For sake of our friendship,

425
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,640
let’s drink this vinegar.

426
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,280
Cheers!

427
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,160
Cheers!

428
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,320
Don’t you feel sour?

429
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,800
It’s sweet.

430
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,800
So sweet.

431
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,840
Your taste is quite unique.

432
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,760
Now that I think back,

433
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,160
I should not have let Jiang Haoyue

434
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,040
control me so much.

435
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,840
You didn’t see it.

436
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,200
Today, his back to ride away

437
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,600
was really ruthless and decisive.

438
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,320
You can’t always defer to him.

439
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,720
He would get arrogant.

440
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,960
He’s taking it too far.

441
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,800
You can’t say that.

442
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,960
It’s true that we shouldn’t

443
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,360
miss studying because of practice.

444
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,560
But we have to spend time on practice

445
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,920
in order to place in the competition.

446
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,800
Right?

447
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,200
Come to think of it,

448
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,240
Jiang Haoyue’s controlling me
seems to be for my own good.

449
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,400
Just think about his cold back

450
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,680
when he left.

451
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,000
Yeah.

452
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,320
He learned to ride a bike

453
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,600
so he could go to school with me.

454
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,400
Meng.

455
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,640
You don’t have to push yourself so hard.

456
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,040
I don’t.

457
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,480
He must have put up with more every time

458
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,040
he taught me how to do my homework.

459
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,720
Meng, I…

460
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,400
I think you’re the cutest
when you’re angry.

461
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:34,880
Nonsense.

462
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,880
I’m always cute.

463
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,240
Bye. I’m going home.

464
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,120
I’ll walk you home.

465
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,800
No need, my home is just around here.

466
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,520
This restaurant is offering
30% off today.

467
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,834
Eat before you leave.

468
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:49,554
Let me eat spicy hot pot alone?

469
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,880
It’s sad.

470
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,320
Spicy hot pot is better
when you eat alone.

471
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:54,960
Bye.

472
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:55,920
I…

473
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,080
Can you turn off
the sound effects for me?

474
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,120
Turn off the sound effects, right?

475
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,480
Yes.

476
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,280
Thank you.

477
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:54,680
Done.

478
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:37,600
Ziye.

479
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,360
In class today,

480
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,240
Ms. Lei talked about
the universal formula.

481
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,480
What does it mean?

482
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,360
What’s with your sudden enthusiasm

483
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,920
for learning?

484
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,840
When I was punished for standing

485
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,880
in math class today,
Jiang Haoyue saw it.

486
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,560
He’s mad.

487
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,640
He still hasn’t spoken to me.

488
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,680
What are you gonna do?

489
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,000
I gotta go. My mom is here.

490
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,040
Were you talking to Haoyue on the phone?

491
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,160
He’s not home, right?

492
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,040
I wanted to bring him some fruit.

493
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,720
I knocked and no one answered the door.

494
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,560
He’s not back yet?

495
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,628
(When are you coming back?)

496
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,500
(Jiang)

497
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,080
Where are you?

498
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,840
Why aren’t you back yet?

499
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,200
My mom is worried sick.

500
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,080
I’ll be right back.

501
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,280
Don’t worry.

502
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:45,760
Well…

503
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,360
Are you still mad at me?

504
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,920
No, I’m not.

505
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,760
I’ll be home soon.

506
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,720
Okay.

507
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,400
When you get back, tell me.

508
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,160
I’ll bring you some fruit.

509
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,720
Okay.

510
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,960
The universal formula.

511
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,880
What are you calculating here?

512
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,480
Which question is to
determine the combos?

513
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,480
I see.

514
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,280
You are trying to help Lu Miao again.

515
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,680
Instead of studying me,

516
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,560
why don’t you do a few more questions?

517
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,040
You lost the weekly test again.

518
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,280
It’s still a B.

519
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,520
You were a D before,

520
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,520
so you’re much better than before.

521
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,800
But if I am a B,

522
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,040
I can’t help you win the shoes.

523
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,840
Actually,

524
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,360
winning the shoes is not that important.

525
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,840
What did you say?

526
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,480
Jiang Haoyue?

527
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,520
Why are you here?

528
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,560
You can’t win the championship with B.

529
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,200
What’s wrong with a B?

530
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,960
It means Meng has a lot of
room for improvement.

531
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,720
Thanks.

532
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:40,960
I’ll replace you.

533
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,560
Replace me?

534
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,560
No.

535
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,520
I don’t agree.

536
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,280
This is the most effective way

537
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,440
to improve performance
in a short period of time.

538
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,920
Jiang Haoyue.

539
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,120
This is a video arcade,

540
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,240
not a school.

541
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,200
This is a game,

542
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,040
not a test paper.

543
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,400
I’ve never seen you play

544
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,760
Drum Battle before.

545
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,320
Dare to try it?

546
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,160
Fine.

547
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,600
Haoyue.

548
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,240
What?

549
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,760
When did you

550
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,920
get so good at Drum Battle?

551
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,640
Recently.

552
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,640
I thought I only couldn’t beat you
in study.

553
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,960
Now I can’t even beat you

554
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,600
in video games.

555
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,640
I’m depressed.

556
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,520
I’m jealous.

557
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,680
I am unhappy.

558
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,320
Are you still a normal person?

559
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,840
I’m not as good as you think.

560
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,720
If you’re still modest at this point,

561
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,360
you seem overly proud.

562
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,200
I mean it.

563
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,320
I’m not as fast as Shi Che.

564
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,320
Then how did you beat him?

565
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,760
Whether it’s learning or playing,

566
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,920
there are methods and laws.

567
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,160
Through the laws of
mathematical algorithms,

568
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,400
combined with Drum Battle’s

569
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,600
even and odd techniques,

570
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,640
I was able to compensate for
my speed disadvantage.

571
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,080
However,

572
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,800
he didn’t lose to me
because of his speed.

573
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,920
Because of what then?

574
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,440
Because…

575
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,320
Because of his mentality.

576
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,200
I’ve been looking for you.
Why are you in the reading room?

577
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,600
Come on.

578
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,200
Let’s go practice the game.

579
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,960
I’d better finish my homework first.

580
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,200
Besides, my brother has
already replaced me.

581
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,480
How about

582
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:36,880
you two go practice?

583
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,560
It’s too boring here.

584
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,160
I’ll wait for you
at the basketball court.

585
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,560
Che.

586
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,120
Are you really going to team up
with Jiang Haoyue?

587
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,920
Is he good?

588
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,120
I feel like he’s not as good as me.

589
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,480
That’s the most annoying thing.

590
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,480
He’s good.

591
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,680
Why would he always

592
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,480
get between me and Meng?

593
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,560
Is he…?

594
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,880
What?

595
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,960
Is he Akagi Takenori?

596
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,600
What?

597
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,760
Why Akagi Takenori?

598
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,040
If Sakuragi wants to
get close to Haruko,

599
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,520
isn’t her brother the first person
he has to deal with?

600
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,880
In that case,

601
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,840
I’m still the hero of this play.

602
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,120
If you have to say so,

603
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,040
I have nothing to say.

604
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,480
Che. Let’s go.

605
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,960
Good luck, hero.

606
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,040
Hold these for me.

607
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,640
Okay.

608
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,840
We don’t have the same hand speed.

609
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,040
I have to listen to the music.

610
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,120
The sound is too low.

611
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,800
Come on.

612
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,240
Given the way you two are playing,

613
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,160
they would think

614
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,560
you’re playing a rivalry game.

615
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,680
I have to listen to the music.

616
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,040
I have to calculate.

617
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,280
Then why don’t you try

618
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,480
each other’s

619
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,440
way first?

620
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,280
Well...

621
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:33,920
How about

622
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,520
we go home now?

623
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,720
Cool down ourselves.

624
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:39,880
Fine.

625
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,440
What are you listening to?

626
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:53,840
English.

627
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,120
It’s really boring when they read it.

628
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,880
English needs to be sung to sound good.

629
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,800
DJ Lu Miao is tuned for you.

630
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:20,934

00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,920
I knew you’d like this.

638
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,840
It seems you can listen to music.

639
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,480
Your formula is really hard

640
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,760
for average people to understand.

641
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,600
Maybe

642
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,200
you could try listening to music?

643
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,520
I can try.

644
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,520
Jiang Haoyue, you’re so nice.

645
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,360
Instead of letting others change,

646
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,280
why not change myself?

647
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,480
Shi Che won’t say it,

648
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,320
but he really appreciates

649
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,680
your help.

650
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:16,840
And

651
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,680
you two are both double S types.

652
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,440
As long as you work together,

653
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,640
you’ll be godlike.

654
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,920
Why

655
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,160
do you have to help him win the shoes?

656
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,840
In fact, at the beginning,

657
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,920
I did go with the goal

658
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,840
of helping him win the shoes.

659
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,400
But after practicing for a few days,

660
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,480
I found that every time I got rated,

661
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,480
the score was a little higher
than last time.

662
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,760
My sense of accomplishment was strong.

663
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,520
Besides, you’re in this one.

664
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,800
A lot of people

665
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,440
in the school are concerned
about this matter.

666
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,240
One of you

667
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,520
is my brother

668
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,560
and the other is my buddy.

669
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,800
If you guys lose face, I lose face.

670
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,520
I can’t lose my face.

671
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,440
So you must do your best.

672
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,080
Understand?

673
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,040
I’ll try.

674
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,520
How can you be so cool?

675
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,640
So handsome!

676
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,360
How can someone be so cool?

677
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,240
What did you say?

678
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,800
I said…

679
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,240
Are the noodles ready?

680
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,200
I’m so hungry.

681
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,240
I want to eat them.

682
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,760
Let me see.

683
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,480
OK.

684
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,760
You can eat now.

685
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,520
Here are your chopsticks.

686
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,560
Let’s eat together.

687
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,640
Cheers!

688
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,360
You finished your homework fast today.

689
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,600
You two have a competition coming up.

690
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,400
I can’t delay your practice.

691
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,560
Guoguo.

692
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,240
Where is Shi Che?

693
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,080
He’s

694
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,440
in the bell tower.

695
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,080
He said he found some
kind of winning formula.

696
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,360
Let’s go.

697
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,840
Bye-bye.

698
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,480
Bye-bye.

699
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,640
Come on.

700
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,480
Do not change hands at even numbers.

701
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,640
That means…

702
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,360
Where did you get them?

703
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,560
I borrowed them from the honor guard.

704
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,280
From a friend.

705
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,560
There are some left and
right hands exchange sequences

706
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,560
and some accent structures,

707
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,200
which should help you understand.

708
00:35:18,287 --> 00:35:19,167
Use these.

709
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,400
They’re lighter.

710
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,760
This way our hands should be
at the same speed.

711
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,720
Give me one.

712
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:30,960
You can listen to music now?

713
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:32,920

00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,840
how could we have come this far?

754
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,160
Here’s a piece of duck blood.
Who wants it?

755
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,880
Give it to me.

756
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,080
Give it to him.

757
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,920
You must be tired after

758
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,720
playing for so long today.

759
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,320
It’s much more tiring than studying.

760
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,480
Not as tired as you are with your brain.

761
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,000
Why does it sound so weird?

762
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,480
Forget it, I’ll eat it myself.

763
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,800
Why are you looking at me?

764
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,800
I worked hard too.

765
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,640
No, wait.

766
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,800
Shouldn’t you take us to eat hot pot?

767
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,680
Didn’t you say so yourself?

768
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,520
Hot pot should be eaten together.

769
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,160
Spicy hot pot is only good
when eating alone.

770
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,640
Don’t talk nonsense here!

771
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,600
When did I ever say that?

772
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,120
So didn’t you think it was good enough

773
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,840
when we ate spicy hot pot together?

774
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,120
No!

775
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,440
He’s talking nonsense.

776
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,160
Every time I had spicy hot pot with you,

777
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,840
I felt happy

778
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,880
from

779
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,640
the inside.

780
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,760
You must eat spicy hot pot

781
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,360
with your friends, so it would

782
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,400
taste better, and bring you

783
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,000
more happiness

784
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,720
and more joy.

785
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,840
Right?

786
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:52,920
Meng, you…

787
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,240
Eat your food.

788
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,480
Enjoy it.

789
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,828
(The Top Drum Battle)

790
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:07,400
The two are really full of
fighting spirit

791
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,200
and keep hitting combos.

792
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,680
Another combo,

793
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,920
and another series of combos.

794
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:12,840
Very good.

795
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,840
It’s about to be our turn.

796
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,400
Are you nervous?

797
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,080
They’re going to

798
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,960
place very well.

799
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,480
A little bit.

800
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,160
Listen to me.

801
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,560
You pretend that no one else exists.

802
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,320
And then say in your mind,

803
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,760
what keeps me going

804
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,240
is the belief that I’ll never give up.

805
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,120
Not the shoes?

806
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,800
Let’s invite
the next group of challengers.

807
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,880
They are

808
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,880
Mr. Arrogance

809
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,640
and A Sapling.

810
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,320
OK, applause!

811
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,760
Okay, the two players are in position.

812
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,960
The last group is ready
to start the competition.

813
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,000
Here we go.

814
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,960
Go, Shi Che!

815
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,760
The battle is very intense.

816
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,840
They are not missing a single beat.

817
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,320
Go, Jiang Haoyue!

818
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,040
This group is amazing!

819
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,240
Another combo!

820
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,520
Combo, combo, combo.

821
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,280
Go for it!

822
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,160
These two are really good.

823
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,520
That’s great!

824
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,280
It’s the last part.

825
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,720
It’s the last part.

826
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,480
Come on!

827
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,120
Let’s give them
a little more applause, okay?

828
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,200
Come on!

829
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,040
Come on!

830
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,160
Come on!

831
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,440
All combos and all perfect.

832
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,200
This is the highest score so far.

833
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,280
So great!

834
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,360
We’ve got the highest score in the game.

835
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,880
Is that the highest score?

836
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,120
That’s great!

837
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:41,962
The highest score!

838
00:40:41,993 --> 00:40:43,280
Jiang Haoyue, the highest score!

839
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:43,920
Great!

840
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,080
I’m the top drummer!

841
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,640
Top drummer!

842
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,840
I am the King!

843
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,280
The King!

844
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,600
I’m a genius!

845
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,720
Be careful.

846
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,160
It’s okay. Just stand up there.

847
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,800
I’m a genius!

848
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,360
The world is ours!

849
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,960
It’s ours!

850
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,080
Two idiots.

851
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,520
You won?

852
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,800
You’re wearing them.

853
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,560
Do I look cool?

854
00:41:25,828 --> 00:41:27,122
Impressive!

855
00:41:27,122 --> 00:41:28,482
You guys really won?

856
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,200
Yes, we did.

857
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,760
Do you think we’re really good?

858
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,520
Do you have any admiration for us?

859
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,800
No, not really.

860
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,280
You’ll have to give me
extra points this time.

861
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,200
Not even a single point.

862
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,560
You’re too stingy.

863
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,800
What’s the use of knowing
how to play games?

864
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,920
These shoes are 1,600 yuan.

865
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,134
I won them on my own.

866
00:41:55,506 --> 00:41:57,906
You tell me that
playing games is useless?

867
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,560
I’m kind enough to give you

868
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,000
the title of Game Master.

869
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,120
Besides,

870
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,000
you got help from

871
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,880
Lu Miao and Jiang Haoyue.

872
00:42:29,897 --> 00:42:30,977
Why are you here alone?

873
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,880
It’s less crowded

874
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,880
and quieter here.

875
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,680
You’re here to get the drums
for the honor guard, right?

876
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,680
I’ll come with you.

877
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,520
Nice shoes.

878
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,600
Thank you for your help.

879
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,680
You’re my friend now.

880
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,120
No need to be so polite.

881
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,440
It’s all for Lu Miao.

882
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,560
For Lu Miao?

883
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,440
Give me that little castle.

884
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,560
Here.

885
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:10,760
Thank you!

886
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,760
Jiang Haoyue!

887
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,320
Come down and play sand together.

888
00:43:27,209 --> 00:43:28,387
He can’t play,

889
00:43:28,387 --> 00:43:29,800
so why did you ask him?

890
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,320
Who says he can’t play?

891
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,320
I will let him play to show you.

892
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:34,760
Jiang Haoyue.

893
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,520
Look what I’ve brought you.

894
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,880
Give me your hands.

895
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,160
It’s dirty.

896
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,200
Okay, now we’re the same.

897
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,040
We’re going to make one
even better than theirs.

898
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,520
How about a giant chocolate?

899
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,600
It’s just a square.

900
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,880
What’s so difficult about it?

901
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,040
So what do you want to make?

902
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,000
I’ll help you.

903
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,400
This is worse than the chocolate.
