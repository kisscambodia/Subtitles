=I’m Not Qualified To Be
Jiang Haoyue’s Sister=

30
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,978
My name is Lu Miao.

31
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,360
It’s the first day for my high school.

32
00:01:46,831 --> 00:01:48,760
I try my best to avoid one person.

33
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,320
He is my neighbor.

34
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,400
My childhood friend.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,720
He’s also the one who covered my glory

36
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,120
since childhood.

37
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,040
Jiang Haoyue!

38
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,760
Since the first day when he appeared,

39
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,680
I was forced to be his little sister.

40
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,640
We eat the same meals.

41
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,360
We drink the same water.

42
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,360
Even we take the same bus
to go to school.

43
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,946
But everyone can only see
his excellence.

44
00:02:13,987 --> 00:02:15,640
After years of knowing each other,

45
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,880
I deeply realize that

46
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,600
what being nobody means.

47
00:02:27,662 --> 00:02:29,160
So I decide that

48
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,560
I can’t let others know
our relationship.

49
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,840
Because

50
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,240
with him by my side,

51
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,400
I always become a nobody.

52
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,280
From today on,

53
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,480
I will stand out.

54
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,640
I don’t want others to recognize me
because I’m Jiang Haoyue’s sister.

55
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,280
Please give me a cabbage.

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,640
That’s right.

57
00:03:09,796 --> 00:03:11,160
Miao, going to school?

58
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,640
Shh.

59
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,400
Miao…

60
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,040
Shh.

61
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,160
That’s all I want.

62
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,960
Okay. I pack them for you.

63
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,000
Please weigh them.

64
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,160
Sir, here are your vegetables.

65
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,360
What’s wrong with you?

66
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,600
Lu Miao, what’re you doing?

67
00:03:25,412 --> 00:03:26,572
Be careful!

68
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:28,960
Here you are.

69
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,920
Sir, sorry.

70
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,600
Sorry.

71
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,560
It’s fine.

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,720
These bricks can be piled
as the goal.

73
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,600
Yeah.

74
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,560
Don’t take my bricks away!

75
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,320
Well, put them down.

76
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,000
Run.

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,720
Let’s play football.

78
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,480
Let’s play.

79
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,360
Wait to be punished later.

80
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,480
You are avoiding me?

81
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,000
I’m not.

82
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,720
I’m attracted to rock climbing

83
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,720
because I watched the Olympics
some time ago.

84
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,040
So I climb the wall

85
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,040
to experience it.

86
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,920
There is no rock climbing
in the Olympic.

87
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,160
You put me down first.

88
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,440
Well, you…

89
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,440
Put me down.

90
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,160
Why avoid me?

91
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,560
I don’t want others to recognize me

92
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,640
as your sister in high school.

93
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,080
I want others to know me

94
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,760
because I am Lu Miao.

95
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,720
Fine.

96
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,880
I wait for the bus at the last stop.

97
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,560
He is so obedient.

98
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,560
You bastard!

99
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,920
I bring you up for nothing.

100
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,920
You can’t take the ball by hands.

101
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,720
You little kids!

102
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,000
You dare to challenge me.

103
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,720
Our bricks…

104
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,120
Stop!

105
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,920
Stop!

106
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,320
Excuse me!

107
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:41,960
Be careful!

108
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,600
Sit here.

109
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
Why is she holding a brick?

110
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:45,880
I have no idea.

111
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,200
I actually meet you again!

112
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,200
If you don’t go to take the brick,

113
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,200
you won’t meet me.

114
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,600
You sit here.

115
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,520
Sit down.

116
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,520
Look! What is she doing?

117
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,960
Put your brick away.

118
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,400
You’re a bit handsome.

119
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,080
But I can’t use it right now.

120
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,600
A piece of film is expensive.

121
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,800
I will use it
for more meaning things.

122
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,840
What are more meaning things?

123
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,120
For example,

124
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,680
a speech for freshmen.

125
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,880
Won’t you give a speech
on the stage?

126
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,240
How about I take a picture
for you by then?

127
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,120
Forget it.

128
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,320
You will give the same speech
as before?

129
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,040
So,

130
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,680
what’s the problem?

131
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,600
It’s boring to read the example.

132
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,240
I change something for you.

133
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,760
What do you think?

134
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:39,880
Chang, like how?

135
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,360
I remember the last sentence

136
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,000
in your note is new…

New Journey.

138
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,120
Hope you work toward your new goals.

139
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,400
Right.

140
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,520
I change it into that

141
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,240
the past is meaningless.

142
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,000
For the fate you dislike,

143
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,760
from now on, don’t accept it.

144
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,320
How do you think?

145
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,040
Childish!

146
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,360
Forget it!

147
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,200

30 seconds.

152
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,520
Wait.

00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,440
Hope you have good school days.

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,880
So do you.

156
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,200

My dad likes cashew nuts.

172

My mom likes apples.

173

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,640
Really.

184
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,280
Because

185
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,240

00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,440
So funny?

194
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,960
This girl is very funny.

195
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,560
I have my reason
to bring this brick here.

196
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,840
Enough! Stop explaining it.

197
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,440
I don’t feel strange
whatever you put in your backpack.

198
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,360
Just don’t disturb me.

199
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,800
Sorry about earlier.

200
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,800
Lu…

201
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,320
…Miao.

202
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,620
(Class 1, Grade 2)

203
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,160
Be quiet, students from Grade 1.

204
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,680
Why our class don’t move

205
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,880
to the second floor with other classes?

206
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,520
Why do you think?

207
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,200
Teachers look after Jiang Haoyue.

208
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,080
We have to stay in the same floor

209
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,600
with freshmen of Grade 1

210
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,320
and be mocked by students
from the second floor.

211
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,800
Will we stay here for three years?

212
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,840
It’s like we’re repeaters.

213
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,200
It sucks.

214
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,560
Why am I in the same class
with Jiang Haoyue?

215
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,760
He…

216
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,040
The opening ceremony is about to start.

217
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,120
Students of all classes
please go to the auditorium.

218
00:12:56,226 --> 00:12:58,040
The hot summer has passed.
We usher in cool Autumn.

219
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:58,653
(Nanfeng No. 1 High School)

220
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,960
Our school is full of energy

221
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,360
because of you.

222
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,480
Today, I feel honored to

223
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,360
make a speech here

224
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,960
on behalf of students.

225
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,440
I’d like to extend my sincere respect
to all the students and faculty

226
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,120
and give my best regards
to all freshmen.

227
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,600
It turns out he is Jiang Haoyue.

228
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,600
I thought all super learners are ugly.

229
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,520
Who has this senior’s
contact information?

230
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,640
He’s cool.

231
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,600
Senior?

232
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,000
Naive!

233
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,880
Everyone will become a person…

234
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,840
Boring.

235
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,200
Perfunctory.

236
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,880
Routine.

237
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,280
Prior to admission…

238
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,520
Hold on. Let’s me check it out.

239
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,680
Alright.

240
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,520
Prior to admission,

241
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,760
everyone, more or less,

242
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,600
has gains and losses,

243
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,440
has joys and grievances.

244
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,480
But now,

245
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,400
your future is unknown.

246
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,440
I want to tell you,

247
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,840
no matter what happened in the past,

248
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,280
the past is meaningless.

249
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,440
After entering the high school,

250
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,040
for the fate you dislike,

251
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,320
from now on…

252
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,000
Don’t accept it.

253
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,240
…don’t accept it.

254
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,760
A nice speech.

255
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,520
Never thought a super scholar
also watches Naruto.

256
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,120
This guy sounds interesting.

257
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,240
I told him about that.

258
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,720
Who are you?

259
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,120
You are qualified to lecture
Jiang Haoyue?

260
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,560
He’s my…

261
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,520
Your…

262
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,840
My senior next to my class.

263
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,320
Wake up!

264
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,400
Stop dreaming!

265
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,160
Just wait and see.

266
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,120
Finally,

267
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,640
I will stand on the stage
of the auditorium

268
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,201
and let Jiang Haoyue
think highly of me.

269
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,820
(Being excellence is a choice)

270
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,953
(The difference between you and the best
lies in efforts, but not intelligence)

271
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:43,403
(No need to sleep too long when living,
you will sleep all the time after death)

272
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,900
(Bed is the grave for youth)

273
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,000
The meaning of sets
is not complicated.

274
00:14:49,581 --> 00:14:50,822
(Bed is the grave for youth)
In our lives,

275
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:53,760
we can meet all kinds of sets.

276
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,360
See here.

277
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:57,960
On the blackboard,

278
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,080
natural numbers and nonnatural numbers

279
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,160
have different scopes.

280
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,320
The representing methods of their sets

281
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,880
are also different.

282
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,000
Okay. We learn

283
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,200
the nature of integer next.

284
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,520
If a number has an odd number
in the last place,

285
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,360
then this number can be divided by two.

286
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,240
If one number has a number in the units

287
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,400
which can be divided by three,

288
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,960
then this number can be divided
by three.

289
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,360
If the last two digits of one number

290
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,040
can be divided by four,

291
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,528
then this number

292
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,128
can be divided by four.
(Being excellence is a choice)

293
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,160
Let me have a breath

294
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,080
of honorable air on the stage.

295
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,140
(Nanfeng No. 1 High School)

296
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,760
I am Lu Miao from Class 10, Grade 1.

297
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,320
Today,

298
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,320
I can’t stay awake in the class.

299
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,760
It makes me one step away from
being an excellent person.

300
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,760
I’m guilty.

301
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,760
I confess my mistake.

302
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,720
As a punishment,
I won’t have lunch today.

303
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,320
But

304
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,920
I still want to take a picture.

305
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,160
Who is there?

306
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,280
Today is such a bad day for me!

307
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,360
If found,

308
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,120
I will be listed in the blacklist.

309
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,240
Who’s there?

310
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,880
Who did this?

311
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,120
Come out!

312
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,440
He finally leaves.

313
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,240
Is anybody here?

314
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,280
I’m screwed.

315
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,080
It’s such a mess.

316
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,480
I have to tell Mr. Yang quickly.

317
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,680
Hello.

318
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,840
I left this camera
when I gave a speech this morning.

319
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,080
It is yours.

320
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,840
You take it well.

321
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,760
Don’t drop it again.

322
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,720
Okay. I see.

323
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,600
I’ll be right there.

324
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,040
Is anybody here?

325
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,440
Is anybody here?

326
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,315
Is anybody here?

327
00:18:07,315 --> 00:18:08,880
Jiang Haoyue.

328
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,680
Be quick!

329
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,800
Help me open the door.

330
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,280
Door!

331
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,320
Door!

332
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,200
Hurry up!

333
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,560
Open the door for me.

334
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,840
No.

335
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,840
Don’t shoot.

336
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,960
Hurry up!

337
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,200
Why stand still?

338
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,880
Jiang Haoyue!

339
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,960
Open the door.

340
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,560
Stop shooting!

341
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,320
Stop!

342
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,600
Let me out!

343
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,000
Jiang Haoyue!

344
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,960
Why are you doing there?

345
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,780
(Office of Educational Administration)

346
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,000
Why were you in the auditorium?

347
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,760
The door is unlocked.

348
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,920
Why didn’t you have classes?

349
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,960
You two are in love?

350
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,000
No.

351
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,800
What on earth is your relationship?

352
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,400
What’s your relationship
with Jiang Haoyue?

353
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,600
He is my old brother.

354
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,440
Good.

355
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,920
You deserve to be
Jiang Haoyue’s little sister.

356
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,080
Thank you.

357
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,080
You’re Jiang Haoyue’s sister.

358
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,400
How could you fight with others?

359
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,280
Mr. Yang, we have no relations.

360
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,080
I went to the auditorium to…

361
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,520
To…

362
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,160
Make a pilgrimage.

363
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,600
Pilgrimage?

364
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,280
That’s right.

365
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,600
The holy pattern

366
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,000
in the school flag

367
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,440
made me

368
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,480
stretch hands

369
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,160
to touch it and get some wisdom.

370
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,520
But I was too excited

371
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,320
in my heart.

372
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,320
I couldn’t control

373
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,760
my strength.

374
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,640
I love our school so much.

375
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,440
About this,

376
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,080
Jiang Haoyue can be my witness.

377
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,760
Right?

378
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,640
Is it true?

379
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,560
Mr. Yang.

380
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,680
It’s true we don’t know each other.

381
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,520
No, we don’t.

382
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,000
I went to the auditorium

383
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,520
to get my camera back.

384
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,080
They have the same father,
Lu Yongfei.

385
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,000
No wonder
they are unwilling to admit it.

386
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,160
They are brother and sister
from a blended family.

387
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,400
Lu Miao,

388
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,640
do you know
you have destroyed public facilities

389
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,320
and violated school rules
and regulations?

390
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,360
Do cleaning for one week
as the punishment.

391
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:01,960
Go back.

392
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,320
Mr. Yang,

393
00:21:08,446 --> 00:21:09,166
I will go now.

394
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,840
Go.

395
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,760
He is heartless.

396
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,360
I didn’t admit our relationship.

397
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,800
He actually cooperated with me.

398
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,760
Since the childhood,

399
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,040
I took blame for him

400
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,360
and suffered a lot.

401
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,560
If you took blame for me,

402
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,840
I would have been dead long ago.

403
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,360
What?

404
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,480
You block my way.

405
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,240
It’s no need to kowtow.

406
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,520
I was in bad luck

407
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,840
because of this lace.

408
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,480
This kind of lace like nylon
is easily to get loose.

409
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,800
I teach you only once.

410
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,440
Look carefully.

411
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,840
Nothing to be proud of.

412
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,480
I have no interest in it.

413
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,560
Yes, you’re interested
in making troubles.

414
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,800
Don’t forget to sweep the floor.

415
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,680
See you.

416
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,720
Jiang Haoyue…

417
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,400
Hey, desk mate.

418
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,160
We meet again.

419
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,480
You also walk this way?

420
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,320
Which bus do you take?

421
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,840
I just saw Jiang Haoyue tie your lace.

422
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,760
Don’t tell others.

423
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,640
Just pretend that nothing happened.

424
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,320
Nothing happened.

425
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,600
You cooperate with me
and answer several questions.

426
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,000
I consider keeping it secret.

427
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,640
What questions?

428
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,120
What’s your relationship
with Jiang Haoyue?

429
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,960
Neighbors?

430
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,320
Childhood friends?

431
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,480
Family members?

432
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,200
If others were you,

433
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,560
they would wake up with laughs.

434
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,000
Why do you hide it?

435
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,320
I don’t want to be a nobody

436
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,840
behind Jiang Haoyue.

437
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,440
I want to have a brilliant life

438
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,280
belonging to me.

439
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,120
I don’t see any shining points
about you.

440
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,120
Except my bad grades,

441
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,760
I have many merits.

442
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,000
For example,
I’m ready to help others.

443
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,240
I’m outgoing.

444
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,800
I have no interest in you.

445
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,560
Desk mate…

446
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,280
Win by my own draw. I win.

447
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,560
Why do I lose again?

448
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,760
Bad machine!

449
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,400
Pay me the money!

450
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,760
He must cheat.

451
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,880
Yes, don’t fool us.

452
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,680
What’s up, buddy?

453
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,040
Find him to ask for money.

454
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,880
I’m leaving.

455
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,600
You are the owner?

456
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,440
Did you do something to the machine?

457
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,240
I’m talking to you.

458
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,520
Where are you looking at?

459
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,480
Are you deaf?

460
00:24:02,137 --> 00:24:02,657
Go on.

461
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,320
Go on.

462
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:04,880
It hurts.

463
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,280
Please be gentle.

464
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,320
Come on!

465
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:06,920
Bro.

466
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,200
What?

467
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,560
Don’t pay me, right?

468
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,280
It’s nothing.

469
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,640
You go on playing.

470
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,480
Bro,

471
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,600
let’s talk at the door.

472
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,160
Okay?

473
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,480
It hurts.

474
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,160
Bro,

475
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,880
please be gentle.

476
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,880
Bro,

477
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,680
it hurts.

478
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,680
Don’t pay me, right?

479
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,720
Come on!

480
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,280
Bro…

481
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,960
You got a death wish.

482
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,640
I pay you

483
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,480
all expenses.

484
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,080
Okay?

485
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,840
Give him money.

486
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,640
Pay me?

487
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:39,640
Give him money.

488
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,000
Hurry up.

489
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
You ask me to pay, right?

490
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,920
Give him money.

491
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,320
Give him money.

492
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,000
Money!

493
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,200
Bro, it’s done.

494
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:48,760
Go away.

495
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,240
Don’t you have eyes?

496
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,680
Are you blind?

497
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,880
Just wait and see.

498
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,160
Shut up.

499
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,160
Stop.

500
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,760
Are you blind?

501
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,400
You see me,
but you don’t call me dad.

502
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,960
Take it.

503
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,520
I don’t go back recently.

504
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,600
What relationship is the guy
with the owner?

505
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,440
He may be his son.

506
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,800
The owner is your dad?

507
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,520
Get out of my way.

508
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,320
Call your dad.

509
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,640
As long as he pays us,

510
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,360
we won’t hurt you.

511
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,160
I have nothing to do with him.

512
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:34,840
Get out of my way.

513
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:35,880
Where do you go?

514
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,440
It’s your choice.

515
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,120
Get out of my way.

516
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,400
Get out?

517
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,880
I’ll beat you up today.

518
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,600
Bad choice.

519
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,920
Beat him!

520
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:54,960
Pay me or not!

521
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,080
Pay me or not!

522
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,120
Pay me back.

523
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,440
Pay me back.

524
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,680
Wanna run?

525
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,240
Go. Go to your dad.

526
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,200
Will I have no girlfriends

527
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,080
in my high school?

528
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,640
You have the nerve!

529
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,880
Beat him!

530
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,720
Bro,

531
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,240
he is disabled.

532
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,240
What about let him go?

533
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,320
Will you pay my money back?

534
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,960
Where are you going?

535
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,240
This guy is stubborn.

536
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,440
If you pay me money back,
nothing will happen.

537
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,760
Rubbish!

538
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,520
How dare you!

539
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,960
Who are you?

540
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,280
If you dare to beat my brother,

541
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,840
I will give you a lesson.

542
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:32,760
Jiang Haoyue.

543
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,120
Go away.

544
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,720
It’s dirty.

545
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,560
Neither of you can leave.

546
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,080
You play the hero!

547
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,360
Go to hell!

548
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,960
Stop!

549
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,200
Are you powerful enough?

550
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,600
You are powerful, right?

551
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,360
Stop!

552
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,640
Bro,

553
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,600
if we continue, he will be dead.

554
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,240
Stand up!

555
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,800
Jiang Haoyue!

556
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,400
If you dare touch her,

557
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,480
I risk my life to fight with you.

558
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,400
You stop!

559
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:34,720
Bro…

560
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,400
Don’t run.

561
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
I help you chase them.

562
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:45,880
Don’t run.

563
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,840
Bro, does he still chase us?

564
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,600
I can’t run.

565
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,400
Not yet.

566
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,120
I see you bully others
from a long distance.

567
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,600
Since you have the nerve to fight,

568
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,080
then don’t be afraid of
being caught.

569
00:29:59,240 --> 00:29:59,640
Go.

570
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,080
Beat him!

571
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,040
Don’t cry.

572
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,760
I’m not crying.

573
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,240
Your hair is a mess.

574
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,400
Your eyes swell up.

575
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,680
Listen to me. Don’t cry.

576
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,480
If you continue to cry,
you will not look good.

577
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,040
Later, we go to my house first

578
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,200
and get your clothes changed
before you go home.

579
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,800
I help you wash your clothes.

580
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,640
Okay.

581
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,520
Well…

582
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,360
Don’t tell your parents

583
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,880
about what happened today.

584
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,960
In recent days,

585
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,640
I don’t go to your house for dinner.

586
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,800
If they ask you why,

587
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:32,800
you tell them

588
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,640
Jiang Haoyue is in bad mood.

589
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,720
Then they won’t ask more.

590
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,200
You should be scared today.

591
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,800
It’s all my fault.

592
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,920
I shouldn’t avoid you.

593
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,360
I should go home
together with you.

594
00:33:18,406 --> 00:33:19,366
It’s not your fault.

595
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,920
If no one came

596
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,200
to help, what should you do?

597
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,680
You appeared finally.

598
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,640
What’s wrong?

599
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,960
Sit down.

600
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,960
Does your leg hurt again?

601
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,960
I’ll get your medicine.

602
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,560
I’m fine.

603
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,120
You sit down.

604
00:33:39,856 --> 00:33:40,256
No…

605
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,920
How is your leg?

606
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:44,920
It’s fine.

607
00:33:56,887 --> 00:33:58,207
I want to see pictures.

608
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,320
Let’s go to and leave school
together afterwards.

609
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,360
You’re not afraid…

610
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,040
That’s not important.

611
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,760
Only you are the most important.

612
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,400
You take me as your brother?

613
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:47,460
(Emergency building)

614
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,740
(Operating room)

615
00:35:49,831 --> 00:35:50,391
Haoyue!

616
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:52,800
Haoyue!

617
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:53,920
Haoyue!

618
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,095
Haoyue!

619
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,120
Kid…

620
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,080
Where is the kid?

621
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,240
Sorry.

622
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,840
Who hit my kid?

623
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,640
Don’t be anxious.

624
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,120
I’m asking you who hit my son.

625
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,280
It’s me.

626
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,600
Why did you beat him?

627
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,120
Step aside!

628
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:12,920
Wait,

629
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,800
your kid is inside.

630
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,480
We hit your kid.

631
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,360
It’s our fault.

632
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:16,918
Either punishment

633
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:17,509
or payment,

634
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,600
we never deny it.

635
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,400
I’m asking how serious

636
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,360
you hit my son.

637
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:20,800
Tell me.

638
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,640
What are you doing?

639
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,480
It’s hospital.

640
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,680
It’s not a place where
you can make troubles and fight.

641
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,240
Are you the patient’s relative?

642
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,840
I’m his dad.

643
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,880
We will have an operation,

644
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,840
so you need to sign.

645
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,800
Amputation?

646
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,760
What does it mean?

647
00:36:39,734 --> 00:36:40,934
I’m asking you.

648
00:36:41,112 --> 00:36:42,472
What is amputation?

649
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:43,720
Sir,

650
00:36:43,997 --> 00:36:45,037
please listen to me.

651
00:36:45,072 --> 00:36:46,352
It’s all my fault.

652
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,080
But the consequences
are irrevocable.

653
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,080
Please sign your name first.

654
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,640
One signature for one leg!

655
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,040
Are you willing to do that?

656
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,880
I’ll be responsible for this kid.

657
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,200
You have to sign your name now.

658
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,200
Your kid is waiting
in the operating room.

659
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,640
Without your signature,
the operation can’t be made.

660
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,040
I’ll kill you, you hear me?

661
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,880
I kill you!

662
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,440
I must kill you.

663
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,320
Don’t be impulsive.
Don’t be impulsive.

664
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:04,880
Let go of me.

665
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,640
Bro…

666
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,280
Please calm down.

667
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,640
Your kid is in critical condition.

668
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,080
Sign your name first, okay?

669
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,040
Sign your name first.

670
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,360
Save the kid first.

671
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,720
Calm down.

672
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,440
We will take all responsibilities.

673
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,240
Don’t blame yourself too hard.

674
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,560
Sorry.

675
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,240
I will think of ways.

676
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,120
I will think of ways.

677
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,160
My son is only 9.

678
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,680
From now on,

679
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,920
he is disabled.

680
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,000
I also have a kid.

681
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:03,840
It’s a girl.

682
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,400
I can understand

683
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,360
your feelings.

684
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,360
Listen up.

685
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,080
All of your family

686
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,080
must be responsible for my son.

687
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,740
Fully.

688
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,360
Or I will kill you and your family.

689
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,880
I know.

690
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,160
From now on,

691
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,960
Jiang Haoyue is also my son.

692
00:38:45,747 --> 00:38:46,427
Miao,

693
00:38:46,856 --> 00:38:48,416
do you remember what I tell you?

694
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,360
I remember.

695
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,560
Call him Haoyue after I go inside.

696
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,080
I can’t make him angry.

697
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:52,760
Good.

698
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,960
Miao.

699
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,240
Don’t keep looking at his leg.

700
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,160
You know?

701
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,720
So troublesome!

702
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,797
I don’t want to see him.

703
00:38:59,912 --> 00:39:01,843
Do you want to raise chicks?

704
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,120
I do.

705
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,120
Then be good.

706
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,000
Okay.

707
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:06,960
Miao.

708
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,880
Remember to share it with him.

709
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,640
No problem.

710
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,360
You can’t eat first.

711
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,280
It’s flavor of crispy rice.

712
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,600
Your mouth is watering.

713
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,680
Jiang Haoyue, glad to see you.

714
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,520
My name is Lu Miao.

715
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,240
I’m studying on Grade 2
of Dongnan Elementary School.

716
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,240
I’m eight.

717
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,760
Are you sleepy?

718
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,760
I will finish quickly.

719
00:39:43,128 --> 00:39:44,968
You have a sister now.

720
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,160
That’s me.

721
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:46,920
My name is Lu Miao.

722
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,240
You can call me Miao.

723
00:39:58,703 --> 00:40:01,023
Haoyue, I give you my chocolate.

724
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,160
Haoyue,

725
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,440
get well soon.

726
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,000
