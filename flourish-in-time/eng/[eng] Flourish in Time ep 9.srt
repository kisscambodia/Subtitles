For the School New Year Gala,

32
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,716
two hosts will be chosen from liberal
art class and science class each.

33
00:01:42,106 --> 00:01:43,866
Is there any volunteer?

34
00:01:46,918 --> 00:01:48,478
(Class 10, Grade 1)
At the School New Year Gala,

35
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,640
our class must present a performance.

36
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,600
Is there any volunteer

37
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,680
for it?

38
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,520
Sir, I will!

39
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,960
I can eat a watermelon in ten seconds!

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,120
I can bring the house down with a dunk!

41
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,480
Sir, I can do everything!

42
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,600
The study is intensive in our class,

43
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,640
but we should play an active role

44
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,120
in the school event.

45
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,468
Sir, choose me!

46
00:02:07,468 --> 00:02:08,268
Ziye.

47
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:09,168
The New Year Gala!

48
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,560
Don’t you wanna join it?

49
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,040
I’m not good at performance.

50
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,400
What matters is to participate.

51
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,200
We’ll have fun with the rehearsal.

52
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,520
Sir, look here!

53
00:02:17,234 --> 00:02:17,674
Well.

54
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,760
Since you are all so active...

55
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,240
Let’s do it together.

56
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,250
This week,

57
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,120
get your performance ready.

58
00:02:23,168 --> 00:02:24,048
Let’s score the performances

59
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,440
on the class meeting next week

60
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,560
and choose a representative
for our class.

61
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,160
How is it?

62
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,880
Yes!

63
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,951
I’ll place a ballot box on the podium.

64
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,120
You will vote for the candidates.

65
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,320
It’s bad to be chosen.
Our study will be affected.

66
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:34,920
Put it in when you decide it.

67
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,000
We’ll count votes
at the class meeting next week.

68
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,960
I don’t want to go.

69
00:02:40,143 --> 00:02:41,023
Alright. Silence.

70
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,040
Discuss it after class.

71
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,080
Continue to study.

72
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,480
It’s bad to be chosen.

73
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,920
Our study will be affected.

74
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:55,021
We four can form a group for the gala.

75
00:02:55,165 --> 00:02:57,805
People will be overwhelmingly amazed

76
00:02:58,531 --> 00:02:59,411
at our courage

77
00:03:00,043 --> 00:03:01,043
and wisdom.

78
00:03:01,368 --> 00:03:02,288
I have only one thought.

79
00:03:02,693 --> 00:03:03,573
I wanna play princess.

80
00:03:03,906 --> 00:03:04,900
(Stop)

81
00:03:05,425 --> 00:03:06,225
Boring.

82
00:03:06,293 --> 00:03:07,693
I’m energetic at any performance.

83
00:03:08,103 --> 00:03:08,943
Do you agree, Meng?

84
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,360
I wanna

85
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,320
play a role

86
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,840
that I’ve ever experienced before,

87
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,480
like

88
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,800
a straight-A student.

89
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,840
Is there any performance

90
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,520
that I can have fun
being a straight-A student?

91
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,080
We have different ideas.

92
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,280
Why don’t we prepare separately?

93
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,240
That won’t do.

94
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,320
It’s more fun

95
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,320
when we prepare for the gala together.

96
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,720
Exactly.

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,520
Friendship is the best memory of youth.

98
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,640
I agree with it.

99
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,880
What’s the use of that?

100
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,400
If our group performance

101
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,000
isn’t chosen,

102
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,440
it will be all in vain.

103
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,680
What to do then?

104
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,720
Look at this.

105
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,800
That’s child’s play.

106
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,360
Is this child’s play?

107
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,680
If so,

108
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,560
I have to do something big.

109
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,040
With all due respect,

110
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,400
I can’t believe my eyes.

111
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:18,960
Hey.

112
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,000
I voted for you to be the host.

113
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,800
I’ll vote for you.

114
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,240
No kidding.

115
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,280
I’m serious.

116
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,640
You aren’t afraid that
your study will be affected.

117
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,720
Are you afraid?

118
00:04:33,818 --> 00:04:35,660
(Qu Wei)

119
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,080
I’m experienced in formation.

120
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,440
This is the stage where we’ll perform.

121
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,760
Guoguo will perform here.

122
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,200
Lu Miao will be here.

123
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,760
This is me.

124
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,000
You and I will perform together.

125
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,600
No.

126
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,840
Lu Miao will be my partner.

127
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,880
You will be

128
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,720
the discarded robots I brought back

129
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,640
from an Arabian desert.

130
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,760
Why is it Arabia?

131
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,760
That’s the plot.

132
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,400
Every show has the plot.

133
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,800
What’s my role?

134
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,000
You will

135
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,280
wear a beautiful uniform

136
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,040
smile by my side,

137
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,080
and walk with the rhythm.

138
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,240
I can do an Arabic basketball show,

139
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,640
with the music and beats.

140
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,440
That will be cool.

141
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,200
Sounds like a good idea.

142
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,440
It can be named
“Western Arabian Basketball”.

143
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:21,800
This is good.

144
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,400
Isn’t it more awesome?

145
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,920
Since it’s a sci-fi theme,

146
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,920
I’ll play that scientist.

147
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,960
In the end,

148
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,640
you’ll all be modified by me

149
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,600
into super evolutionary robots.

150
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,000
Why will you be the scientist?

151
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,800
Since you are the scientist,

152
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,000
I can be a scientist, too.

153
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,520
Given your IQ,
you can’t be a scientist!

154
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,600
What’s wrong with my IQ?

155
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,560
Your IQ is low.

156
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,520
Alright. Stop.

157
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,520
What’s wrong with my low IQ?

158
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,520
We are a perfect match.

159
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,480
She is my partner.

160
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,360
And she likes comics.

161
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,200
So do I.

162
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,080
We can work together.

163
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,800
You’re a muscle-headed fool.

164
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,480
Don’t you know it?

165
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:53,920
I...

166
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,760
Performing with Shi Che,

167
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,000
I think that will be a disaster

168
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,720
in my memory.

169
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,560
Shi Che is a nice guy.

170
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,280
Why can’t you get along with him?

171
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,200
He is self-conceit,

172
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,040
with low IQ.

173
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,040
He even dragged you down
at the autumn tour.

174
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,880
Do you forget it?

175
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,640
Never mind.
You two are of the same kind.

176
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,960
We can be friends.

177
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,920
Why can’t you be friends with him?

178
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,960
Give me a break.

179
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,800
Ballot box.

180
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,280
Hello, sir.

181
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,160
Who will you vote to be the host?

182
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,440
Jiang Haoyue.

183
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,560
He has no pressure from study.

184
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,200
We think alike.

185
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,600
Who do you think they will vote?

186
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,600
Jiang Haoyue.

187
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,560
You are surprisingly popular.

188
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,640
At the morning exercise,

189
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,520
I overheard your classmates

190
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,320
that they’d vote for you to be the host.

191
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,560
What?

192
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,400
Aren’t you happy about that?

193
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,280
I’m not interested.

194
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,680
Blockhead.

195
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,720
Youth

196
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,560
is not just about study.

197
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,240
Some other memories are needed.

198
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,120
Did you sign up?

199
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,800
Yes.

200
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,600
Ziye, Shi Che,

201
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,800
Guoguo and I.

202
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,600
The four of us formed a group.

203
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,000
We’ll perform a robot dance.

204
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,720
It’s almost the end of the term.

205
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,960
Don’t get your study affected.

206
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,480
Or Aunt Fang will scold you again.

207
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,520
I know.

208
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,120
But I have you.

209
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,800
The host. Think about it.

210
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,600
Why?

211
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,480
Then we can rehearse

212
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,800
and go home together

213
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,680
after school.

214
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,440
I can wait for you as well.

215
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:44,821
(Math Test Paper for Grade 1)
Did I do it wrong again?

216
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,800
You’ve never done it right.

217
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,040
(Class 10, Grade 1)

218
00:07:55,378 --> 00:07:56,098
Hello, guys.

219
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,850
I’m a scientist from Arabia.

220
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,480
Lu Miao.

221
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,360
The gala host has been voted.

222
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,200
Is it my brother?

223
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,280
There will be two hosts.

224
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,960
The host of liberal art class
is chosen.

225
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,520
Who?

226
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,080
Su Daifei.

227
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,000
How come it’s her?

228
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,300
(Class 1, Grade 2)

229
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,120
The host of liberal art class
has been voted.

230
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,680
I know.

231
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,480
It’s Su Daifei.

232
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,280
The school belle.

233
00:08:46,131 --> 00:08:47,091
Jiang Haoyue.

234
00:08:47,146 --> 00:08:48,306
If you are selected,

235
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,240
you two will be a good match.

236
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,280
Are you envious?

237
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,880
Why didn’t you go for the host?

238
00:08:53,628 --> 00:08:54,428
Yes.

239
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,680
Yes. Qu Wei.

240
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,760
You can be the host.

241
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:00,800
Me?

242
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,560
Hosts have to rehearse.

243
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,360
A waste of time.

244
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,240
I’m not that interested.

245
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,000
Are you?

246
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,960
Don’t you wanna beat me once
in popularity?

247
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,240
Yes. You can vie for it

248
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,920
and beat him fair and square.

249
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,080
But the voting...

250
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,240
No worries.

251
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,800
Leave it to me.

252
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,760
Your sister is so passionate about me.

253
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,560
Don’t overthink.

254
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,280
I’m not interested in her.

255
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,920
I like beauties.

256
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,960
Do you mean she’s ugly?

257
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,480
No.

258
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,280
She’s beautiful.

259
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,160
So, are you interested in her?

260
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,920
Do your exercises.

261
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,080
Classmates from Class 1, Grade 2!
Look here!

262
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,960
I’m glad to recommend a host to you,

263
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,160
Qu Wei!

264
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,600
Excuse me.

265
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,160
He is an excellent student,

266
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,000
humorous and handsome!

267
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,320
Lu Miao.

268
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:51,840
What do you think of him?

269
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,520
We’ve cast the vote.

270
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,600
He’s good,

271
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,240
but we’ve cast votes

272
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,280
for Jiang Haoyue.

273
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,040
What about you?

274
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,480
I haven’t voted.

275
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,080
Please vote for Qu Wei!

276
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,320
He really wants to be the host!

277
00:09:59,320 --> 00:09:59,840
I’ll think about it.

278
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,040
Excuse me.

279
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,240
Think about it.

280
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,000
What’s the fuss?

281
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,120
You’re making it like a debut.

282
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,160
Do it with me.

283
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,600
Smile and wave your hands.

284
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,080
Hey, guys!

285
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,920
Please vote for Qu Wei!

286
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,720
Bow.

287
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,640
Guys!

288
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,280
Qu Wei!

289
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:17,920
No. I’m going back.

290
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,600
He’s excellent and humorous.

291
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,840
Guys,

292
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,000
please vote for Qu Wei!

293
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,560
Look here, guys!

294
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,720
Stop.

295
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,600
Qu Wei is a perfect host

296
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
(Qu Wei)
for the New Year gala!

297
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,520
Look here, guys!

298
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,320
You won’t be disappointed!

299
00:10:34,443 --> 00:10:35,787
Guys!

300
00:10:35,787 --> 00:10:36,703
(Ballot box)

301
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:39,400
Be sure to vote for Qu Wei!

302
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,320
Guoguo.

303
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,000
Hello.

304
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,840
Where are they?

305
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,960
They went to canvass for Qu Wei.

306
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,760
Qu Wei?

307
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,960
Are they so close already?

308
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,320
No idea.

309
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,800
You come in time.

310
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,560
Let’s practice.

311
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,400
I won’t.

312
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,360
I’m adept at basketball.

313
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,880
I’m gonna buy snacks.
You practice first.

314
00:11:07,428 --> 00:11:07,828
But...

315
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,120
Excuse me. Please vote for Qu Wei!

316
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,920
Let him be the host

317
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,920
and win honor for your class!

318
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,160
But I’ve voted for Jiang Haoyue.

319
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,160
Don’t bother.

320
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,600
21 students have voted for Jiang Haoyue.

321
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,200
Just 21.

322
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,600
How can you give up so easily?

323
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,240
Lu Miao.

324
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,480
He means,

325
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,960
there are 40 students in his class.

326
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,400
21 is already over a half.

327
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,560
Your friend is much smarter than you.

328
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,480
Your brother will be chosen.

329
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,960
Why are you more disappointed than me?

330
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,840
We should find another way.

331
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,240
You can just wait

332
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,760
and expect your brother’s show.

333
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,200
I...

334
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:49,880
I’m off.

335
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,280
Just accept it.

336
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,680
Jiang Haoyue

337
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,560
is bound to host with Su Daifei

338
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,160
together.

339
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,560
Let’s go for classes.

340
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,320
Come to the Tech building.
Emergency.

341
00:12:22,731 --> 00:12:24,491
He’s fooled away.

342
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,280
Qu Wei.

343
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,040
What are you doing?

344
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,160
Mr. Yang.

345
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,480
This matter has nothing to do

346
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,880
with my student Qu Wei.

347
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,400
Lu Miao. What’s going on?

348
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,200
Yes,

349
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,480
it has nothing to do with him.

350
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,400
Why did you fake votes for him?

351
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,000
I...

352
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,240
It’s not all her fault.

353
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,360
I did want to be the host.

354
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,120
Just to choose a host.

355
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,440
Why bother to vote?

356
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,520
It’s messed up now.

357
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,680
Yes.

358
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,440
Other than Qu Wei,

359
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,360
who else are the candidates?

360
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,040
Jiang Haoyue.

361
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,400
Your class may let him be the host.

362
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,400
We should respect the students’ choice.

363
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,360
Don’t talk.

364
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,240
Go.

365
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,040
Go.

366
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,540
(Hosts: Jiang Haoyue, Su Daifei)

367
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,440
I meant to waive at the vote counting.

368
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,640
Your sister has skipped it for you.

369
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,600
Daifei, look. Jiang Haoyue.

370
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,240
Jiang Haoyue.

371
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,600
Glad to be your partner.

372
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,840
See you at the rehearsal.

373
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,320
It’s fine.

374
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,360
Let’s go for classes.

375
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,160
Thanks to your assist,

376
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,760
next week, Su Daifei and your brother

377
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,920
will be in the rehearsal room
as partners.

378
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,440
They’ll write the host script together,

379
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,520
becoming soulmates

380
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,960
when they have a brainstorm.

381
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,160
And even...

382
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,720
Cut it out.

383
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,000
I’m wrong. Okay?

384
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,880
No wonder she helped Qu Wei canvass.

385
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,200
Luckily, she failed.

386
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,280
God bless me.

387
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,880
I’m thinking,

388
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,600
we seldom

389
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,000
rehearsed the dance.

390
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,320
Will it be messed up?

391
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,880
Don’t worry. We work well together.

392
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,480
Rehearsal is unnecessary.

393
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,440
Next group.

394
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,520
Basketball Robot High Show.

395
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,640
Let’s go. It’s our turn.

396
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,480
On your feet!

397
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,400
Come on!

398
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,600
I’ve watched your dance.

399
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,920
There’s no teamwork at all.

400
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,080
But Chen Guoguo, individually,

401
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,720
your performance was good.

402
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,880
So, I decided to

403
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,280
let you go for the gala

404
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,760
on behalf of our class.

405
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,840
Mr. Wen.

406
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,040
I don’t wanna go alone.

407
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,840
Lu Miao, Shi Che, Xie Ziye.

408
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,600
They also did a lot for this dance.

409
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,280
We just didn’t rehearse well.

410
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,920
We’ll rehearse

411
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,440
and it’ll be completely different.

412
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,480
I promise.

413
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,400
Mr. Wen.

414
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,240
They are my best friends.

415
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,480
By this dance,

416
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,000
we wanna leave a wonderful memory

417
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,120
in our youth.

418
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,360
You need to support us.

419
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,080
Also,

420
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,600
Lu Miao and Shi Che will

421
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,200
spend a lot of time on the rehearsal.

422
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,080
You can relax as well.

423
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,800
Mr. Wen.

424
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,480
Okay.

425
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,480
I believe you.

426
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,520
That said,

427
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,960
you must practice harder

428
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,640
before the gala.

429
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,040
Don’t disgrace our class.

430
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,080
Yes, you have my word!

431
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,760
Good luck.

432
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,200
We really screwed it up.

433
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,480
That was expected.

434
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,800
Don’t be so pessimistic.

435
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,880
We’ll have a gala next year.

436
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:17,338
Guys.

437
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,600
Our dance

438
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,240
was chosen!

439
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,560
What? How is that possible?

440
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,240
Yes. Mr. Wen asked us to practice hard

441
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,600
and win honor for the class.

442
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,720
Are we so lucky?

443
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,000
We made it!

444
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,840
Great!

445
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,960
Is it so-called protagonist privilege?

446
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,120
Go.

447
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,280
Jiang Haoyue, the program list is out.

448
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,240
I wanna discuss with you

449
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,440
about the host script.

450
00:18:13,506 --> 00:18:14,186
Wait for me.

451
00:18:15,781 --> 00:18:16,701
It’s gonna be late.

452
00:18:18,371 --> 00:18:18,971
Go.

453
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:21,562
I’m going first.

454
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,760
We did well today,

455
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:34,812
but I think the script should
be revised.

456
00:18:35,253 --> 00:18:35,773
Right?

457
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,160
Okay.

458
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,560
Jiang, do you have any idea
about the costume?

459
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,840
I have a white shirt.

460
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,120
White shirt is good.

461
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,920
How come she’s still with him?

462
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,280
It must look good on you.

463
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,200
A tie is also very important.

464
00:18:56,653 --> 00:18:57,773
Do you have a tie?

465
00:18:59,712 --> 00:19:00,352
No.

466
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,610
It doesn’t matter.

467
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,240
I’m gonna rent costumes
for my classmates.

468
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,080
I can rent some ties for you.

469
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:08,691
No, thanks.

470
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,210
We should prepare meticulously.

471
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:14,780
Hey.

472
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,000
You boys never care about these things.

473
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,000
Let me see what kind of ties suit you.

474
00:19:26,243 --> 00:19:27,843
Black ones suit you better.

475
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,800
What do you think?

476
00:19:37,096 --> 00:19:37,776
What is it?

477
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,880
I can rent a tie myself.

478
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,240
Bye.

479
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,280
Miao.

480
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,080
You know.

481
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,080
Your mom is out for business,

482
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,400
while we are idle at home.

483
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,840
It’s not appropriate, right?

484
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,280
You must be hungry.

485
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,240
How about

486
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,920
we go to a restaurant with Jiang?

487
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,640
I won’t.

488
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,360
He might’ve had dinner.

489
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,640
I’m not hungry.

490
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,520
My mom will buy meals back.

491
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,600
I don’t wanna go out.

492
00:20:16,593 --> 00:20:17,553
Are you all right, Miao?

493
00:20:18,231 --> 00:20:19,551
Are you at odds with Jiang?

494
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,360
Nope.

495
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,120
It’s not about him.

496
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,760
Dad.

497
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,400
Our school is gonna
hold the New Year Gala.

498
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,640
I will perform.

499
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,240
What will you perform?

500
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:37,920
The four of us

501
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,160
will integrate a scientist,

502
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,040
robots, basketball,

503
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,000
these three things

504
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,480
into a dance.

505
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,320
Popping dance?

506
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,600
You got the right person.

507
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,400
What do you mean?

508
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,760
I was nicknamed Popping Dance King

509
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,680
in the school.

510
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,680
Really?

511
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,760
Yes.

512
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,040
Come on.

513
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,040
Dad, teach me.

514
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,520
Come on.

515
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,280
Let me teach you.

516
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,680
Robot.

517
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,280
Stay still.

518
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:06,760
Go back.

519
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,560
Dad. Do it slowly.

520
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,880
Wait. Dad.

521
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,680
Your dance

522
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,600
doesn’t feel like popping dance.

523
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,840
It’s more like disco for the elder.

524
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,520
Of course not.

525
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,960
This is the disco for the elder.

526
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,480
Your mom is back early.

527
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,080
Hurry. I’ll tidy the dining table.

528
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:27,760
You, the coffee table.

529
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,880
Hurry.

530
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,480
Miao. Hurry.

531
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:32,680
Okay.

532
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,440
Hurry.

533
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,960
Coming.

534
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,200
Uncle Lu.

535
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,760
Jiang.

536
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,840
Come on in.

537
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,240
I’m here for Miao. Is she at home?

538
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,240
Yes.

539
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,080
Miao.

540
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,240
Jiang is here for you.

541
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,600
No!

542
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,880
What’s with her temper?

543
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,760
She’ll be fine after some sleep.

544
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,280
Never mind. I’m going home to rest.

545
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,160
Good night, Uncle Lu.

546
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,960
Take care.

547
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,640
Okay. I’m on my way.

548
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,560
Uncle Lu.

549
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,760
Morning.

550
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,600
Jiang.

551
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,320
Are you waiting for Miao?

552
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,800
She has left.

553
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,280
Didn’t she call you?

554
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,760
No.

555
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,800
Look.

556
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,640
Let me drive you to school.

557
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,240
No. It’s early.

558
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,440
I still have time.

559
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,200
I’m leaving.

560
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,640
What possessed you to do this?

561
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,200
What do you mean?

562
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,680
Studying here so early

563
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,080
isn’t your style.

564
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,280
You come in time.

565
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:53,920
Check this.

566
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,920
Did I write the equation right?

567
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,920
Doesn’t Jiang Haoyue

568
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,840
usually check it for you?

569
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,560
He’s been very busy.

570
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,400
I don’t wanna bother him.

571
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,080
Your tongue sounds jealous.

572
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,120
Is it because of

573
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,520
his partner Su Daifei?

574
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,640
Don’t mention them.

575
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,480
No need.

576
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,520
Many people like Jiang Haoyue,

577
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,960
but he likes none of them.

578
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,600
This time is different.

579
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,360
Yesterday ,

580
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,200
I saw Su Daifei touched him,

581
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,240
yet he didn’t even refuse.

582
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,360
Touch?

583
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,680
That intimate?

584
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,480
Does he have feelings for her?

585
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,640
Look, Che.

586
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,880
I’ve designed a new move.

587
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,560
Look.

588
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:42,920
This is good.

589
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,680
How about we rotate the ball?

590
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,120
Like this.

591
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,920
Guoguo, you are amazing!

592
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,560
That’s easy.

593
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,800
I can do it, too.

594
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,520
I’m good.

595
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,720
It’s kung fu.

596
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,200
Save it.

597
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,800
Is that kung fu?

598
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,680
Shame on you.

599
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,320
I practiced when I was little,

600
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,840
I’m out of practice now.

601
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,880
Miao.

602
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,720
Have a try.

603
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,080
Like this?

604
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,440
From below.

605
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,200
Like this.

606
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,240
Jiang Haoyue is incredibly cool.

607
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,360
Daifei. Can you get his autograph

608
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,480
for me?

609
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,760
Why do you want his autograph?

610
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,520
It’s the end of the term.

611
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,600
I want it

612
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,320
to inspire me for the exams.

613
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,240
Okay. I’ll ask him about it.

614
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,400
Daifei, I’m envious that

615
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,680
you can rehearse with him.

616
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,120
Yes. Me too.

617
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,280
Delete his photos you shot secretly!

618
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,080
I didn’t shoot secretly.

619
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,520
You are lying!

620
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,120
Why are you so angry?

621
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,240
Does she like Jiang Haoyue?

622
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,160
But Jiang sees her as his sister.

623
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:52,960
No.

624
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,040
That’s not true.

625
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,240
He isn’t my brother!

626
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,920
It’s normal that you are anxious.

627
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,440
Don’t worry.

628
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,080
You’ll soon get used to it.

629
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,760
Bye.

630
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,600
Hello, sir.

631
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:13,920
Hello.

632
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,880
Lu Miao.

633
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,000
What are you doing?

634
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,000
I’m practicing tap dancing.

635
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,000
Hello, sir.

636
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,280
Add a line before this program.

637
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,240
What’s wrong with it?

638
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,320
Good.

639
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,800
This is the time we agreed upon.

640
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,520
Right.

641
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,280
Regain your strength.

642
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,920
We’ll go home late these days.

643
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,720
I don’t eat this.

644
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,960
Hey!

645
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,480
Sorry.

646
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,400
We scheduled to practice here at five.

647
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,000
Really?

648
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,480
My schedule is at five, too.

649
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,240
It’s approved by different teachers.

650
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,760
No wonder the time conflicts.

651
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,640
What to do now?

652
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,000
Let them use it.

653
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,400
Let us?

654
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,120
There’s no need.

655
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,520
Hey.

656
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,160
I have a good idea.

657
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,600
This classroom is big.

658
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,880
We can occupy a half each.

659
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,120
Yes.

660
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,600
Distinguished leaders.

661
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,280
Dear teachers, classmates”.

662
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,280
Happy New Year.

663
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,080
Welcome to

664
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,480
the New Year Gala of
Nanfeng No. 1 High School.

665
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,880
How time flies.
It’s been a wonderful year.

666
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,720
Come.

667
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,480
Meng, let me teach you.

668
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,240
Do it together.

669
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,720
Two, two, three, four.

670
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,840
In an instant,
it’s time to say goodbye...

671
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,800
Five, six, seven, eight.

672
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,120
Three, two, three.

673
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,080
Meng.

674
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,440
I can’t hear the music. Turn it up.

675
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,720
Thanks to Luo Mengjie
from Class 5, Grade 1.

676
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,000
What about now?

677
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,120
OK.

678
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Let me show you again.

679
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,160
Five, six, seven, eight.

680
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,320
Two, two, three, four.

681
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,640
I can’t do it. Show me again.

682
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,520
Let me show you.

683
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,320
Five, six, seven, eight.

684
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,400
The lovers are rowing a boat.

685
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,920
Five, six, seven, eight.

686
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,440
Two, two, three, four.

687
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,120
Five, six, seven, eight.

688
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,480
It’s like this here.

689
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,560
Three, two, three, four.

690
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,680
Five, six, seven, eight.

691
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,760
Jiang Haoyue, wait for me!

692
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,560
Can you do it now?

693
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,040
Our products

694
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,480
boast a great advantage

695
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,880
on price-performance ratio.

696
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,880
It’s true.

697
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,320
Let me tell you.

698
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,120
Rest assured.

699
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:12,640
What’s wrong?

700
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,680
We’ll talk about the discount.

701
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,160
Really.

702
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,120
The quality

703
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,240
is exclusive.

704
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:17,840
The price is...

705
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,680
Wash your hands.
Get ready for dinner.

706
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,520
I cooked the dishes today.

707
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,600
Don’t hesitate.

708
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,880
You may consider it.

709
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,000
Be sure to tell me

710
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,040
before 9 o’clock.

711
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,000
Be sure to tell me then.

712
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,720
Go wash your hands.

713
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,400
This product is very popular now.

714
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,720
Okay.

715
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,400
I’ll call you later.

716
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,960
Okay.

717
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,480
What are you doing?

718
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,120
Practice Qigong?

719
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,520
Go ahead.

720
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,840
Call Jiang here for dinner.

721
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,320
I won’t call him!

722
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,920
Many girls treat him to dinner.

723
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,240
He won’t come!

724
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,840
Why are you so mad?

725
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,040
What are you angry for?

726
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,040
Isn’t my cooking good?

727
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,880
Mr. Liu.

728
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,560
I’d like to ask you about the price

729
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,640
of math cram classes.

730
00:29:01,293 --> 00:29:02,003
After you.

731
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,520
Childish.

732
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,080
Hope you like the hair pin.

733
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,120
Didn’t your brother tell you?

734
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,600
We bought that hair pin together.

735
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,040
I know.

736
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,400
This girlish thing

737
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,320
doesn’t suit me.

738
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,160
You better keep it.

739
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,920
After all, he bought it for you.

740
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,940
(Class 1, Grade 2)

741
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:51,800
What’s wrong?

742
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,480
Su Daifei chose it!
I don’t want it!

743
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,360
Take it back.

744
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,600
Is she Jiang Haoyue’s sister?

745
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,800
They are arguing.

746
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,400
Let’s talk at home.

747
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,240
Don’t you go home!

748
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,400
You hear that?

749
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,480
So loud.

750
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,640
She told him not to go home.

751
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,760
Jiang Haoyue ended up like this.

752
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,240
Who could expect that?

753
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,640
What’s their relationship exactly?

754
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,280
I’m not upset!

755
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,120
He can be close to anyone.

756
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,840
What is it got to do with me?

757
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,880
We are just

758
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,160
childhood friends.

759
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,320
Gazing for ten seconds
can’t prove anything!

760
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,160
Just a hair pin.

761
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,720
It’s no big deal.

762
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,920
It’s not worth being upset!

763
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,640
I hate Jiang Haoyue!

764
00:31:09,664 --> 00:31:19,664

766
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,160
My dad said you’d return to school.

767
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,800
Yes.

768
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,640
Great!

769
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,640
We can go to school together now!

770
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,480
What are you reading?

771
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,760
Your hands are dirty.

772
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,400
Alright. They’re clean now.

773
00:31:52,134 --> 00:31:54,160
I’m reading Journey to the West.

774
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,760
And you got it away.

775
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,760
Can you understand it?

776
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,280
Of course.

777
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,800
No, you certainly can’t.

778
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,040
You are in Grade 2.

779
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:04,368
I’m in Grade 3.

780
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,320
I’m always one grade higher than you.

781
00:32:07,496 --> 00:32:08,602
I can understand it,

782
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,200
but you can’t.

783
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,560
That’s not true!

784
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,960
I know Journey to the West.

785
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,728
I watched it on TV two days ago.

786
00:32:15,728 --> 00:32:18,968
There were White Bone Spirit,
Gold Kid, Silver Kid,

787
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,200
and...

788
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,725
It’s Golden Horn Demon King
and Silver Horn Demon King.

789
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,600
Alright. I didn’t watch it.

790
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,200
I don’t know Journey to the West.

791
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,840
You can ask me about Ultraman Tiga.

792
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,120
The Ultra-Ancient Monster Gorzan.

793
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,440
Rock Monster Gakuma.

794
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,920
Do you know these?

795
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,800
You are in Grade 3,
yet you don’t know them.

796
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,520
Why don’t you

797
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,880
teach me to read?

798
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,640
I don’t know it.

799
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,240
It’s 6 o’clock!

800
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,880
It begins!

801
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,960
Miao, come to eat.
It’s delicious.

802
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,000
I’ll eat after this show.

803
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,480
Hurry. Come to eat.

804
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,240
Hurry up.

805
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,240
It’s getting cold.

806
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,440
I’ll eat them up.

807
00:33:08,628 --> 00:33:09,348
I’m watching

808
00:33:09,378 --> 00:33:10,858
my favorite Journey to the West!

809
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,160
Miao.

810
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,880
Isn’t Ultraman your favorite?

811
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,360
I don’t like that.

812
