<i>Eternal Regret</i>

30
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,320
Is it straight?

31
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:49,920
No, it’s not.

32
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,760
The right side is a bit low.

33
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,480
A little bit.

34
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,040
The right side.

35
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,280
Can’t you differentiate right and left?

36
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,360
This is the right side.

37
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,080
Do it yourself.

38
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,160
I told you it’s too low.

39
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,960
Look at them.

40
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,640
This...

41
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,720
This is straight.

42
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,200
Look at our daughter’s exam ranking.

43
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,200
The number is so auspicious.

44
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
Eighty-eight.

45
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,920
It means great fortune.

46
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,600
Okay. I’ll go all out next time.

47
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,920
Yes. Great.

48
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,560
But keep the good work up.

49
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,280
Don’t be too proud.

50
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,860
Mom.

51
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,900
I finally got into top 100.

52
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,080
Can’t you just praise me?

53
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,200
Praise you?

54
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,320
I’d better praise Jiang.

55
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,720
Without him, you can’t achieve this.

56
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,520
But kids shouldn’t

57
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,900
study too hard.

58
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,100
Most importantly,

59
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,000
she needs to balance study and rest.

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,520
Right.

61
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,240
Studying hard is
the most important thing.

62
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,540
Miao,

63
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,900
your mom didn’t study diligently

64
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,240
when she was supposed to.

65
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,320
Look how tiring her work is now.

66
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:40,880
Mom.

67
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,880
You’re mistaken.

68
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,840
It’s him.

69
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,360
You...!

70
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,960
Mom.

71
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,280
It turned out that
you didn’t like study either.

72
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,000
Fine.

73
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,880
It’s rare that we come here.

74
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,980
When we’re here,

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,800
Miao

76
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,720
doesn’t need to study.

77
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,920
Hang out with us, okay?

78
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,760
Thank you, Grandpa!

79
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,720
If you’re half as good as Jiang,

80
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,040
I won’t have to worry so much.

81
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,840
Where is Jiang?

82
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,320
I haven’t seen him for a while.

83
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,240
He should be downstairs.

84
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,640
I’ll go get him.

85
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,840
- Be careful.
- Come back soon.

86
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,440
Okay.

87
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,520
Jiang.

88
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,960
This is odd.

89
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,380
Why isn’t he at home
during the Spring Festival?

90
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,960
Sorry, the number you dialed
is out of service.

91
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,080
Out of service?

92
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,360
Go.

93
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,800
Don’t do such dishonest things again.

94
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,600
You’re a father.

95
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,680
You should also act like one.

96
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,560
Go home and spend the Spring Festival
with your son.

97
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,320
Well.

98
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:47,920
Do you have alcohol?

99
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,840
Alcohol?

100
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,920
You haven’t spent enough time
in jail, right?

101
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,000
No.

102
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,080
Look. That was the only money I had.

103
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,680
You confiscated it as gambling money.

104
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,120
I can’t go home with empty pockets
during the Spring Festival, right?

105
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,880
Yi,

106
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,640
you can’t live like this from now on.

107
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,480
Jiang Haoyue is a kid
with much potential.

108
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,280
Aren’t you afraid that

109
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
he might look down on you
in the future?

110
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,440
I’m his father.

111
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,240
I gave him life and raised him up.

112
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,200
If he dares to look down on me...

113
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,200
You...

114
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:20,820
This is it.

115
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,560
If he dares to look down on me,

116
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,160
do you think I’ll spare him?

117
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:25,960
Don’t talk big.

118
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,680
Why are you here?

119
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,240
Slow down.

120
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,080
I’m talking to you.

121
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,920
Slow down.

122
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,400
Do you have money in your WeChat wallet?

123
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,520
Transfer 100 yuan to me.

124
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,120
50.

125
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,360
50 will do.

126
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,040
Hurry.

127
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
My mom is right.

128
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,080
You’re a jerk.

129
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,240
Who is a jerk?

130
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,160
I mean you are.

131
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,560
Do you want to get beaten?

132
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,440
If I’m a jerk,

133
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,840
how can you grow so tall?

134
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,960
If I’m a jerk,

135
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,320
how can you be
the No.1 student at school?

136
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,460
Whether I’m No.1 or not

137
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,480
is none of your business.

138
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,600
Then it’s whose business?

139
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,200
It’s Lu Yongfei’s business?

140
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,520
It’s the business of the bastard

141
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,000
who crippled you, right?

142
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,000
You really wish to be his son, right?

143
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Just go if you want to.

144
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,820
Enjoy being a gambler.

145
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,840
You’re on your own.

146
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,720
What do you understand?

147
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,480
How can I stand a chance
if I don’t gamble?

148
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,640
Your mom, Chen Lu abandoned us

149
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,520
and ran away with some other guy

150
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,600
because I didn’t have money.

151
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,800
Do you understand it?

152
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,800
Leave me alone.

153
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,800
No one will spend
the Spring Festival with you.

154
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,000
Go mind your own business.

155
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,360
Happy New Year.

156
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,280
Happy New Year.

157
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,080
Why are you home so late?

158
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,600
I...

159
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,200
I went out for shopping.

160
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,240
What are you here for?

161
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,240
I’m waiting for you.

162
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,480
I called you but you didn’t answer.

163
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,260
Today is the Spring Festival.

164
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,380
Why don’t you wear a festive outfit?

165
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,920
Outfit is not enough.

166
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,720
To have a festive look,

167
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,600
I need to put on buns

168
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,520
like yours.

169
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,520
Do you know how hard it is
to make these?

170
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,480
I spent hours to do these buns.

171
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,880
And you find them not pretty?

172
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,880
I didn’t say they’re not pretty.

173
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,360
They’re quite cute.

174
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,320
Come to my home.

175
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,400
We have a feast tonight.

176
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,880
Grandma asked me to invite both

177
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,920
you and Uncle Jiang to dinner.

178
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,680
He...

179
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,760
He won’t come home tonight.

180
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,440
That’s his loss.

181
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,520
Let’s have dinner together.

182
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,480
I even bought sparklers.

183
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,000
We can play with fireworks tonight.

184
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,880
Don’t say I’m childish
for playing with fireworks.

185
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:31,960
Okay.

186
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,240
Let’s go.

187
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,560
- Where’s the cut?
- Keep watching.

188
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,200
This...

189
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,120
Let me cook the dinner.

190
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,040
What’s going on?

191
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,920
I asked you to cook but you didn’t.

192
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,080
You were slacking off.

193
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,520
Great. Now I’m cut.

194
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,640
Let me treat your wound.

195
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,400
No need.

196
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,480
- Her face is so pale.
- Give her a hand.

197
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,280
She doesn’t have the festive vibe.

198
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,960
- Grandma, Grandpa, Jiang is here.
- It’s fine. It’s fine.

199
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,120
Jiang is here.

200
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,560
Let me take a look.

201
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,040
You’re taller.

202
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,920
You’re more and more handsome.

203
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,040
Come.

204
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,720
Let me.

205
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,400
It’s fine.

206
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,560
You bled a lot.

207
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,640
It’s fine.

208
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,040
You seem to be

209
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,240
not so busy this year.

210
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,880
What do you mean?

211
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,720
Well.

212
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,760
Every other year,
during the Spring Festival,

213
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,360
weren’t you always busy
calling your clients?

214
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,760
I did this

215
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,080
intentionally to save this time

216
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,640
to accompany the family.

217
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:42,960
It’s the Spring Festival.

218
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,120
You still want me to work?

219
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,520
Fine. I need to

220
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,960
call my client now.

221
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,440
You reminded me.

222
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,000
Medicine kit.

223
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,040
Don’t forget to put it back.

224
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,260
Hello.

225
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,000
Happy New Year.

226
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,080
I’m just calling to ask you,

227
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,360
when will the company
pay year-end bonus?

228
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,660
I originally planned to
tell you after the Spring Festival.

229
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,100
You’re an old employee.

230
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,660
But your performance hasn’t
been so good for the past few years.

231
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,000
The company now wishes to

232
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,160
terminate the labor contract with you.

233
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,320
Are you saying that

234
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,920
I’m fired?

235
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,280
I’m really sorry.

236
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,600
I promise I’ll try to
persuade the company

237
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,720
to give you a month’s salary
as compensation.

238
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,680
Dad.

239
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,480
Well.

240
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,960
Is mom a bit gloomy today?

241
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,320
Is she?

242
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,240
I saw her spend the whole day

243
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,000
in the room today.

244
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,520
During every Spring Festival,

245
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,280
your mom will call her old clients.

246
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,960
That’s how she manages her relations.

247
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,080
She might be tired.

248
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,200
She’s taking some rest.

249
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,360
It’s fine, Miao.

250
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,440
Today’s Taiping Swallow

251
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,080
is handmade by your Grandma.

252
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,200
It’s your mom’s favorite.

253
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,240
She will be thrilled tonight
when she sees it.

254
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,280
Dad, don’t stop.

255
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,440
Grandma said you mustn’t stop.

256
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,720
If you stop, the meat won’t be tender.

257
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:57,800
I can’t stop.

258
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,160
I can’t stop.

259
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,440
Miao.

260
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,040
This is so fun.

261
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,120
Do you want to try it?

262
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,040
It’s like drumming.

263
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,320
Come. Try it.

264
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,720
Have a try.

265
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,280
Isn’t this fun?

266
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,720
Don’t stop.

267
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,480
Grandma said, if you stop,

268
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,200
the meat won’t be tender.

269
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,200
Don’t stop.

270
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,560
I was talking to you
to distract my attention.

271
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,320
Dad, this is so fun.

272
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,520
Do you want to have a try?

273
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,440
The swing is so fun.

274
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,660
Check me out.

275
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,440
Follow me.

276
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,280
The other side.

277
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,400
Do this.

278
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,440
And this.

279
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,080
Great.

280
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,480
You’re so smart.

281
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,720
You learned it so fast.

282
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,160
Grandma taught me well.

283
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,520
Is your dad at home?

284
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,400
Call him here for dinner tonight, okay?

285
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,200
He’s not at home.

286
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,960
Not home?

287
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,040
Honey.

288
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,560
It’s the Spring Festival.
Have some wine too.

289
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,920
Okay.

290
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,280
What’s going on?

291
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,320
You have a rough time at work?

292
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,520
No.

293
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,360
I got a lot of year-end bonus.

294
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,440
Mom, did you hear that?

295
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,680
She has received bonus.

296
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,840
I told you so.

297
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,840
My wife is the best.

298
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,840
We can definitely

299
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,040
enjoy a good Spring Festival.

300
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,560
Yes.

301
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,120
Here comes Taiping Swallow.

302
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,660
Come. Slow down.

303
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,160
Without Taiping Swallow,
there’s no Spring Festival feast.

304
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,440
Taiping Swallow is necessary
for Spring Festival.

305
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,720
I haven’t eaten
mom’s Taiping Swallow for a while.

306
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,640
Thankfully, Miao and Jiang
were there to help me.

307
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,480
Look.

308
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,720
It looks so good.

309
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,920
Come on. Eat.

310
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,720
Thanks, mom.

311
00:12:59,440 --> 00:12:59,800
How is it?

312
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,120
Is it great?

313
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,040
It’s delicious.

314
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,760
It’s the taste of childhood.

315
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,920
I finally see her smile.

316
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,560
Mom.

317
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,160
You must be happy
during the Spring Festival.

318
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,400
I’m happy.

319
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,560
I’m old now.

320
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,640
I want nothing more.

321
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,720
I just want the family

322
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,040
to be safe and happy.

323
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,720
Right?

324
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,680
Mom is right.

325
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,160
Because of what mom just said,

326
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,160
we need to spend the Spring Festival

327
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,800
safely and happily.

328
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,200
Cheers.

329
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,720
Come.

330
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,520
Happy New Year.

331
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,720
It’s lit.

332
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,720
Jiang, look at the camera.

333
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,440
Let me take photos.

334
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,080
Okay.

335
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,440
Watch out.

336
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,640
Look.

337
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,600
Happy New Year.

338
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,080
What’s your New Year wish?

339
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,040
My New Year wish is that

340
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,400
I hope everyone

341
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,240
can be happy and

342
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,160
we can all be together.

343
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,320
It died out.

344
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,040
Let me take it. Be careful. It’s hot.

345
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,480
Sit down first.

346
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,160
I have something to share with you.

347
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,640
This.

348
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,280
This is the rice wine
I just got from Grandma.

349
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,080
I sneaked a sip on the dinner table.

350
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,280
It’s so good.
It tastes like beverage.

351
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,320
Have a try.

352
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,720
High school students shouldn’t drink.

353
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,280
The ancient sages have said

354
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,600
rice wine is not wine.

355
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,640
High school students can drink it too.

356
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,280
Don’t drink too much.

357
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,360
It’s a call from Ziye.

358
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,000
Happy New Year, Miao.

359
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,680
Happy New Year.

360
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,040
I’m talking with Miao.

361
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,880
What are you here for?

362
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,720
We’re in the same chat group.
We can’t send our New Year wishes?

363
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,040
It’s lively when we’re together.

364
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,120
Right, Che?

365
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,240
Mr. Jiang would like to
send his New Year wishes too.

366
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,000
Happy New Year.

367
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,640
Jiang Haoyue.

368
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,800
Why are you hanging out with Meng?

369
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,520
We’re playing with fireworks
on the rooftop.

370
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,640
Give the phone to Meng.

371
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,480
I want to see her.

372
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:25,880
Meng.

373
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,640
Haven’t you said
you’ll send New Year wishes?

374
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,080
Happy New Year, Haoyue.

375
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,960
Happy New Year, Haoyue.

376
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,840
I’m not happy.

377
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,880
Happy New Year.

378
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,600
You...

379
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,400
Come drink rice wine with me.

380
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,000
It’s so delicious.

381
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,760
Jiang Haoyue, you let Meng drink?

382
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,040
What are you drinking?

383
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,440
Miao is one of a kind.

384
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,640
She’s indeed special.

385
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,920
Jiang Haoyue.

386
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,200
Stop shaking me.

387
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,080
You drank too much?

388
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,320
I didn’t shake you.

389
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,120
You seem to be wasted.

390
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,440
You’re so funny.

391
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,240
The way when you’re drunk...

392
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,960
- I’ll go now. She’s drunk.
- Is pretty ugly.

393
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,680
- I’ll send her home.
- Bye-bye.

394
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,320
Stop drinking.

395
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,680
What?

396
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,120
I’m not drunk.

397
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,000
Look.

398
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,960
Be careful.

399
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,760
I can walk.

400
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,240
Watch out. I can!

401
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,400
I can...!

402
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,200
Let me answer a call.

403
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,280
Call?

404
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,640
Is it from that annoying Su Daifei?

405
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,160
It’s Qu Wei.

406
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,160
Qu Wei?

407
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,680
You mustn’t answer his call.

408
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,640
When we were at school,

409
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,680
I saw you two

410
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,160
flirting with your eyes.

411
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,320
Answer me.

412
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,040
You used our relationship

413
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,240
to cover something, right?

414
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,800
What’s the thing
that you like about him?

415
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,000
I see.

416
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,720
Do you like

417
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,400
those who’re good at study?

418
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,760
Can you change your preference?

419
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,920
Studying is too hard.

420
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,280
Be quite. Aunt and Uncle are sleeping.

421
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,040
Do you know?

422
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,120
Actually,

423
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,440
I have a lot of

424
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,400
other virtues.

425
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,520
Yes.

426
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,720
I’m good at playing video games.

427
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,520
Look.

428
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,280
Check me out. A flash.

429
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,040
A slowdown.

430
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,840
A combo.

431
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,920
First blood.

432
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,320
Defend the Nexus.

433
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,280
Where’s the Nexus?

434
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,040
Where’s your key?

435
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,840
Key?

436
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,640
Don’t move.

437
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,840
Come. I’ll take you home.

438
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,280
Jiang Haoyue.

439
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,640
Why

440
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,320
did you

441
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,080
get the moon down?

442
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,400
You’re drunk.

443
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,280
Let me take you home.

444
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,200
You haven’t told me.

445
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,320
Why did you

446
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,840
get the moon down?

447
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,920
To give it to you.

448
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,960
You really like me.

449
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,520
If you like me, then you should say it.

450
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,840
Only if you say it,

451
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,760
can we know

452
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,760
each other’s feelings.

453
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,720
Only if you say it,

454
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,800
can we know each other’s feelings.

455
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,700
<i>Mom</i>

456
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,240
Can you give it to dad later, okay?

457
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,340
Don’t eat sweet things.

458
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,100
Why should a boy eat so many sweet food?

459
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,040
Look. What is it?

460
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,240
Isn’t it pretty?

461
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:09,840
What is it?

462
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,840
He likes small toy cars.

463
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,920
You’re spoiling him.

464
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,920
Give it to me.

465
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,880
Red.

466
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,600
Black and white.

467
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,240
Come. Let me take a look.

468
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,480
Is it done?

469
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,400
Come. Sit tight.

470
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,280
Sit together.

471
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,920
Men need to support the family.
Do you get it?

472
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,160
Look.

473
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:33,880
What do we have left

474
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,000
in the fridge?

475
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,720
We need to live and feed ourselves.

476
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,400
This costs money,

477
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,340
doesn’t it?

478
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,320
You despise me now?

479
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,920
Yes, I do.

480
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,040
Listen up. I’m also regretful.

481
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,640
What’s your problem?

482
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,560
You’re the one who has a problem.

483
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,600
Just piss off if you can’t live with me.

484
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,920
Mom.

485
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,960
Mom.

486
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,400
Mom.

487
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,720
Come. Give me your hand.

488
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,240
Keep it.

489
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Haoyue.

490
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,240
Remember my words.

491
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,920
Mom will come back.

492
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,160
I’ll definitely come back.

493
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,560
You’re a man. Don’t cry.

494
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,280
Do you know that?

495
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:11,000
Mom.

496
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,140
Happy New Year.

497
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,080
Happy New Year.

498
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,040
I wanted to call you last night.

499
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,200
But your brother had an upset stomach
and didn’t feel too well.

500
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,360
When he was feeling better,
it was already past midnight.

501
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,480
I thought you must be sleeping.

502
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,560
So...

503
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,800
It’s fine.

504
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,920
I slept early last night.

505
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,880
How are you doing recently?

506
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,960
I’m doing great.

507
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,880
Jiang Yi didn’t cause
any trouble to you, right?

508
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:24,800
What are you doing?

509
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,920
You’re stealthily calling
your mom again, right?

510
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,560
Does it have anything to do with you?

511
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,160
Jiang.

512
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,880
Have you been waiting for a while?

513
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,040
Grandpa.

514
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,560
This.

515
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,040
I don’t understand
this youngsters’ gadget.

516
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,720
Let Jiang teach me how to use a phone.

517
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,640
How to use it?

518
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,880
Here.

519
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,240
No one wants your crap.

520
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,680
Jiang.

521
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,000
Red packet. Take it.

522
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,640
I can’t take it.

523
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,480
Miao also has hers.

524
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,760
I didn’t tell her mom and dad.

525
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,480
You’re the same.

526
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,240
You mustn’t let them know.

527
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,240
If they know,
they’ll definitely say this.

528
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,760
Give it to me. Let me keep it for you.

529
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,160
I’ll return it to you when you grow up.

530
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,520
It’s a lie.

531
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:09,800
Take it.

532
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,100
Remember?

533
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,640
Thank you, Grandpa.

534
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,480
Don’t starve yourself.

535
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,320
Don’t starve yourself at school.

536
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,360
- Okay.
- Miao.

537
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,340
Miao.

538
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,720
Whether you’re good at study or not
isn’t important.

539
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,720
There are many paths in life.

540
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,280
Get in the car.

541
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,320
Grandma, watch your head.

542
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,760
What did your grandpa just tell you?

543
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,440
He told me nothing.

544
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,160
Don’t pull this trick.

545
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,520
Do you remember what I told you?

546
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,560
Yes, I do.

547
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,640
Repeat it for me.

548
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,080
First, keep the windows
and doors closed.

549
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,800
Second, tidy the washed clothes.

550
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,840
Third, check the sockets.

551
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,280
Fourth, beware of water-heater.

552
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,280
I remember it, mom.

553
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,440
We’ll just be away for two days.

554
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,840
Have you finished?

555
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,880
Go. Get in the car. Hurry.

556
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,760
I’ll miss you.

557
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,800
I feel there’s something I forgot.

558
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,800
Hurry and get in the car.

559
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,320
Oh!

560
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,200
Recently, there’s mad cow disease.

561
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,080
Don’t eat spicy hot pot.

562
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,840
I get it.

563
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,160
I definitely won’t eat it.

564
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,340
I spent a long time
looking for my notebook.

565
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,880
Get in the car.

566
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,520
Watch out for your leg.

567
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,160
Right.

568
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,100
If I hadn’t stopped your mom...

569
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,000
What are you whispering about?

570
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Nothing.

571
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,320
I was reminding her again.

572
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,040
Bye-bye.

573
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,760
Bye-bye.

574
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,340
Have a safe trip.

575
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,480
Remember what I told you.

576
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,120
- Yes, I’ll definitely tell you.
- Tidy the clothes. No spicy hot pot.

577
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,040
Miao.

578
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,480
Bye.

579
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,640
- Have a safe trip. Bye.
- Take care of yourself.

580
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,040
I’m free.

581
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,800
Fang.

582
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,960
She has grown up.

583
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,160
Don’t worry.

584
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,520
He drove off before
I could finish my words.

585
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,200
You.

586
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,600
It’s fine. We’ll only be gone
for a few days.

587
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,100
Miao is a good child.

588
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,320
Don’t worry about her.

589
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,920
Lu.

590
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,080
Weather broadcast said
that it would rain today.

591
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,340
Drive slowly.

592
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,200
Don’t worry, dad.

593
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,560
Sir.

594
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,160
What do you want?

595
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,880
I want

596
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,920
beef sausage, coin sausage,

597
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,160
chicken sausage, bacon, fish tofu,

598
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,240
quail egg, and lettuce each.

599
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,040
You eat that much.

600
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,560
Okay. Wait a second.

601
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,440
It’ll be ready soon.

602
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,880
Sir, put more chili for me.

603
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,680
Okay. Wait a second.

604
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,660
<i>Time Book</i>

605
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:41,200
We’re playing with fireworks on rooftop.

606
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,280
I want to set off fireworks
with Meng as well.

607
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,560
What’s going on?

608
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,160
You argued with your friend?

609
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,240
No.

610
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,960
Meng

611
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,880
is a lovely nickname.

612
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,520
It’s the name of the girl you like?

613
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,720
Tell me.

614
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,080
What type of boys do girls like?

615
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,480
Of course, those who’re humorous

616
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,880
and have high EQ.

617
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,800
EQ?

618
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,640
Well.

619
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,680
How can I tell the level of my EQ?

620
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,720
Let me give you a test.

621
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,800
If a girl

622
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,520
says goodnight to you,

623
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,480
how will you respond?

624
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,080
I’ll of course say

625
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,520
goodnight.

626
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,280
Wrong.

627
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,760
You should say

628
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,080
let’s sleep together.

629
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,080
I’m tired.

630
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,000
Have a sweet dream.

631
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,520
Amazing.

632
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,640
Tell me more.

633
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,600
I need to improve my EQ.

634
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,120
Sit well.

635
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,720
If a girl tells you that

636
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,840
today’s weather is good,

637
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,240
how will you respond?

638
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:45,800
You’re right.

639
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,080
The weather is great.

640
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,880
The sun is shining.

641
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,160
Wrong.

642
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,440
You should say
since today’s weather is great,

643
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,160
we should go on a date together.

644
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,760
Great.

645
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,320
Tell me more.

646
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,440
It’s so useful.

647
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,000
I need to take notes.

648
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,480
It’s raining outside.

649
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,280
A girl tells you that

650
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,440
you should remember
to bring the umbrella.

651
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,280
How will you respond?

652
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,240
Thank you for your concern.

653
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,160
I’ll walk you home.

654
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,520
That will do.

655
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,280
But it’s not good enough.

656
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,160
You should say

657
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,480
you’re so sweet.

658
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,600
You seem to be the type that

659
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,480
makes a good wife.

660
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,000
The mentor can only teach you so much.

661
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,280
You need to practice your skills
on your own.

662
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,200
For these questions,

663
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,400
you need to draw inferences
from one instance.

664
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,000
Also, you can find

665
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,140
a friend of the opposite sex

666
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,340
to practice more.

667
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,360
Hello, beauty.

668
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,800
How’s the weather?

669
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,840
Psycho.

670
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:10,840
I want to return the book.

671
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,920
Chlorophyll.

672
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,640
Why are you here?

673
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,560
I should be the one who asks this.

674
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,600
- Isn’t it normal that I’m in a bookstore?
- Bye.

675
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,440
Ziye.

676
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,520
I have a question for you.

677
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,040
Go on. Which test?

678
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,240
No.

679
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,720
It’s...

680
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,040
Which book...

681
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,120
Which book do you think is the best?

682
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,520
The best?

683
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,360
That’s hard to say.

684
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,680
But, for you, the best book

685
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,640
should be children’s books.

686
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,720
It’s the book with you in it.

687
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,480
You’re so frivolous.

688
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,080
I bought many food.

689
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,280
Who wants to party at my home?

690
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,880
I’m still in my hometown.
I haven’t come back yet.

691
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,080
I want to.

692
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,520
Me too.
But I have tutoring sessions tonight.

693
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,840
Then this is a date for Meng and me.

694
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,600
Such a God-given opportunity.

695
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,720
If you all can’t go

696
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,080
and I won’t go,

697
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,280
how sad will Meng be?

698
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,320
Chlorophyll, return the book for me.

699
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,420

Painkiller?

702

Have you arrived at the hospital now?

777
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,100
Aunt, don’t worry.

778
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,700
We have arrived.

779
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,700
What did the doctor say?

780
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,600
She just has a fever.

781
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,840
She’s now putting on a drip.

782
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,880
She’ll be fine soon.

783
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,160
Okay.

784
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,880
Thank you for doing this
in such a heavy rain.

785
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,920
Did you get wet?

786
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,220
I’m still home.

787
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,000
I wasn’t the one who sent her there.

788
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,400
Shi Che sent her to the hospital.

789
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,960
What are you looking at?

790
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,440
What’s up there?

791
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,560
Nothing.

792
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,840
Why are you here alone?

793
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,400
I’m practicing walking.

794
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,000
Somehow, I end up here.

795
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,800
Which ward are you in?

796
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,000
Let me walk you back.

797
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,800
No, I want to take some rest.

798
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,600
I hid this.

799
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,520
Let me share one with you.

800
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,240
Practice walking?

801
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,200
Is it hard?

802
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,400
I always fall down.

803
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,520
In the beginning, you’ll fall down.

804
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,000
But mom said that

805
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,600
if I keep working hard,

806
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,680
it will grow back again.

807
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,320
Your mom lied to you.

808
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,600
If you lose your leg,

809
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,800
it will never grow back again.

810
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,160
Why did you say this to a kid?

811
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,200
If you don’t tell him now,

812
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,600
he will be sadder in the future.

813
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,760
What’s your problem?

814
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,160
Forget it. Let’s go.

815
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,200
Are you all right?

816
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,160
I’m fine.

817
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,040
Isn’t that Jiang?

818
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,220
Didn’t he say that

819
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,840
he’s at home?

820
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,760
Let me go and take a look.

821
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,640
How about you?

822
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,480
Go and check on Miao first.

823
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,000
Be careful.

824
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,600
Okay.

825
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,920
Mom.

826
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,040
Mom, wait for me.

827
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,400
Mom, wait for me.

828
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,760
Mom, wait for me.

829
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,880
Kid.

830
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,360
Are you all right?

831
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,560
Kid.

832
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,320
Kid.

833
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,080
Kid, are you okay?

834
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,480
Why are you walking in the rain?

835
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:37,840
You’ll be drenched.

836
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,160
Ten years ago,

837
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,480
I seem to have heard the same words.

838
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,960
If you have something to say,

839
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,040
let’s go home first.

840
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,280
You’ll get ill in this rain.

841
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:58,920
I have nothing to say.

842
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,680
My leg has become

843
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,040
what it is now.

844
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,220
It’s all because of you.

845
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,440
I’m sorry.

846
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,360
For all these years,

847
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,560
I always want to make it up to you.

848
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,400
Make it up to me?

849
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,400
How can you?

850
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,640
Ten years ago,

851
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,440
my life completely changed overnight.

852
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,080
How can you make it up to me?

853
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,840
Do you have any idea

854
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,760
how I felt when the person

855
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,200
I want to protect passed out before me

856
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,720
and I couldn’t do anything?

857
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,080
How can you make it up to me?

858
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,640
You want to make up for my leg?

859
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,440
What you really want to make up for
is your guilt.

860
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,480
Hit him.

861
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,200
Don’t play with him.

862
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:20,680
Right.

863
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,480
Move.

864
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,560
If you dare to bully my brother again,

865
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,680
you’ll be dead.

866
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,000
You’ll be doomed.

867
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,480
Are you okay?

868
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,440
I’ll be fine even if you don’t come.

869
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,880
I protected you out of good intentions.

870
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,080
I don’t need your protection.

871
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,040
Then you thought

872
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,320
I stole your show.

873
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,520
Then why?

874
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,920
How can a younger sister
protect a bigger brother?

875
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,360
Although you’re the bigger brother,

876
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,760
I’m taller than you’re.

877
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,200
I should protect you.

878
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,040
I’ll be taller than you in the future.

879
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,880
Then I’ll protect you now.

880
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,040
And you’ll protect me
when we grow up, okay?

881
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,960
Okay. When I grow up, I’ll protect you.
