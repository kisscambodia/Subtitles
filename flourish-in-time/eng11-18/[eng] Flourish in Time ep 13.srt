<i>A Night at Old Schoolhouse</i>

31
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,960
I didn’t know that
you have such a hobby.

32
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,880
If you’re kidnapped,

33
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,280
just blink.

34
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,760
Actually,

35
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,000
this is quite fun.

36
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,760
It’s because there’s someone you like.

37
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,080
If you’re to gossip, then I’ll go now.

38
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,600
No. Let’s study.

39
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,160
Jiang Haoyue likes someone?

40
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,840
What should you do then?

41
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,440
I’ll of course take actions.

42
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,000
In the past, I thought
he isn’t interested in romance.

43
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,200
Now since someone has opened his heart,

44
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,600
I must grab this chance

45
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,680
and win him over.

46
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,520
Then what do you plan to do?

47
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,240
I’ll become his destiny.

48
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,040
Hello.

49
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,520
Today, Daifei and I will take you

50
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,400
to explore the widely spread

51
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,040
campus myths.

52
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,920
Daifei, take a look at the camera.

53
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,640
Hurry. It’s pretty late.

54
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,000
Come.

55
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,400
What’s going on?

56
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,280
Is Jiang Haoyue your destiny?

57
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,680
Isn’t that Jiang Haoyue?

58
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,800
When did he appear?

59
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,040
He was tutoring me at home that day.

60
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,080
It was impossible for him to show up
at the old schoolhouse.

61
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,440
So this is a ghost story?

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,240
Have you heard of Bai Lin’s Blessing?

63
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,680
It’s one of the seven myths
on our campus.

64
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,840
Story has it that
when the old schoolhouse was first built,

65
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,440
there was a blackout.

66
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,240
Someone played a prank

67
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,720
and locked a senior named Bai Lin

68
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,760
in a classroom.

69
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,600
She couldn’t speak.

70
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,880
To save herself,

71
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,320
she used a mirror to reflect moonlight,

72
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,960
hoping to attract others’ attention.

73
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,160
The moonlight reflected
by the mirror shone on

74
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,000
a boy’s face who was
chilling out in the playground.

75
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,280
That was how he rescued her.

76
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,320
Then their romance started.

77
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,960
How romantic!

78
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,480
But can mirrors reflect moonlight?

79
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,280
Those pranksters were so boring.

80
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,040
You really have your attention
on weird things.

81
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,640
Anyway, since then,

82
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,680
words spread on the campus,

83
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,440
saying,

84
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,000
when moonlight shines on

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,680
the old schoolhouse’s mirror,

86
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,960
and you come by,

87
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,520
the mirror will show

88
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,920
the person in your destiny.

89
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,400
Both of them will be blessed by Bai Lin.

90
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,400
And they’ll be together forever.

91
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,000
Su Daifei saw Jiang Haoyue
in the mirror.

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,960
They received the blessing.

93
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,160
Then they’ll be together forever?

94
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,040
No way.

95
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,080
I don’t believe it either.

96
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,760
This story only verifies

97
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,360
The Suspension Bridge Effect.

98
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,080
What is it?

99
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,640
When a person
crosses a suspension bridge,

100
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,120
his heart will
uncontrollably beat faster.

101
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,880
If at that time,
he happens to meet a person,

102
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,320
then he will mistake

103
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,360
this racing heartbeat
caused by the circumstance

104
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,440
for having a crush on the other person.

105
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,000
Actually, anyone

106
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,360
will have this illusion of romance

107
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,880
in a terrifying and intense environment.

108
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,820
But the real destined romance

109
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,640
needs to be verified
with solid statistics.

110
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,960
Whether we believe it or not,

111
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,080
people on the campus

112
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,360
are all saying that

113
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,040
they’re a match made in heaven.

114
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,440
A match made in heaven?

115
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,160
Su Daifei must be the one behind it.

116
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,920
I’ve made the decision.

117
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,520
I’ll talk to her face to face.

118
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,720
She is the childhood sweetheart

119
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,760
that Jiang Haoyue likes.

120
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,820
As expected, she’s a bad girl.

121
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,520
How many times have I said it?

122
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,880
I’m not a bad girl.

123
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,080
What’s going on with that video?

124
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,200
Don’t ask.

125
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,120
Daifei was so scared that day.

126
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,200
You were scared?

127
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,040
In the middle of the night,

128
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,320
a man suddenly appeared
out of nowhere in the mirror.

129
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,760
It’s pretty scary
even if that person is Jiang Haoyue.

130
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,520
You didn’t play any tricks?

131
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,960
You’re so mean.

132
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,400
Daifei is always
so scared of such things.

133
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,800
If there’s nothing more,

134
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,880
can we get through?

135
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,960
Have you heard of
our school’s campus myths?

136
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,960
You mean the story of destined romance?

137
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,040
No, not that one.

138
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,960
Legend has it that this corridor
is called the corridor of truth.

139
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,280
If those who pass through
this corridor tell lies,

140
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,260
they’ll be haunted by evil ghosts.

141
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,080
Why is Jiang Haoyue
having lunch with Lu Miao?

142
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,880
Isn’t Su Daifei his destined lover?

143
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,200
Well. If Lu Miao and Su Daifei

144
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,480
fall into water at the same time,

145
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,440
who will Jiang Haoyue save?

146
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,520
Lu Miao.

147
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:42,800
Sit down.

148
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,320
Why are there always
people talking about you?

149
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,680
Just don’t take

150
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,360
their words personally.

151
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,400
Don’t mind it.

152
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,960
But of course I’ll be angry

153
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,160
at what they say about you.

154
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,600
Have you watched the video

155
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,960
they’re talking about
on the campus forum?

156
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,720
No.

157
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,000
Confucius doesn’t talk about
ghosts and mythical spirits.

158
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,600
Confucius doesn’t talk about it.

159
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,920
But Lu Miao can.

160
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,920
Mr. Jiang,

161
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,600
do you believe in

162
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,080
the campus myths?

163
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,680
No, I don’t.

164
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,760
Myths are made up by people.

165
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,800
You’re already a high school student.

166
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,480
Do you still believe in stories
to trick kids?

167
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,240
Of course, I don’t.

168
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,040
69.

169
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,360
70.

170
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,160
This one is new.

171
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,080
Che, are you reading the comics or not?

172
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,640
Before I redeem myself,

173
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,280
I’ll never read comics again.

174
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,760
You get stronger with every setback.

175
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,040
You fail every time.

176
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,600
But your goals are higher and higher.

177
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,120
Cut out the nonsense.

178
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,640
I’ve already come up with a method.

179
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,880
Come.

180
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,560
Tomorrow, I’ll propose that
we go to the old schoolhouse

181
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,520
to find out the truth about the myth.

182
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,160
You’ll hide there in advance.

183
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,560
Pretend to be a ghost and scare Lu Miao.

184
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,200
When she panics,

185
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,040
I can grab her hands
and hold her in my arms.

186
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,960
By then,

187
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,160
I’ll become her hero

188
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,240
who rides on
the seven auspicious clouds.

189
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,280
I get it.

190
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,600
It’s like The Suspension Bridge Effect
Ziye talked about.

191
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,640
Are you sure that

192
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,120
a special girl like Miao

193
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,040
will be afraid of ghosts?

194
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,000
All girls will be afraid, right?

195
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,580
<i>One of the Seven Myths</i>

196
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,520
Are you really studying?

197
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,360
Of course.

198
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,920
Come. Drink milk and take some rest.

199
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,880
It’s still hot.

200
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,240
Mom, when you were in high school,

201
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,600
were there any strange myths
on the campus?

202
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,800
What?

203
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,440
No. Stop.

204
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,720
Mom. No.

205
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,120
There’s nothing.

206
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,400
Are you reading fiction?

207
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,160
Are you reading legends

208
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,360
or reading myths on your phone?

209
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,200
Nothing.

210
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,600
I’m writing homework.

211
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,880
Then why are you asking me
this question?

212
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,800
Are you distracted?

213
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,640
Listen. Don’t you laugh.

214
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,840
You thought I’m not in this room?

215
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,000
Actually, I have my eyes

216
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,160
fixed on you.

217
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,720
Stop listening to

218
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,240
such unimportant stories.

219
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,960
Listen, Lu Miao,

220
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,080
there are many things
that you shouldn’t believe in blindly.

221
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,240
If you listen to too many lies,
you’ll see them as truths.

222
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,200
Lies are lies.

223
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,080
How can they become truths?

224
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,600
Then you’ll lose your ability to
differentiate between right and wrong.

225
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,640
You read too many comics.

226
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,280
Your imagination is too wild.

227
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,360
Do you know?

228
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,080
Forget it. I’ll talk no more.

229
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,440
You’re just like that every day.

230
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,600
Milk?

231
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,400
I’ll get you another one.

232
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,640
Adults are so weird.

233
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,280
To break the rumors about campus myths.

234
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,120
To break free from
the chains of superstition.

235
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,960
To protect the light
of truth and science.

236
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,280
A brave and great mission.

237
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,120
Shatter superstition.

238
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,120
Explore science.

239
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,160
The innocence of Jiang Haoyue

240
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,600
will be protected by me.

241
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,760
Protect Jiang Haoyue’s innocence?

242
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,560
Anyway, go for it.

243
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,760
You’re not coming?

244
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,960
I’m occupied that day.

245
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,960
I can’t go.

246
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,640
Guoguo, are you scared?

247
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,440
You’re not afraid?

248
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,040
Of course not.

249
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,720
I’ve done nothing wrong.

250
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,440
Look how scared he is.

251
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,600
Your fearlessness scares me though.

252
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,840
Guoguo has weak nerves.

253
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,720
Then he won’t go.

254
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,240
Let’s meet tomorrow at 10:00 PM.

255
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,660
See you there.

256
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,080
Daifei, the teacher wants to see you.

257
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,800
Okay.

258
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,040
Let’s go.

259
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,080
Qu Wei, I’ll go now.

260
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,640
Okay, see you tomorrow.

261
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,760
See you tomorrow.

262
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,320
What are you doing?

263
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,440
I plan on going to the old schoolhouse

264
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,440
to capture the mythical energy.

265
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,640
You’re interested in this?

266
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,520
As a scholar,

267
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,120
I need to be curious about everything.

268
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,360
This is the night vision device.

269
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,040
It allows me to

270
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,280
observe every detail clearly
in the darkness.

271
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,800
I plan to explore tonight.
Will you come with me?

272
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,760
I’m not interested.

273
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,480
I’ll go now.

274
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,240
Bye-bye.

275
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,080
Che.

276
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,400
Will I get beaten by Miao later?

277
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,360
No. Just show yourself in the distance.

278
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,440
Make some noise.

279
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,200
Pat her shoulder at most.

280
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,480
Fine. Hurry up.

281
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,880
I’m still logged in on the video game.

282
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,800
Don’t worry.

283
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,280
Follow my command later.

284
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,360
There they are.

285
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,920
I’ll hide now.

286
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,680
Okay. Hurry.

287
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,520
Faster.

288
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,240
Okay.

289
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,480
Che.

290
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,800
You’re pretty early today.

291
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,720
I’m waiting for you.

292
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,760
Who were you talking to?

293
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,920
No, I was alone.

294
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,120
I just...

295
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,720
Both of you!

296
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,540
Don’t create a horrifying atmosphere
in advance.

297
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,200
Open it. Hurry.

298
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,280
Wait. Why is the door locked?

299
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,320
The guide didn’t say
it would be locked.

300
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,280
What should we do now?

301
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,800
The plan can’t keep up
with the changes.

302
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,640
You need to depend on me
at crucial moments.

303
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,920
Chlorophyll, borrow me your hair pin.

304
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,200
Can you do it or not?

305
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,540
Let’s take a rain check if you can’t.

306
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,840
Who said I can’t?

307
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,120
You have to call me Dad.

308
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,680
You wish.

309
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,540
Thank you, lock picking expert.

310
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,160
Hurry. Why are you posing there?

311
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,200
Okay.

312
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,200
Science.

313
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,040
Reason.

314
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,240
It’s fine, Ziye.

315
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,960
There must be someone
who’s playing a prank.

316
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,240
The noise seems to
come from the second floor.

317
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,800
Let’s go upstairs now.

318
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,840
Go.

319
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,120
We’re heading to the second floor. Hide!

320
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,760
Okay. I’ll be there soon.
Buy me some time.

321
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,000
Wait for me.

322
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,240
Che, don’t make strange noises.

323
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,320
What are you doing?

324
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,280
Are we going back?

325
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,520
How about

326
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,360
picking it up when we come back?

327
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,200
This...

328
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,280
Shi Che, after you.

329
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,440
Ladies first. After you.

330
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,000
If you’re both scared,

331
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,400
let me go in first.

332
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,200
- I’m not scared.
- I’m not scared.

333
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,240
I’ll go first.

334
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,240
How about this?

335
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:04,920
I’ll say one, two, three.

336
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,520
Let’s go inside together.

337
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,120
One. Two. Three.

338
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,160
Who is it?

339
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,720
Your performance is so amazing.

340
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,480
Qu Wei, why are you here?

341
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,960
I’m on an adventure.

342
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,720
How about you?

343
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,960
We’re here to explore science

344
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,960
and get rid of superstition.

345
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,000
When did you come here?

346
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,280
Half an hour ago.

347
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,480
Half an hour?

348
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,720
Then I came here
ten minutes earlier than you did.

349
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,120
You came here earlier?

350
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,960
How did you get in
when the door was locked?

351
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,880
From the backdoor.

352
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,000
The backdoor wasn’t locked.

353
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,160
You didn’t know?

354
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,320
Was the noise made by you?

355
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,520
How’s that possible?

356
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,680
It was from this.

357
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,200
It was made by this radio.

358
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,320
I turned it off when I came in.

359
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,000
Seems that there’s another person here.

360
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,480
Coming.

361
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,920
- Mr. Lu.
- Haoyue.

362
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,560
Miao is still studying?

363
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,600
Yes.

364
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,000
I heard from the weather broadcast that

365
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,280
it will rain heavily tonight.

366
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,640
I need to pick up Aunt Fang.

367
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,160
Listen.

368
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,240
Take the keys.

369
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,160
When Miao is done with studying,

370
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,600
let her go home on her own.

371
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,440
I see.

372
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,480
Close the door.

373
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,600
Where can she be
in the middle of the night?

374
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,480
Look.

375
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,280
Here’s a pair of embroidered shoes.

376
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,100
Look.

377
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,200
<i>Made in Putian</i>

378
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,640
These shoes are bought recently.

379
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,960
Seems that someone placed them here
purposefully to scare people.

380
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,200
There must be more.

381
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,880
Let’s search.

382
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,400
Okay.

383
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,560
What?

384
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,760
Do you have tissue?

385
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,880
Yes.

386
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,920
Wait a minute.

387
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,840
Hurry. Clean it.

388
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,760
Guoguo, if you don’t show up soon,

389
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,120
they’ll get used to
the horror atmosphere.

390
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,040
I’m ready.

391
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,080
Guide them to the lecture room.

392
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,100
This is paint.

393
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,100
It’s also new.

394
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,340
It hasn’t even dried yet.

395
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,720
Where’s the mirror in the myth?

396
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,280
We haven’t been to the lecture room yet.

397
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,560
Is it in the lecture room?

398
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,240
Why not take a look?

399
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,800
Let’s take a look. Come.

400
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,560
Come on.

401
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,000
Someone is playing a prank.

402
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,040
I’ll definitely find you.

403
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,240
Don’t touch me. It tickles.

404
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,760
I didn’t touch you.

405
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,600
I’ve been looking for you all night.
You finally showed up.

406
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,840
Freeze.

407
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:05,880
Don’t run.

408
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,560
Move.

409
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,400
Freeze.

410
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,600
Let’s go.

411
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,760
Where is everyone?

412
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,280
Why have they all disappeared?

413
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,360
Don’t be afraid. I’ll protect you.

414
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,960
You’re so touched
that you can’t even speak?

415
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,760
Actually, Meng,

416
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,200
I think you and I are like

417
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,000
Hanamichi Sakuragi and
Haruko Akagi,

418
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,920
Naruto and Sasuke,

419
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,440
Inuyasha and Kagome,

420
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,340
Yang Guo and his condor.

421
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,200
Anyway, I think we’re a perfect match.

422
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,200
I think we can
take our friendship to the next level.

423
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,800
I know.

424
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,560
You don’t have to answer me in a hurry.

425
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,600
I...

426
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,560
I can...

427
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,960
You got the wrong person.

428
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,720
Chlorophyll.

429
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,100
The first half is fine.

430
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,200
But why Yang Guo and his condor?

431
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,160
I’m totally defeated by you.

432
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,840
You didn’t forget about love confession
when fleeing for your life.

433
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,160
No wonder

434
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,200
you’re an active user of
the forum’s romance section.

435
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,480
How do you know?

436
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,340
You’re Unswayed by Spring Breeze?

437
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,880
Nice to meet you.

438
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,480
So you’re the one
who came up with those bad ideas?

439
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,920
Those ideas are good.

440
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,280
But you’re not the right person.
What else can I do?

441
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,440
I don’t believe you.

442
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,920
Smart kids are so cunning.

443
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,520
I’ll let the whole school know that

444
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,600
the Study Representative likes to
read romance novels.

445
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,520
Then tomorrow everyone will know that

446
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,920
the principal’s son is in love.

447
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,920
And his affection is unreciprocated.

448
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,480
Let’s find out
who’ll be more embarrassed.

449
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,720
Who is it?

450
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,920
Guoguo?

451
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,560
Is that you?

452
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,400
Guoguo?

453
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,240
Why is Qu Wei always following me?

454
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,760
It’s so hard to get rid of him.

455
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,480
Su Daifei?

456
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,680
Why is she here?

457
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,440
Fine.

458
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,880
Why are you here?

459
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,320
Ghost!

460
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,680
It’s me.

461
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,000
Freeze.

462
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,320
Don’t get away.

463
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,280
- No way. It’s him again?
- Freeze.

464
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,080
He didn’t catch up, right?

465
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,560
Help.

466
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,920
Don’t run.

467
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,200
Hello.

468
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:39,840
Hello.

469
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,220
You’re at the old schoolhouse?

470
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,640
Yes.

471
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,400
Did you see Lu Miao?

472
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,200
She was...

473
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,040
She was right behind me just now.

474
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,000
I don’t know where she went.

475
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,640
Find her for me.

476
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,720
Fine. I’ll go now.

477
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,920
Stop.

478
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,840
Su Daifei.

479
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,240
I knew it was you.

480
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,720
Where did you hide the mirror?

481
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,240
I should have picked up
my phone earlier.

482
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,080
Jiang Haoyue.

483
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,760
Why are you here?

484
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,040
I know this event isn’t so simple.

485
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,200
Where are you going?

486
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,400
In the video,

487
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,640
the light in the mirror is odd.

488
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,560
Did you use mirroring

489
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,600
to process my photo?

490
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,960
You knew I lied
but you didn’t expose me.

491
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,720
Do you...

492
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,160
like me a little bit?

493
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,680
You thought too much.

494
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,000
I just don’t think it’s necessary
to care for the rumors.

495
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,280
Actually, I regret it a lot.

496
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,500
I shouldn’t have lied.

497
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,600
The campus myths are real.

498
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,960
I’m haunted by evil ghosts recently.

499
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,720
Jiang Haoyue.

500
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,680
I’m so scared.

501
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,000
Can you walk me out, please?

502
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,200
Sorry.

503
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,020
I’m here to pick up Lu Miao.

504
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,720
Do me a favor.

505
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,960
I’m on the first floor.

506
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,760
Come here.

507
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,840
Qu Wei will come to pick you up later.

508
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,400
Don’t do such

509
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,560
boring things again.

510
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,240
Jiang Haoyue.

511
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,600
My battery is dead.

512
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,360
Mine too.

513
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,480
Are you still scared?

514
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:55,640
How about you?

515
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,000
I’m a bit scared, too.

516
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,680
I dare not to make a move.

517
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,960
We can’t just stay here all night.

518
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,840
Let’s be courageous and run out.

519
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,240
I don’t want to see weird things.

520
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,480
Then cover your eyes.

521
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,760
How am I supposed to walk
with my eyes covered?

522
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,800
I can hold your hands.

523
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,560
I don’t want to hear weird noises.

524
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,100
Then cover your ears as well.

525
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,200
Come. I’ll go with you.

526
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,720
Come on.

527
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,920
Can you hear what I’m saying?

528
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,720
What?

529
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,080
I’m saying that

530
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,540
you should say something, too.

531
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,100
I’m scared as well.

532
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,020
What should I say?

533
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,800
Say something to ward off evil spirits.

534
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,520
3.1415926.

535
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,600
It’s a wood stick.

536
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,040
It’s fine. Let’s go.

537
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,640
So weird. Where’s everyone?

538
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,840
Calm down.

539
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:19,920
Science.

540
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,880
It’s just an average mirror.

541
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,920
How can it tell my destiny?

542
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,840
Jiang Haoyue.

543
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,640
Watch out.

544
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,240
Are you all right?

545
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,040
Jiang Haoyue, are you okay?

546
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,240
I’m fine.

547
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,200
You scared me to death.

548
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:43,800
I...

549
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,520
You’re scared?

550
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,440
If anything happens to you,

551
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,240
do you have any idea
how worried your parents will be?

552
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,640
Don’t sneak out alone at night again.

553
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,240
Do you hear me?

554
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,680
I get it.

555
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,760
My dad sent you to look for me?

556
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,400
Can you not

557
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,200
tell him that I came here?

558
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,520
No.

559
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,400
They didn’t know.

560
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,240
Hurry and leave.

561
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,720
Okay.

562
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,000
It’s a shame that
Qu Wei doesn’t play basketball.

563
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,560
His stamina is incredible.

564
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,340
Stop.

565
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,240
I’ll definitely catch you today.

566
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,080
Aren’t you escorting me out?

567
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,400
Yes.

568
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,400
On the way out,
we can find out the truth.

569
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:42,960
Don’t you want to know

570
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,240
the look of the creature
that scared you?

571
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,000
I don’t.

572
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,200
64462 29489.

573
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,760
5493.

574
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,640
How did you memorize
such boring figures?

575
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,760
This is not boring.

576
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,440
Pi is very significant in mathematics.

577
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,040
You can hear me?

578
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,840
Here are the staircases.

579
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,600
Beware of the staircases.

580
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,120
There are two more.

581
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,840
It’s all right. We’re out.

582
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,560
Thank you.

583
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,920
You’re welcome.

584
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,920
Without your boring Pi,
I wouldn’t dare to come out.

585
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,600
Look behind you!

586
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,080
Let go of me, Che.

587
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,080
Let go of me.

588
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,320
Fortunately, you went home in time.

589
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,120
It rained so suddenly.

590
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,440
Right.

591
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,520
I experienced too much horror tonight.

592
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,960
I’ll go to bed now, bye.

593
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,520
Okay. See you tomorrow at school.

594
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,720
When your dad and mom ask you later,

595
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,520
don’t accidentally spill the secret.

596
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,680
In case they get worried.

597
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,560
Rest assured.

598
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,640
I’ll do as you told me to.

599
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,680
Listen.

600
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,680
Don’t believe in such rumors
from now on.

601
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,360
Do you hear me?

602
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
But I indeed heard weird noises

603
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,480
in the old schoolhouse.

604
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,720
Su Daifei made those noises
on purpose.

605
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,840
That’s the truth?

606
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,520
But Su Daifei’s video...

607
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,480
That video was edited.

608
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,840
How can there be a destined lover?

609
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,360
Even if the video is fake,

610
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,360
I still believe in

611
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,920
the myth of destined lovers.

612
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,360
Why?

613
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,720
Because I’ve met mine.

614
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,720
Let me blow-dry your hair.

615

You’ll just give up on Jiang Haoyue?

617
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,200
There’s nothing else I can do.

618
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,920
I was wrong the whole time.

619
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,720
Jiang Haoyue has indeed
opened his heart,

620
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,600
but only to Lu Miao.

621
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,560
Recording of the ghost event
at No. 1 High School.

622
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,400
This is my ring tone.

623
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,400
I placed the embroidered shoes
near the window.

624
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,320
The red hand prints were left by me
when I was wiping my hands.

625
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,520
I left the skeleton lying on the floor.

626
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,840
This was Su Daifei’s crying sound.

627
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,760
That figure with long hair was Guoguo.

628
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,360
It’s me.

629
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,960
You even recorded all of this?

630
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,200
No, I didn’t.

631
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,600
There was someone besides us that day?

632
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,280
That’s impossible.

633
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,320
I searched the whole building
before I left.

634
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,200
There was no one else.

635
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,680
When we left,

636
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,720
we locked the front gate again.

637
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,560
Who recorded this?

638
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,600
Dad, how does this work?

639
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,720
When will it be ready?
I wanna take photos.

640
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,840
Soon.

641
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,760
Let me take a look.

642
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,000
Haoyue, move a bit.

643
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,480
Okay. Go.

644
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,280
Go.

645
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,520
Slow down. Haoyue. Come.

646
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,320
Let me lift you up.

647
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,160
Sit tight.

648
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:03,880
Okay.

649
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,200
Come.

650
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,120
Don’t be scared. Relax.

651
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,800
Look. Like me.

652
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,280
Haoyue.

653
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,400
Relax. It’s fine.

654
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,560
Come.

655
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,840
Great.

656
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:29,560
When I was young,
I mistook moon for white plate.

657
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,480
You’re wrong.
It’s white jade plate.

658
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,560
You’re not the only one
who knows a lot.

659
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,440
Let me ask you.

660
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,840
What’s on the moon?

661
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:41,880
Lunar craters. Argon, Helium,
Natrium, Kalium, and Hydrogen.

662
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,720
You’re wrong.

663
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,000
Then tell me what’s on the moon.

664
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,520
Of course, there’re Chang’e,

665
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,520
Jade Rabbit and Sailor Moon.

666
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:49,840
Sailor what?

667
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,480
Smile.
