<i>Class 10, Grade 1</i>

34

It’s the last five minutes

35
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,880
for our class.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,080
Next semester,

37
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,520
you’ll go to different classes.

38
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,640
Some will be in the same class,

39
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,840
while others

40
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,640
will go to new classes.

41
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,600
I’ll remember every one of you,

42
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,480
for you’re the first students of mine.

43
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,560
I hope you can remember

44
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,440
the classmates around you.

45
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,600
Remember Class 10, Grade 1.

46
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,560
Because we used to be together.

47
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,680
Yes!

48
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,320
Okay.

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,920
Dismiss.

50
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,440
I don’t want to leave you.

51
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,620
I don’t want to leave you, either.

52
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,580
Stop.

53
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,040
Don’t be sentimental.

54
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,240
It’s fine.

55
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,760
We can still meet. Right?

56
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,840
Ziye.

57
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,560
You are my best friend.

58
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,320
I know.

59
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,400
In the vacation, let’s hold

60
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,440
a farewell ceremony for Ziye.

61
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,960
No. Don’t.

62
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,000
I told you. Don’t make it sentimental.

63
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,360
You don’t know.

64
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,880
It’s great for me

65
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,160
to get away from you.

66
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,960
I can finally take a breath.

67
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,360
No need to explain your questions.

68
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,720
No annoying clubs.

69
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,480
No need to play basketball with you.

70
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,880
No need to listen
to your childish ideas.

71
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,200
No need to think of bad ideas
in the stadium.

72
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,240
I’m a quasi-genius, alright?

73
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,800
How could I fool around with you guys

74
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,040
this year?

75
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,480
What do you mean by fooling around?

76
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,800
The senior excluded.

77
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,720
It’s my honor

78
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,480
to know you.

79
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,360
In my first year, I really had

80
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,200
a great time.

81
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,680
We’ll be friends of a lifetime.

82
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,400
Don’t ignore me

83
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,240
for I study science.

84
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,280
We won’t.

85
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,200
I’ll still chat with you about gossips.

86
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,760
Stupid.

87
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,080
Have we arrived?

88
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,160
Yes.

89
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,200
Have a look for me.

90
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,280
How many subjects did I fail?

91
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,320
Two.

92
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,120
Where?

93
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,400
Here.

94
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,600
I’m doomed.

95
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,720
Half as many students
chose liberal arts as before,

96
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,600
but my place is even lower than before.

97
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,320
If my mom knows this...

98
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,640
How many subjects did you fail?

99
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,000
My name isn’t on it.

100
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,440
I can’t

101
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,640
let my dad know about this.

102
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,240
Shi Che.

103
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,640
Your dad called you to his office.

104
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,260
“Wind blows above the cold Yishui Water.

105
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,480
Hero...”

106
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,040
Good luck.

107
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,640
Son.

108
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,480
In the high school, I can obviously feel

109
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,120
that you’ve made great progress.

110
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,640
Feelings may not be true.

111
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,080
In junior high school, you said

112
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,040
you wanted to be an athlete.

113
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,560
I said it even in primary school.

114
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,440
Yeah.

115
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,600
You said it in primary school.

116
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,880
But you know,

117
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,680
in our country,

118
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,760
the growth of athletes are different

119
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,840
from ordinary people.

120
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,480
You’re already a sophomore.

121
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,400
You’ll soon prepare for gaokao.

122
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,520
You should have a goal in mind.

123
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,320
Your mom and I prepared you these files

124
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,920
about medicine,

125
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,960
politics and laws.

126
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,800
I have a goal.

127
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,960
I’ll go to a sports university.

128
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,560
My dream is basketball.

129
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,840
Even if I can’t be a player,

130
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,440
I’ll do a relevant job.

131
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,200
Son.

132
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,400
Your hobby

133
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,120
isn’t necessarily to be your job.

134
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,320
A hobby

135
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,440
will change.

136
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,240
Yes,

137
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,760
sometimes, adolescents are stubborn.

138
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,880
What’s your dream when you were little?

139
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,520
I grew up

140
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,200
in the countryside.

141
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,040
I knew little about the outside world.

142
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,840
I admired my teacher the most.

143
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,240
So I dreamed to be a teacher.

144
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,880
Mom has told me your stories.

145
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,440
I know you can understand me.

146
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,240
Son.

147
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,600
I know you all the time.

148
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,760
But this test...

149
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,000
The test is no big deal.

150
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,520
I just need to be top 500 in the grade.

151
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,360
Top 500?

152
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,000
That’s not even enough
for a sports university.

153
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,880
This is a top university.

154
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,000
Which place should I be?

155
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,160
Liberal arts.

156
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,720
Top 200.

157
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,000
Then I’ll get into

158
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,840
the top 200 in liberal arts.

159
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,200
Okay.

160
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,760
If you fail,

161
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,600
listen to your mom

162
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,320
and study these files.

163
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,320
Okay. What if I succeed?

164
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,920
Then I’ll

165
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,720
write my name “Shi” reversely.

166
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,040
Okay. Deal.

167
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,320
Don’t go back on your word.

168
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,480
Deal.

169
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,040
No change.

170
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,880
A big bundle was 2 yuan.

171
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,600
Now a small bundle is 2.2 yuan.

172
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,360
We can buy other vegetables.

173
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,280
Other vegetables are expensive, too.

174
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,560
And even more expensive.

175
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,200
All vegetables are expensive.

176
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,240
We also have to support that Jiang Yi.

177
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,640
Alright.

178
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,480
I know you work hard every day.

179
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,880
I’ll cook dinner

180
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,040
tonight.

181
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,960
I’ll take a business call.

182
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,760
Sister.

183
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,040
Lin.

184
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,760
How is it?

185
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,800
You asked me to find you a job.

186
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,080
The employer replied.

187
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,960
He’s very satisfied with you.

188
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,760
Really?

189
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,120
He’d like to meet you.

190
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,600
That’s great.

191
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,480
Great.

192
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,160
He’d like to know

193
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,360
if you are good at WeChat business

194
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,040
and new media.

195
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,360
It’s all about online work,

196
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,440
e-commerce, official account business.

197
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,960
Those are very popular.

198
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,760
So, he wants someone
who knows traditional marketing

199
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,520
and also new media technology.

200
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,200
Can you do it?

201
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,640
I...

202
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,600
I’ll learn about it.

203
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,640
Okay. Thanks.

204
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,480
Yes.

205
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,480
Mr. Wen.

206
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,680
Please go ahead.

207
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,760
Okay.

208
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,680
Work is the most important.

209
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,080
I’ll go however busy I am.

210
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,000
Okay.

211
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,200
Okay. Mr. Wen.

212
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,440
Goodbye.

213
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,880
Okay. See you tomorrow.

214
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,640
Goodbye.

215
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,520
What’s it?

216
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,880
A parents’ meeting tomorrow?

217
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,960
No.

218
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,720
He wants to talk with us

219
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,680
about Miao’s major option.

220
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,280
I need to go to school tomorrow.

221
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,120
Major option?

222
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,880
I’ll go for this.

223
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,480
Someone wise should go.

224
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,960
Won’t you work tomorrow?

225
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,000
Children’s future is the top priority.

226
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,840
You are good.

227
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,800
I’ll explain it to my client.

228
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,320
See the teacher tomorrow...

229
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,960
Have some tea.

230
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,640
Thanks.

231
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,520
Sit.

232
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,360
Thanks for taking care of Lu Miao.

233
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,920
You’re welcome. My job.

234
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,600
I suppose you know her result

235
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,200
in this test.

236
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,280
What test?

237
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,080
Assessment test.

238
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,440
Haven’t you signed on it?

239
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,160
Those things happen again.

240
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,200
Sorry.

241
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,600
Please wait for a moment. Alright?

242
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,400
Sure.

243
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,560
No.

244
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,480
Mrs. Lu. Hold on.

245
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,200
How to solve this question?

246
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,080
Are you studying for TOEFL?

247
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,400
It won’t be in the recommendation.

248
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,400
Help me with this question.

249
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,840
It’s the senior year.

250
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,000
How can you be so idle?

251
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,920
So can you.

252
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,120
I can’t.

253
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,160
The National Chemistry Olympiad
is coming.

254
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,880
I didn’t make it to the final last year,

255
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,880
thanks to you.

256
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,720
Don’t worry.

257
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,920
I choose physics this year.

258
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,240
That won’t make any difference.

259
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,880
I must at least get into final.

260
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,800
Only the top 20 of Gold Prize
can be nominated.

261
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,560
Why do you want to be nominated?

262
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,120
My family are all first places
in competitions

263
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,520
and nominated into college.

264
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,040
I got the second place.

265
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,000
I’ve broken one family tradition.

266
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,320
I can’t break another, can I?

267
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,640
Here.

268
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,600
“2” is missing.

269
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,600
Aunt Fang.

270
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,800
NBA season is about to begin.

271
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,640
My battle report

272
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,920
records the birth of kings.

273
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,800
I know.

274
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,000
This is the same as

275
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,720
Ziye’s analysis book.

276
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,560
Yes.

277
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,960
What is it to do with her?

278
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,260
They even speak

279
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,060
in the same way.

280
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,440
“What is it to do with her?”

281
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,640
Well.

282
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,000
I’m gonna buy snacks. What do you want?

283
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,640
Chocolate.

284
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,280
Chocolate?

285
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,520
You don’t eat.

286
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,160
I want the big ones.

287
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:51,960
- Big ones?
- Hazelnut flavor.

288
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,400
Lu Miao!

289
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,880
Come here!

290
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,360
Mom…

291
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,920
What brings you here?

292
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,920
Come here!

293
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,560
Mrs. Lu.

294
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,160
Wait here!

295
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,280
No wonder Lu Miao is good at sports.

296
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,520
She runs every day.

297
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,360
Stop looking. Go to study.

298
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,040
Lu Miao always surprises me.

299
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,320
We all have tough parents.

300
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,920
Mom. Stop chasing me!

301
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,600
Stop there!

302
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,640
I can’t.

303
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,520
Next time...!

304
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,160
My shoes!

305
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,480
You!

306
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,800
Stop there!

307
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,440
Mom, stop chasing!

308
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,200
Can’t I catch up with you?

309
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,880
Can’t I catch up with you?

310
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,480
Help!

311
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,600
You!

312
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,680
Look at you!

313
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,240
Are you even so bad

314
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,840
at imitating my signature?

315
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,560
That’s the best I can do!

316
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,320
How dare you...?

317
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,680
Auntie. So many people here.

318
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,280
It’s not appropriate, is it?

319
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,080
Go home after school.

320
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,480
I’ll cook roasted pork
with bamboo shoots for you.

321
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,400
Be sure to take her home.

322
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,760
I finally got away with it.

323
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,960
Got away with it?

324
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,000
I doubt it.

325
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,200
Just a summer vacation.

326
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,120
Did you forget so quickly?

327
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,880
I didn’t have time to review

328
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,000
for the sudden test.

329
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,080
That’s just a test.

330
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,400
Why are you so serious?

331
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,920
Grade 2 is very important.

332
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,680
Teachers will speak fast

333
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,960
and won’t repeat.

334
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,440
Take it to heart.

335
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,960
I swear

336
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,440
I’ll work hard.

337
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,200
How?

338
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,280
Do more exercises.

339
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,000
You need to learn tactics.

340
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,800
Let me ask you.

341
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,320
What’s the universal formula
of dislocation subtraction?

342
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,080
Sn plus a...

343
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,400
Wait for me after school.

344
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,400
I’ll teach you again.

345
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,360
No need.

346
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,000
You can teach me
before the monthly exam.

347
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,040
My priority now

348
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,280

When you get home,

351
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,320
you must say something good

352
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,040
to my mom.

353
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,280
I know.

354
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,640
What would you like for dinner?

355
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,240
My treat.

356
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,920
Before your mom left,

357
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,320
she said she’d cook pork for you.

358
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,480
Don’t forget that.

Yes.

I spent it.

386
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,680
Spent on what?

387
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,680
What did you buy?

388
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,760

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,880
Is this newly bought?

392
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,920
Well, the rent.

393
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,240
The water and electricity bills
this month.

394
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,080
These were all paid by me.

Well.

399
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,200
I didn’t lie.

Aren’t you anxious?

408
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,400
I went to school today.

409
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,280
The teacher suggested her
to have cram classes.

410
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,200
Yes. Cram classes are costly,

411
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,760
but we must spend money on them.

412
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,520
It concerns her future.

413
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,480
I didn’t know it until I went to pay.

414
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,280
Where is the money?

415
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,600
She’s just a sophomore.

416
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,280
Why bother to have cram classes?

417
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,800
She’s already pressured.

418
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,320
That won’t help.

419
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,560
Don’t make a fuss.

420
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,440
You always follow suit.

421
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,680
Jiang is already a senior.

422
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,320
Has he ever had cram classes?

423
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,680
If she was half as good as him,

424
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,720
I wouldn’t be so worried!

425
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,080
Don’t say these useless things.

426
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:21,800
Where is the money?

427
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,600
You won.

428
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,520
I won’t talk.

429
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,680
You keep silent again.

430
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,320
Why are you silent?

431
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,720
Tell me.

432
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,920
If I talk,

433
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,200
you’ll argue with me.

434
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,960
How can I talk?

435
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,800
Fine. I’ll stop.

436
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,720
Go ahead.

437
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,760
Tell me. Where is the money?

438
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,280
How come you’ve changed like this?

439
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,240
You must have menopause in advance.

440
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,880
Have I changed?

441
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,440
How have I changed?

442
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,800
Are you loathing me?

443
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,240
Because I’m worried about her study!

444
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,100
Dad.

445
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,960
How could you say that?

446
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,040
You’re gonna make mom cry.

447
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,880
I don’t do well at study.

448
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,520
You shouldn’t waste money

449
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,280
on cram classes.

450
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,280
Please stop arguing.

451
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,320
I don’t need that.

452
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,160
No. You are a sophomore now.

453
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,560
What to do

454
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,520
if you fail in gaokao?

455
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,640
You must have cram classes.

456
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,640
Listen, Lu Yongfei.

457
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,600
She must have the classes!

458
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,280
It’s not about you.

459
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,280
Go to do your homework.

460
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,800
Go ahead.

461
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,200
Leave us alone.

462
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,460
Lu Yongfei.

463
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,640
Explain it.

464
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,480
How did you spend her tuition?

465
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,280
She doesn’t need cram classes now.

466
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,080
Why?

467
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,560
That’s useless.

468
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,680
Is it useless

469
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,440
or you can’t afford the tuition?

470
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,660
Money again.

471
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,340
I’ll get the money. Okay?

472
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,400
Is it helpful for her study?

473
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,400
Is she happy?

474
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,560
Fine. You’ll get the money.

475
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,080
Jiang.

476
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,400
You left something here.

477
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,880
I’m gonna bring it to you.

478
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,160
Should I put in a good word for you?

479
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,560
Don’t.

480
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,720
No need.

481
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:57,960
What’s going on?

482
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,080
Did your mom scold you?

483
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,720
Did I push you? How did I push you?

484
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,480
No.

485
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,680
Tell me! Did I push you?

486
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,680
Let’s talk in school tomorrow.

487
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,600
Good night.

488
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,360
Miao. Would you go
for the basketball game?

489
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,520
No.

490
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,640
I’m going to the reading room.

491
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,000
Why are you going there?

492
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,280
To study with Jiang Haoyue.

493
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:42,940
Hey.

494
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,580
Where are you going?

495
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,660
I’m going to study.

496
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,340
Go to practice alone.

497
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,740
Hey, are you going to study?

498
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,840
Are you mad?

499
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,500
Are you ditching me for a girl?

500
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,800
Am I?

501
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,200
Yes, you are.

502
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,160
I promised my dad

503
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,280
to get in top 200 in this monthly exam.

504
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,520
What?

505
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,960
Top 200?

506
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,800
Do you know your place

507
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,000
in the last exam?

508
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,840
What is it?

509
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,200
567th place.

510
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,600
You should pray

511
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,400
for getting into top 500.

512
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,480
Do you want to get in top 200?

513
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,880
Am I that bad?

514
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,560
You’ve always been that bad.

515
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,520
At a glance of your ranking,

516
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,840
I’ll know how many students
there are in the grade.

517
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,840
One more reason to study.

518
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,480
Sit.

519
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,440
Your goal is way too high.

520
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,880
Moreover,

521
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,440
will Jiang Haoyue help you?

522
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,320
In quantum mechanics,
the particles that make up matter

523
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,440
are the wave function.

524
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,960
Wave function is negative.

525
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,960
What brings you here?

526
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,680
Study.

527
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,000
There are many empty seats.

528
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,120
Yes, there are many.

529
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,840
I mean you can take another seat.

530
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,440
What on earth are you doing here?

531
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,800
I really come to study.

532
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,000
The modulus of a complex number
may not be a positive real number.

533
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,800
Why?

534
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,040
Aren’t they all positive real numbers?

535
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,680
Do you want me to help you?

536
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,200
Do you want to study as well?

537
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,880
Yes, this monthly exam
is very important to me.

538
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,720
I made a deal with my dad.

539
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,100
If I get into top 200 in liberal arts,

540
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,480
he’ll no longer stop me
from learning sports.

541
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,400
I can help you.

542
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,920
But finish these papers of six subjects.

543
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,720
Give them to me tomorrow.

544
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,880
Six subjects one night?

545
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
Are you kidding me?

546
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,000
Even an exam takes two days.

547
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,440
One night?

548
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,400
Impossible.

549
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,080
Don’t come to me until you finish.

550
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,120
Wait and see.

551
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,840
These are my papers!

552
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,720
I had time today

553
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,960
and checked the banking transfers.

554
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,440
In last April,

555
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,400
there was an expense of 30,000.

556
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,560
If I remember correctly,

557
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,000
Jiang Haoyue’s artificial leg

558
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,760
was replaced in last April. Right?

559
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,720
You checked my banking transfers.

560
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,040
Will you check my phone records later?

561
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,960
It depends on how many secrets you have.

562
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,280
Lu Yongfei, since I married you,

563
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,200
we’ve been living a peaceful life.

564
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,520
Since we had Miao,

565
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,440
I’ve been frugal,

566
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,800
giving all the best things

567
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,320
to you two.

568
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,720
For so many years,

569
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,680
I seldom buy new clothes.

570
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,160
Have you noticed it?

571
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,240
I shared the burden with you,

572
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,040
didn’t I?

573
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,960
Okay.

574
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,720
Since Jiang Haoyue’s incident,

575
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,340
I’ve never complained.

576
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,320
We’ve been

577
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,320
facing everything together,

578
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,080
haven’t we?

579
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,760
Am I selfish?

580
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,440
Okay. From now on,

581
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,560
I’ll be a selfish person.

582
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,200
Let me ask you, Lu Yongfei.

583
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,120
Had it not been
for Jiang Haoyue’s incident,

584
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,280
Miao

585
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,480
would have had more care from us

586
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,520
and our life would’ve been better.

587
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,480
Had it not been
for Jiang Haoyue’s incident,

588
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,440
I wouldn’t have had to work so hard

589
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,840
and bear

590
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,920
so much pressure

591
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,160
and Miao could

592
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,160
have had better cram classes!

593
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,200
Her study wouldn’t have been so poor!

594
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,680
I’m wondering,

595
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,200
you spent all the money

596
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,320
on others’ child.

597
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,840
Isn’t Miao your daughter?

598
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,680
Money!

599
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,280
Money again!

600
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,440
We can make money!

601
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,600
We have jobs, don’t we?

602
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,640
I lost my job long ago.

603
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,000
Sorry.

604
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,040
I don’t know.

605
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,480
Don’t touch me!

606
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,680
Don’t touch me!

607
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,560
You’ve never been with me at all.

608
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,680
You’ve never seen what I did.

609
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,340
I am selfish!

610
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,780
I should leave you!

611
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,520
Fine.

612
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,400
Yes, I promised you.

613
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,600
We’ll look after Jiang Haoyue until 18.

614
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,600
Then I won’t pay a penny for him!

615
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,880
We’ll divorce!

616
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,640
Mom.

617
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,340
Wenfang.

618
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,420
What to do?

619
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,440
Your dad is ill.

620
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:53,880
Come here now!

621
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,960
Why are you here at this hour?

622
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,000
I don’t want to go home.

623
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,560
My parents are quarrelling.

624
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,340
Would you want some?

625
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,560
I bought two.

626
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,880
Is it good?

627
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,500
Hurry and eat up.

628
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,340
It’s cold here.

629
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,100
Don’t catch a cold.

630
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,760
It’s my fault.

631
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,880
They quarreled

632
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,080
because I don’t study well.

633
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,760
If I had worked harder,

634
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,800
mom wouldn’t have been worried.

635
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,560
Jiang Haoyue.

636
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,560
I must get into top 100 this time.

637
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,560
I’ll help you.

638
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,240
Dad.

639
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,560
Dad.

640
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,400
You are back.

641
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,640
Where is mom?

642
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,880
Your grandpa is ill.

643
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,400
She needs to look after him.

644
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,080
What disease? Is it serious?

645
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,840
Your mom is looking after him.

646
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,200
He’s supposed to be fine.

647
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,520
During this period,

648
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,680
only you and I will be at home.

649
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,600
Dad, haven’t you had dinner?

650
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,320
No, I’m not hungry.

651
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:46,960
It’s sweet.

652
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,400
We can talk.

653
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,180
<i>Math</i>

654
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,960
Six subjects.

655
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,760
All here.

656
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,400
No need to write the composition.

657
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,280
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

658
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,280
It took me hours.

659
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,520
Never mind.

660
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,400
See you at the self-study class.

661
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,120
Three of six subjects are failed.

662
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,080
The composition is good, though.

663
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,520
Of course.

664
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,920
I’m good at it.

665
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,200
Stop bragging.

666
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,080
Keep your word.

667
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,960
One hour at noon break.

668
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,280
One hour before evening classes.

669
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,360
But I’ll only explain for you once.

670
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,040
Stop pretending.

671
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,520
Only once?

672
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,200
Isn’t it enough?

673
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,200
Right. You are not that smart.

674
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,240
You must be kidding.

675
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,680
If I get serious,

676
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,720
I won’t need your help.

677
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,520
If you get serious,

678
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,880
that’ll be really terrifying.

679
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,520
How many times do you explain to her?

680
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,480
Until she understands.

681
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,800
Meng.

682
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,920
You hear that?

683
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,560
He looks down on you

684
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,480
that you can’t understand once.

685
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,120
Anyway, we, the two underachievers,

686
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,920
count on you in study.

687
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:52,944

688
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,520
Fail.

689
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,760
You failed.

690
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,760
You didn’t write your name.

691
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,120
You both failed.

692
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,320
Suddenly so serious.

693
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,720
Are they turning over a new leaf?

694
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,760
They are forced by life.

695
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,880
Does it result in

696
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,160
alternating day and night
or alternating seasons?

697
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,080
Are you listening?

698
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:46,880
Why did you hit me?

699
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,760
This monthly exam was hard,

700
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,840
yet some students’ results

701
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,280
really amazed me.

702
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,600
Feng Kaiqiang rose from 450th to 300th.

703
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,920
Next student also made great progress.

704
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,400
I’m surprised.

705
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,240
It’s

706
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,760
Xiang Weiyao

707
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,960
who rose to 220th place.

708
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,520
Another surprise.

709
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,120
Shi Che rose from 578th place

710
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,560
to 189th place.

711
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,200
He made the biggest progress
in the grade.

712
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,360
At last, we had another classmate

713
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,840
in the top 50.

714
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,920
Lu Miao, the 43rd place.

715
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,000
Great job.

716
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,360
I broke the record!

717
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,320
43rd!

718
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,840
In the pH=1 solution

719
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,440
which contains magnesium ion,

720
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,400
ferrous ion and chloride ion,

721
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,840
the possible anions are...

722
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,480
Many students will choose A.

723
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,760
We’ve got the results!

724
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,800
Because they ignored the stem,

725
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,600
or if ions can coexist
in large quantities...

726
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,240
Guess what my place is!

727
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,120
In the acidic solution.

728
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,560
It should be analyzed from two aspects.

729
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,280
On the one hand,
if the same group of ions

730
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,360
had metathesis reaction

731
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,080
and oxidation-reduction reaction.

732
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,640
On the other,
look at the color of the solution,

733
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,000
namely, the pH.

734
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,640
Well, turn to

735
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,020
page 27.

736
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,360
Analyze the stem.

737
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,480
I’m gonna ask you questions.

738
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,840
Is she so happy for being 43rd place?

739
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,800
It’s easy for underachievers to be happy.

740
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,600
I knew you were not made for basketball.

741
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,760
You aren’t gifted at it,

742
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,400
but you are gifted at study.

743
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,160
Stop.

744
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,960
You promised you wouldn’t interfere

745
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,440
if I got into top 200.

746
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,120
A man

747
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,360
should keep his word.

748
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,120
Gaokao wouldn’t be so easy.

749
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,920
Are you going back on your word?

750
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,840
It’s for your own good.

751
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,640
I’m considering for you.

752
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,360
I know.

753
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,280
I know it’s for me.

754
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,080
But this is my life.

755
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,200
It’s up to me to decide.

756
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,360
I know.

757
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,320
I have no talent for basketball.

758
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,360
But my love for basketball
is more than anyone.

759
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,520
I’ve honored my word.

760
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,800
Will you break your promise?

761
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,960
You chose this path.

762
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,400
You should be responsible for it.

763
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,960
Can I carry on my basketball dream?

764
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,880
You should go to a top sports college.

765
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,000
Don’t fall behind in study.

766
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,840
I know.

767
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,560
Mom.

768
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,120
Guess my place

769
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,320
in this monthly exam.

770
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,440
Sounds like you did well.

771
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,880
Very well.

772
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,000
Within 70th place?

773
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,360
43rd place.

774
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,640
Let me show you a photo.

775
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,200
Okay.

776
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,360
You made great progress.

777
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,880
It’s skyrocketing.

778
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,400
Mom. Are you happy?

779
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,760
Yes.

780
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,120
I can’t be happier.

781
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,640
When will you come back?

782
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,160
I miss you so much.

783
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,820
I miss you, too.

784
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,580
But I have to look after your grandpa.

785
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,700
Dad and I can go to see you

786
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,220
at weekend.

787
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,440
Miao.

788
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,400
If...

789
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,360
Would you like

790
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,120
to live with me?

791
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,160
Yes.

792
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,120
I mean,

793
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,480
with me alone.

794
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,880
I knew you’d be here.

795
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,440
Don’t expose my place.

796
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,560
Why are you hiding here?

797
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,220
Mom and dad only like you.

798
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,580
They don’t like me.

799
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,360
How so?

800
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,800
They praise you that

801
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,120
you are good at everything,

802
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,560
but I’m not good at anything.

803
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,360
They don’t like me.

804
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,520
But when you had a fever,

805
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,440
your mom ran three blocks

806
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,440
to buy chicken feet for you.

807
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,920
Uncle Lu also secretly
gives you pocket money.

808
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,700
Well.

809
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,260
Can you have bad grades in exams?

810
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,680
Don’t listen to teachers.

811
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,000
Try to offend them.

812
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,440
Run around after class.

813
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,320
Don’t be polite to adults.

814
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,160
Rest after dinner.

815
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,040
Don’t wash or dry your clothes yourself.

816
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,000
Don’t tidy up your room.

817
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,200
Don’t have dinner.

818
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,520
Buy snacks instead.

819
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,320
Do you want me to be like you?

820
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:29,920
Yes.

821
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,600
Do as I said.

822
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,880
Or I’ll hit you!

823
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,960
I won’t!

824
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,920
Will you?

825
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,840
I won’t!

826
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,880
Will you?

827
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,920
I won’t!

828
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,360
You are so cute, like Congcong.

829
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,520
Will you?

830
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,520
I won’t!
