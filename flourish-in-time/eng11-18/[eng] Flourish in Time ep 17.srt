When the square array passes rostrum,

32
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:40,080
When the square array passes rostrum,

33
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,560
there will be an area
for class presentation.

34
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,440
Let’s use “Study” as

35
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,400
our theme.

36
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,200
How’s that?

37
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,240
It’s so boring.

38
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,440
Boring.

39
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,480
Shi Che. Do you have
any good suggestions?

40
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,480
I think the formation

41
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,300
needs to show the spirit of our class.

42
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,200
Right?

43
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,880
Right.

44
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,720
“Dominating”.

45
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,600
How about that?

46
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,440
Sir.

47
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,880
This word has too many strokes.

48
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,080
It’s too complicated
to be our formation.

49
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,200
How about

50
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,680
we design a formation
in the shape of Neenya Ninja?

51
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,400
Whenever the leaves arrive,

52
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,960
the fire burns endlessly.

53
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,200
Multiple Shadow Avatar Surgery.

54
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,480
Thank you.

55
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,560
Since you don’t have other ideas,

56
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,160
“Study” will be the final choice.

57
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,840
This word represents

58
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,360
my profound hopes on you.

59
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,760
Keep it in your mind.

60
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,620
It’s so boring.

61
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,800
Forward, march!

62
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,040
Left, right, left.

63
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,080
Halt.

64
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,080
Turn right.

65
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:51,960
You’ve been

66
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,400
working hard these days.

67
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,840
I’ll finish school early today.

68
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,600
Really?

69
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,680
How come we’re the first class
to finish today?

70
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,600
I think Mr. Di is testing us.

71
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,760
Don’t fall into his trap.

72
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,760
Let’s stand still.

73
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,680
Since you don’t want to go,

74
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,400
let’s keep practicing.

75
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,120
We’re joking.

76
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,000
That’s alright.

77
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,580
See you, Sir.

78
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,500
That’s great. Let’s go.

79
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,200
See you.

80
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,980
Take that for me.

81
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,040
Jiang Haoyue,

82
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,720
you’ll be in charge

83
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,440
of formation change.

84
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,620
Go.

85
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,640
Let’s go home.

86
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,600
What are you thinking about?

87
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,920
I’m designing the change of formation.

88
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,320
Let me see.

89
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,920
Come on, let me see.

90
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,560
What’s your class’s idea?

91
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,880
It’s highly classified.

92
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,560
How can I tell you?

93
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,560
It’s the same for me to not tell you.

94
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,600
Suspicious.

95
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,880
Curiosity killed the cat.

96
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,240
But a cat has nine lives.

97
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,720
Jiang. Just let me take a look.

98
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,120
Just a peek.

99
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,120
No.

100
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,800
One peek.

101
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,560
Please?

102
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,520
Just a peek.

103
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,960
- Can’t I just have a look?
- No.

104
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,760
Show me, please.

105
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,880
Where’s it?

106
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,960
In the following pages.

107
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,120
Find it for me.

108
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:44,820
Is it a drip?

109
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,800
The sea?

110
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,000
So the meaning hidden in it is

111
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,260
the water runs into the sea.

112
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,920
Does it mean drops
of water outwear the stone?

113
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,260
It implies the importance
of perseverance,

114
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,360
isn’t it?

115
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,120
Even though that’s not what I mean,

116
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,240
the way you see it is interesting.

117
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,720
Then what’s the original meaning?

118
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,200
See.

119
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,360
If it’s only a drop,

120
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,760
it dries up pretty fast.

121
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,120
But if it drops in the sea,

122
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,680
it’s given enormous power.

123
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,960
It’s just a simple pattern.

124
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,680
How come you could endow it

125
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,720
with such profound meaning?

126
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,520
I...

127
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,800
Do your exercise.

128
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,400
In the training of the square array,

129
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,640
our class has put

130
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,000
much more efforts

131
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,960
than other classes.

132
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,760
You’ve had

133
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,840
complaints

134
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,200
and doubts.

135
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,520
But you did it

136
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,640
eventually.

137
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,040
I’m proud of our class.

138
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,360
The theme of the formation

139
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,720
designed by Jiang Haoyue

140
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,840
is the sea.

141
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,320
Every one of us

142
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,680
is a drop of water.

143
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,400
We have the possibilities
to become the sea.

144
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,080
We are water when we split up.

145
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,260
We are an ocean once
we are gathered together.

146
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,400
There will be a student
to be lifted at the end

147
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,880
representing the honorable drop
of water in our class.

148
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,960
I want

149
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,120
you guys to choose

150
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,960
the student to represent it.

151
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,200
Think about it carefully.

152
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,880
You can vote

153
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,640
by placing the water bottles

154
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,800
in front of the student.

155
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,640
You are pretty popular.

156
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,680
By the way,
which program did you sign up?

157
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,400
The 400-meter relay race.

158
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,520
I signed you up, too.

159
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:02,720
What?

160
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,280
Without even noticing me?

161
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,600
Guoguo.

162
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,840
When we win

163
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,440
the first place of the race,

164
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,040
push me to the podium.

165
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,840
That’ll be my chance to tell everyone

166
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,080
I like Meng.

167
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,880
Che. Haven’t you given up yet?

168
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,080
Actually, I think you...

169
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,000
Stop.

170
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,840
I’ve made up my mind.

171
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,600
Guoguo.

172
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,920
Do you know the meaning
of “Fret not over bygones

173
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,080
and the forward journey take”?

174
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,160
It means,

175
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,640
if you failed on chasing

176
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,040
the girl you like before,

177
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,720
there are plenty of other girls
for us to chase.

178
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,520
You’ll never understand.

179
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,280
Anyway.

180
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,720
The moment I stand on the podium

181
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,440
will be the highlight
of my career and personal life.

182
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,880
Xie Ziye.

183
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,000
I need a favor.

184
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,400
That’s rare.

185
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,000
Are you asking me for a favor?

186
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,640
Can I take a look at your diary?

187
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,120
Why?

188
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,600
I want to keep a diary, too.

189
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,720
Tell me the truth.

190
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:15,880
Don’t you have

191
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,600
the information of other boys in it?

192
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,160
The sports meeting is coming.

193
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,440
I’d like to know my opponents.

194
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,200
Knowing the enemies

195
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,080
helps to win the battles.

196
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:26,840
Isn’t it right?

197
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,240
Tell me the truth.

198
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,000
I signed up for the relay race

199
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
after you encouraged me.

200
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,360
Please help me again.

201
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,840
Xie Ziye.

202
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,080
Stay away from me.

203
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,440
Are you gonna borrow me?

204
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,240
No.

205
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,840
Don’t push me.

206
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,320
What? Are you threatening me now?

207
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,000
Xie Ziye loves reading
romantic fictions!

208
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,000
Are you done now?

209
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,280
It’s been so long.

210
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,660
I don’t care

211
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,400
as long as it still works.

212
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,000
Well?

213
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,720
Just for one night.

214
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,920
Don’t read other things.

215
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,920
Xie Ziye is such a nerd.

216
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,880
Her diary is as tidy
as the experimental form.

217
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,600
That’s crazy.

218
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,120
Where am I? Am I in it?

219
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,600
She only documents
the cute guys in each grade.

220
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,440
Are you in it?

221
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,320
Sure.

222
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,160
<i>Good/Bad Shi Che Cheap-mouthed -5</i>
What’s your score?

223
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,060
<i>Good/Bad Shi Che Cheap-mouthed -5</i>

224
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,800
My score is alright.

225
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,600
Let me see.

226
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,320
Stop it. That’s not the point.

227
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,400
Let’s do the real business.

228
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,320
Wang Feng.

229
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,200
Sprint record, 13’84’’.

230
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,600
Remember that.

231
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,240
Next one.

232
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,000
Yan Su.

233
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,200
Move to the left for a bit.

234
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,440
Here?

235
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,400
Move further.

236
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,600
Here?

237
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,920
Further.

238
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,560
Right here?

239
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,520
Move upwards.

240
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,660
Lower.

241
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,800
Which direction exactly?

242
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,600
Yeah, right here.

243
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,600
I’ll draw here.

244
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,640
Alright.

245
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,520
Miao, you are so good at it.

246
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,200
I’m alright. Top three of the world.

247
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,040
Look at the blackboard.

248
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,600
It looks so nice.

249
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,840
We can probably win a prize
this semester.

250
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,080
Excuse me.

251
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,440
I can’t draw as good.

252
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,920
Thank you.

253
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Her level

254
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,360
can surely win a prize this time.

255
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,800
Don’t stand there watching.

256
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,840
Come and help me.

257
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,040
Go and outline the picture.

258
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,720
Sure.

259
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,000
<i>Good/Bad Shi Che Cheap-mouthed +5</i>

260
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,460
<i>Good/Bad Shi Che Cheap-mouthed +5</i>
He changed his score.

261
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,640
He changed his score.

262
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,520
Narcissist.

263
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,640
Shi Che.

264
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,040
Can you do it right?

265
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,800
It looks good this way.

266
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,760
Trust me.

267
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,920
It’s ugly.

268
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,400
Draw evenly, okay?

269
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,320
This is art.

270
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,400
Can you understand?

271
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,520
It looks better this way.

272
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,080
Lu Miao.

273
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,280
Go to the medical room now.

274
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,480
Jiang Haoyue passed out just now.

275
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,640
Passed out?

276
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,660
He’s fine. He had sunstroke.

277
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,680
Some Huoxiang Zhengqi liquid
will help him.

278
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,840
Sir.

279
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,800
Let’s forget it.

280
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,960
Jiang Haoyue has been working hard

281
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,660
during the practice of the array.

282
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,120
Let’s find someone else

283
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,280
to finish the final lift.

284
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,280
If we cancel it,

285
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,240
the guys will surely understand it.

286
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,360
The official presentation is tomorrow.

287
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,240
The time is limited.

288
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,400
Give me the medicine.

289
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,760
I’ll talk to him.

290
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,360
Jiang.

291
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,080
It’s time for your medicine.

292
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,960
Hurry up and get better.

293
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,860
So you can finish the final lift.

294
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,160
You’re not asking me to quit?

295
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,520
I know you won’t quit.

296
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,000
Actually,

297
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,640
I’m not too sure about it.

298
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,280
What’s your concern?

299
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,080
Do you think

300
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,320
they can catch me?

301
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,280
What are you doing?

302
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,840
Be quiet, Ziye.

303
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,920
Let me ask you something.

304
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,440
You’ve learned so much
from the romantic fictions.

305
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,600
You must be good
at writing love letters, right?

306
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,840
Love letters?

307
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,040
Are you writing Lu Miao a love letter?

308
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,840
Yeah.

309
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,320
When I win the first place
of the relay race,

310
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,160
I’ll tell her my feelings
in front of everybody.

311
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,920
Try and win first.

312
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,000
I am Shi Che.

313
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,040
There’s nothing to worry about.

314
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,600
But,

315
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,360
I’m afraid I’ll have a stage fright

316
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,440
when I stand on the podium.

317
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,640
That will be awkward.

318
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,640
You are her best friend.

319
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,560
Can you help me out?

320
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,240
How about

321
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,840
when it’s done,

322
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,760
I’ll

323
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,560
buy you

324
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,000
a gift pack of diary appliances?

325
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,960
Really?

326
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,960
Really.

327
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,120
I’ll keep my promise.

328
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,280
Alright.

329
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,400
I think

330
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,000
when you profess your love
for her publicly,

331
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,280
your love letter needs to be elegant.

332
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,400
Remember what I’m about to say.

333
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,320
Dirt with its fresh smell.

334
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,400
A generation filled with energy.

335
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,200
Songs lift our spirit.

336
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,680
De...

337
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,360
Desert nourished by the rain.

338
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,640
My words imply strong affections
for you.

339
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,640
That’s the first part.

340
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,200
Finish the rest of it yourself.

341
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,280
I was right to ask you.

342
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,000
Thank you. See you.

343
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,280
Be careful.

344
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,280
Why are we here?

345
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,720
Right here. Stop here.

346
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,120
Where’s this place?

347
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,840
Hurry up.

348
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,720
Come on.

349
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,920
Right here.

350
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,760
I watched your class practice last time.

351
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,440
I found the point of your movement is

352
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,840
to use the strength of your thigh
and straighten your back.

353
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,640
Are you sure?

354
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,160
I’m the master.

355
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,400
Stand still at here.

356
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,520
What are you...?

357
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,160
Look at my movement.

358
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:35,960
After I count three, two, one,

359
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,160
you come and catch me.

360
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,880
No. It’s too dangerous.

361
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,120
Come down.

362
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,720
Three...

363
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,520
Stop it.

364
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,320
Two...

365
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,520
Let’s change to a lower place,

366
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,440
okay?

367
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,760
One...

368
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:52,880
Are you okay?

369
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,480
Yes.

370
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,560
Are you okay?

371
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,240
I’m fine.

372
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,760
Do you know how dangerous

373
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,800
it is to fall from this high?

374
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,920
What if you get hurt?

375
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,100
The students in your class
will be like you.

376
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,320
Just like you care about me,

377
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,760
they care about you, too.

378
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,760
It’s like I trust myself with you.

379
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,960
As long as you can trust them.

380
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,560

381

your formation will succeed, too.

<i>The 48th Sports Meeting</i>
Class 1, Grade 2 is coming.

383
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,200
Wide sky and enormous ocean.
Heavy rain falls down.

384
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,240
They are presenting
the formation of ocean.

385
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,800
Halt.

Turn right.

387
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,840
Dress right.

388
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,960
Eyes front.

389
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,160
Waves. Ready.

Change.

391
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,520
Not bad.

392
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,880
Arrow.

393
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,680
Change.

394
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,200
You are the next one.

395
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,640
Water drop.

396
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,320
Change.

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,480
Excuse me.

398

It’s the 400-meter relay race.

484

The first team competing

485

Why are you holding it?

498

520
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,520
Let’s congratulate Class 10, Grade 1

521
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,200
for winning the final

522
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,280
of the relay race!

523
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,680
Miao.

524
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,080
Ziye.

525
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,520
Great! That’s great!

526
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,440
So cool.

527
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,000
Great!

528
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,840
Don’t be so excited.
That’s what I expected.

529
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,000
Are you tired?

530
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,760
No.

531
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,880
Guys, listen to me.

532
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,440
Shi Che’s last hurdle

533
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,840
was unbelievable!

534
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,800
I think Shi Che should accept the prize

535
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,760
on behalf of our class.

536
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,320
Sure!

537
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,960
Great!

538
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,560
You read the first part

539
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,440
of this speech,

540
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,320
and I’ll read the second part.

541
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:47,720
Sure.

542
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,840
Then let’s practice it together.

543
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,920
This speech is my acceptance speech.

544
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,440
Read it for me
when I accept the prize later.

545
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,080
Alright.

546
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,000
Read it in my tone.

547
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,960
Read it with affections
to manifest my demeanor.

548
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,960
Read it in your best condition.

549
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,920
Help me to express the pride
between the lines.

550
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,840
Thanks.

551
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,720
Cheer for me!

552
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,160
Louder!

553
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,600
Dirt...

554
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,360
A generation...

555
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,200
Songs...

556
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:20,800
Desert...

557
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,920
My words...

558
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,560
Are you sure about reading it?

559
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,600
I’ll read Shi Che’s

560
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,040
speech.

561
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,160
You?

562
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,080
Aren’t you...?

563
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,000
Let’s welcome Principle Shi

564
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,560
to present the prize

565
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,240
for the winner of the 400-meter

566
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,360
relay race.

567
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,960
Shi Che.

568
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,680
Here, come on.

569
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,480
According to the request of Shi Che,

570
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,240
we’re reading his acceptance speech
at this glorious moment.

571
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,960
Dirt with its fresh smell.

572
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,640
A generation filled with energy.

573
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,340
Songs lift our spirit.

574
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,280
Desert nourished by the rain.

575
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,520
What did Shi Che write?

576
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,800
My words imply strong affections
for you.

577
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,080
I’ve given all I have.

578
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,000
Just because you are here.

579
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,100
I have a bad feeling.

580
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,320
You left a smile in my heart.

581
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,840
I don’t ask for much.

582
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,000
As long as there’s a corner

583
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,880
for me to lay my eyes

584
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,340
on you with my deepest love.

585
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,320
A memory which I’ll never

586
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,400
regret for the rest of my life.

587
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,840
I’d like to give this medal

588
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,720
to the person I love.

589
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,920
My dearest father, Principle Shi.

590
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,560
Son.

591
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,160
You are my dearest son.

592
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,760
Is that so funny?

593
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,800
You don’t get it.

594
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,880
He’s really miserable and funny.

595
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,440
I think it’s a good speech.

596
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,160
Good for you.

597
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,920
Lift your arms.

598
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,440
No matter what,

599
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,520
you’ve improved the relationship

600
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,800
between you and your father.

601
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,200
Don’t ever mention this again.

602
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,640
Do you think it was a prank by Ziye?

603
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,200
I think

604
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,760
she may have written

605
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,720
an acrostic poetry by accident.

606
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,760
Alright. It’s definitely a prank.

607
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,000
But Jiang Haoyue was worse.

608
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,560
He’s so annoying.

609
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,320
He’s extremely treacherous.

610
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,200
He replaced your speech.

611
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,080
This act is very

612
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,640
irritating

613
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,320
and shameless.

614
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,400
I’ll get even with him for sure.

615
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,400
Jiang.

616
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,120
Uncle Lu.

617
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,000
Throwing the trash?

618
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,040
Yeah, I am.

619
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,760
I need to throw them first.

620
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:25,960
Jiang.

621
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,400
Have you had dinner?

622
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,200
Here. Jiang.

623
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,440
Well. Enjoy your food.

624
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,600
Thank you, Sir.

625
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,520
No problem.

626
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,120
Come on. Jiang.

627
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:55,880
Eat now.

628
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:04,720
Uncle Lu.

629
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,000
Did you pay for my artificial leg?

630
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,640
Of course not.

631
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,160
What are you thinking about?

632
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,600
Jiang, you should thank
your father for it.

633
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,760
Here comes your food.

634
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,440
Thanks.

635
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,680
My father?

636
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,920
Your father cares about you a lot.

637
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,400
You are

638
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,560
a great kid.

639
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,720
But I have to say sometimes

640
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,840
you’re too suspicious.

641
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,000
When have I ever lied to you?

642
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,720
I’m sorry.

643
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,520
That’s not what I mean.

644
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,880
No, Uncle Lu.

645
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,880
I shouldn’t have been mad at you

646
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,120
that day by the roads.

647
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,240
It’s the past.

648
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,240
Let’s forget it.

649
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,480
Aren’t

650
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,360
you mad at me?

651
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,640
I don’t get mad so easily.

652
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,080
If I was always mad,

653
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,800
I would have been mad
at Miao for millions of times.

654
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,960
Here. Eat some vegetables.

655
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,600
Have a rib.

656
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:25,760
Is it good?

657
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,400
Not as special as Aunt Fang’s cooking.

658
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,080
The ribs cooked by her

659
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,760
are real cuisine.

660
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,760
Jiang.

661
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,280
I still remember

662
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,480
when you just replaced your leg

663
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,520
and came for dinner for the first time.

664
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:51,880
I remember, too.

665
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,440
That was

666
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,360
the first time I went to your home.

667
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,880
Lu Miao was sitting next to me.

668
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,280
She was curious about my artificial leg
when I came in.

669
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,520
She wanted

670
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,520
to have a same one as mine.

671
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,760
I was so mad

672
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,800
that I pounded the desk

673
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,720
so hard with the chopstick

674
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,520
in my hand.

675
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,760
Then it occurred

676
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,640
to me that she was just a kid.

677
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,720
Miao was very upset, too.

678
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,160
She asked me later

679
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,680
how come

680
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,480
you could be the RoboCop

681
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,800
but not her.

682
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,680
And if she was ignored by God.

683
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,000
That’s really her style.

684
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,800
Jiang.

685
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,960
You haven’t come to my home
for dinner for long.

686
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,200
Come again someday.

687
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,120
Tell me whatever you want to eat.

688
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,760
Aunt Fang and I will cook for you.

689
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,600
Okay.

690
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,600
Are you still yearning
for ribs cooked by her?

691
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,120
Yes.

692
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,720
Alright.

693
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,800
Here. Uncle Lu.

694
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,080
When the Big Bang happened,

695
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,240
atom was formed

696
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,480
which made the stars.

697
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,880
The atoms which I mentioned

698
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,280
constituted our bodies.

699
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,880
So, the stars are not far away.

700
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,960
Because we are the stars.

701
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,800
We are the stars?

702
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,840
When I look at you,
I’m looking at the stars.

703
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,680
That’s kind of true.

704
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,240
So the stars are so close to me.

705
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,240
The nearest star is yourself.

706
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:36,800
Really?

707
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:37,840
Yes.

708
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,840
I’m the star?
