00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:39,940
<i>Advancing “Enemy”</i>
could you tell me,

33
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,000
could you tell me,

34
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,840
if I could be physically better,

35
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,240
weight more,

36
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,840
and run faster…

37
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,480
I admire that, Jiang.

38
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,480
You adapt well to the artificial limb.

39
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,240
It won’t be hard for you.

40
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,600
You need professional

41
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,280
physical training.

42
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,560
Technically you can make it.

43
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,080
But if I’m right,

44
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,240
you’ve been wearing it for years.

45
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,320
To prevent possible harms,

46
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,600
I suggest you change

47
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,160
a more flexible one.

48
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,160
I see.

49
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,100
Thank you, doctor.

50
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,820

00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,880
What happened to them?

53
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,000
He went to the Draft with his friend.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,440
His friend was out

55
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,160
and he was in.

56
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,080
That was

57
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,400
a friendship-killing test.

58
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,000
Guoguo must feel awkward.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,920
I bet

60
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,160
he’d quit.

61
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,560
Well,

62
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,400
I’ll quit.

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,900
No!

64
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,520
Guoguo loves basketball.

65
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,240
He won’t join the school squad

66

I won’t join the school squad

68
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,480
at the price of a friend.

69
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,760
Well,

70
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,960
will Negative Score agree?

71
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,760
As childish as Che is,

72
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,040
he will.

73
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,680
Fine!

74
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,900
Wanna quit?

75
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,560
Beat me first.

76
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,840
Are you nuts?

77
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,120
Even my father won’t do that.

78
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,520
Show me what you have.

79
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,560
Wow…

80
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,840
That’s why they picked you.

Che,

84
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,820
you brought me to the court.

85
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:29,880
You talk too much.

86
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:30,640
You serve.

87
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,120
Come on!

88
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,720
Seems Negative Score isn’t selfish.

89

Guoguo is his best friend, anyway.

90

But,

91
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,200
he must be heartbroken

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,880
for losing the draft,

93
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,820
though he didn’t complain.

94
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,760
What’s wrong?

95
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,760
Nothing.

98
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,820
why have vain regrets and mourn alone?

You are the last one.

But the future is bright

There’s no way

00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,680
for you to memorize it like this.

116
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,320
When reciting Classical Chinese,
you need to follow the logic.

117
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,440
What logic?

118
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,480
I think their words have no logic.

119
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,560
Do you know the meaning

120
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,080
of the sentence you recited?

121
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,920
How come you didn’t write
any notes down?

122
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,800
This sentence means

123
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,320
since the soul is dominated by body,

124
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,240
there’s no point of feeling
depressed and lonely.

125
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,000
What’s done in the past is done.

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,240
But your future is filled
with possibilities.

127
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,160
It means you haven’t gone astray too far.

128
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,520
Do you get it now?

129
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:15,960
Yes.

130
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,960
Repeat the meaning

131
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,520
of the sentence.

132
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,120
Well...

133
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,800
This sentence means

134
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,000
since you’ve met difficulties
playing basketball,

135
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,480
you should find a chance
to prove yourself?

136
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,120
What I said in the bookstore

137
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,760
is a little bit mean.

138
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,920
I apologize.

139
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,360
You

140
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,360
apologize to me?

141
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,160
Are you okay?

142
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,040
I just think people
who chase their dreams

143
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,280
deserve to be respected.

144
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,680
You finally know how excellent I am.

145
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,520
Alright.

146
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,080
Don’t be too proud
about a few compliments.

147
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,560
The new head teacher is annoying.

148
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,160
Why do we have to move to another floor?

149
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,280
I think it’s great.

150
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,800
I don’t want to stay in the first floor

151
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,800
for three whole hours.

152
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,200
It’s too heavy.

153
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,040
Excuse me.
Which floor are you moving to?

154
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,640
The second floor.

155
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,480
Let’s go.

156
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,760
What’s happening?

157
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,040
We are moving to the floor of Grade 2.

158
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,440
Let’s go upstairs together.

159
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,720
What are you doing?

160
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,840
I’m getting my things.

161
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,400
Lu Miao took them for you.

162
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,320
Let’s go.

163
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,400
Lu Miao?

164
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,920
Come on. She’s right there.

165
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:02,960
Did you hear?

166
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,400
Class one of Grade 2 moved
to the second floor.

167
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,280
I know.

168
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,200
But why?

169
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,560
We’re in the middle of this semester.

170
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,760
Why would they move all of a sudden?

171
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,200
For a simple reason.

172
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,880
They had a new head teacher.

173
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,600
A new teacher applying new measures.

174
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,440
He needs to do something
to prove himself.

175
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,960
They are the experimental class.

176
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,880
This semester is vital to them.

177
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,400
Besides.

178
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,680
Many students applied
for No.1 High School

179
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,200
just for their former head teacher, Mr. Chen.

180
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,960
I don’t know
why they changed to a new one.

181
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,040
I’m curious about this gossip.

182
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,040
Mr. Chen

183
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,360
is poached by the high school next to us.

184
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,160
A teacher got poached
by the rival high school.

185
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,760
Your father must be mad.

186
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,760
He’s so mad
that he doesn’t have time for me.

187
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,520
He makes countless calls every day.

188
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,400
He said he has to find

189
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:48,620
the key to defeat the other high school.

190
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,180
<i>Collection of Guitar Solos</i>
the key to defeat the other high school.

191
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,440
the key to defeat the other high school.

192
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,840
The new teacher must be very good.

193
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,800
I’m not sure.

194
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,720
But his does have a unique name.

195
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,280
What’s his name?

196
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,240
Di Ren.

197
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,400
Enemy?

198
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,440
That’s an aggressive name.

199
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,660
Where’s Guoguo?

200
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,240
Let’s go.

201
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,720
Sorry.

202
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,660
I’m sorry. Did I crumple your book?

203
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,040
It’s fine.

204
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,480
Even if you did, it’s okay.

205
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,400
I’ve already memorized it all.

206
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,320
This book is too easy.

207
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,120
Actually I...

208
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,000
Let’s go.

209
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,000
Actually, I’m good at playing guitar.

210
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,200
I can accompany for you.

211
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,440
Can you play guitar for me?

212
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,520
You heard it all.

213
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,880
Play for me, please?

214
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,640
Forget it. Let’s play basketball.

215
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,880
So humiliating.

216
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,280
Let’s go.

217
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,600
All rise.

218
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,360
Hello, teacher.

219
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,540
Hello, students.

220
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,540
Please sit down.

221
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Is there anyone

222
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,440
in our class who’s been

223
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,960
absent from the gym class?

224
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,040
Sir.

225
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,960
Jiang Haoyue...

226
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,200
Are you sick?

227
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,760
No.

228
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,600
Great.

229
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,800
Then, starting from today,

230
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,120
you have to go to the gym class, too.

231
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,960
Alright.
Turn to the third chapter of the book.

232
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,280
Organic Compounds.

233
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,540
One and two

234
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,120
and three and four.

235
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,080
Two and two

236
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,540
and three and four.

237
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,840
Three and two and...

238
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,520
Jiang Haoyue.

239
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,660
Four and five...

240
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,880
Is he having the gym class?

241
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,880
Seven and eight...

242
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,880
Four and two and three and four.

243
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,960
Five and six and seven...

244
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,400
Let’s drop it.

245
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,320
Jiang Haoyue has never taken
the gym class before.

246
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,000
It was before.

247
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
If he’s absent from it again,

248
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,920
I’ll count it as truant.

249
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,280
My enemy.

250
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,520
Mr. Di is outrageous.

251
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,320
Why are you so mad?

252
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,800
Why isn’t Jiang Haoyue mad?

253
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,440
What’s the point of being mad?

254
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,160
If he really doesn’t care,

255
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,400
why doesn’t he insist on it?

256
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,500
If it’s me,

257
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,860
I’d definitely not take the class.

258
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,640
That’s what you think.

259
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,360
But it’s Jiang Haoyue.

260
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,480
He prefers to keep everything to himself.

261
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,400
No.

262
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,560
I have to fight for him.

263
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,840
What are you doing?

264
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,480
Writing to the principle.

265
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,940
<i>Principal’s Office</i>

266
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,080
Principle Shi.

267
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,760
You don’t say.

268
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,800
This student’s style of writing is good.

269
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,920
That is not the point.

270
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,240
I know.

271
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,960
The letter of complaint

272
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,880
says that I aimed at Jiang Haoyue.

273
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,320
Jiang Haoyue

274
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,160
is the seeded student
who’s hopeful to get into

275
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,120
Tsinghua and Peking Universities.

276
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,440
Surely

277
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,640
every teacher

278
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,880
has its own teaching method.

279
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,800
But I still hope that you can

280
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,440
make an exception for Jiang Haoyue.

281
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,240
After all,
his leg is a little inconvenient.

282
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,040
I’ve told you about this

283
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,520
when you first came.

284
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,320
Don’t worry, Principle. I got it.

285
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,900
I’d make exceptions for him

286
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,020
when it’s necessary.

287
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,080
Before I came here,

288
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,520
I consulted a doctor in the hospital.

289
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,120
The morning exercises, gym class,

290
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,960
and walking in the parade.

291
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,360
Jing Haoyue is capable of doing them all.

292
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,840
But the special treatments he got

293
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,800
have driven him away from the class.

294
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,000
I’m worrying

295
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,760
that his future

296
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,520
may be more difficult.

297
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,400
The grades of exams

298
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,280
are just outcomes received
in a period of time.

299
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,440
Making students

300
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,440
learn to find their positions in the class.

301
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,760
Teach them to work with other people

302
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,080
while working on themselves.

303
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,160
That’s the kind of education
that benefits them in long term.

304
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,320
I was right about you.

305
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,600
I’ll fully support your work
in the future.

306
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,960
How long?

307
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,320
Six seconds and seven.

308
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,480
No.

309
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,920
I have to make it in within six seconds.

310
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,600
How long have you practiced?

311
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
It’s been a while.

312
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,280
If you’ve started to practice

313
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,240
your physical agility privately.

314
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,240
Why would you refuse
to go to the gym class?

315
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,120
I want to improve my agility
to a certain level first.

316
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,720
I can’t let watch

317
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,120
me embarrassing myself.

318
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,660
That’s your concern.

319
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,920
Then why is it okay for me to watch you?

320
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,320
You’ve done more humiliating things.

321
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,000
I really

322
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,240
should change an artificial leg.

323
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,660
Our school is having a ports meeting.

324
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,140
<i>Class 10, Grade 1</i>
In the unit of class,

325
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,400
every class has to have a square array.

326
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,640
All members need to attend it.

327
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,840
So, starting from today,

328
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,040
we’d use the last self-studying class

329
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,640
to practice for the square array.

330
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,880
But don’t let it delay your studying.

331
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,200
Ziye, are you signing up for anything?

332
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,080
No.

333
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,360
- Ziye, let’s do it.
- No.

334
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,680
Everybody stands in their position
of the gym class.

335
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,240
Eleven students required in a line.

336
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,480
Four lines in total.

337
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,680
We have forty-five students, right?

338
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,160
There’s one missing.

339
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,320
Sir.

340
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,640
I didn’t count Jiang Haoyue in.

341
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,040
Where is he?

342
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,840
He’s in the classroom.

343
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,120
Get him here.

344
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,760
Go.

345
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:51,760
Okay.

346
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,640
Jiang Haoyue.

347
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,040
Mr. Di is asking you to go down
for the square array.

348
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,760
He said we can only start

349
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,200
once everybody is there.

350
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,200
There’s no need for that.

351
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,480
Alright.

352
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,720
What’s wrong with their class?

353
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,840
Are they being punished?

354
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,900
Left, right, left.

355
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,740
Halt.

356
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,000
Sir.

357
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,240
Jiang Haoyue said...

358
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:29,840
Said...

359
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Don’t stutter.

360
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,080
Jiang Haoyue said there’s no need
to wait for him.

361
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:38,480
Go back.

362
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,400
Guys.

363
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,960
I know you’re clear
who we’re waiting for.

364
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,360
As long as he doesn’t come,

365
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,720
today’s school won’t be over.

366
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,920
Jiang Haoyue.

367
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,840
Come down.

368
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,920
Stop wasting our time.

369
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,960
Your grades are good

370
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,880
but we still have homework to do.

371
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,000
Hurry up and come down.

372
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,440
I need to go
to the tutoring class later.

373
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,520
Why doesn’t he come down?

374
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,240
Why do you aim at him?

375
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,760
Why do you think so?

376
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,280
As his head teacher,

377
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,400
don’t you know

378
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,880
his basic information?

379
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,800
I do.

380
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,360
Then why do you ask him to do all this?

381
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,840
So, in your opinion,

382
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,640
you think I need to make an exception

383
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,200
for Jiang Haoyue just
because of his disability?

384
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:42,560
No...

385
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,840
Mr. Di,
I don’t need a special treatment.

386
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,720
I apologize to you.

387
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,800
Why would you apologize?

388
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,680
Mr. Di.

389
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,000
Sorry.

390
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,600
The student in my class is naughty.

391
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,400
I’ll take her back to discipline her.

392
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:09,880
Alright.

393
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,880
Mr. Wen.

394
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:11,880
Lu Miao.

395
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,340
We’ll go first.

396
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,480
Jiang Haoyue...

397
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,600
Lu Miao.

398
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,920
What’s the matter with you?

399
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,100
I got distracted for one minute

400
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,600
and you went to meddle
other class’s business.

401
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,280
I’ll go in the line now.

402
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,040
Now, everybody’s here.

403
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,160
Let’s start the training.

404
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,560
Everyone. Dress right.

405
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,440
Eyes front.

406
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,320
Turn right.

407
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,400
Forward, march.

408
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,640
Left, right, left.

409
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,440
March on the stop.

410
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,720
Left, right, left.

411
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,760
Forward, march.

412
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,200
Left, right, left.

413
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,340
Left, right, left.

414
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,200
Turn left.

415
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:09,000
Left, right, left.

416
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,200
Turn left.

417
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,240
Left, right, left.

418
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,080
Upright.

419
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,800
Left, right, left.

420
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,520
Jiang Haoyue, follow up.

421
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,240
Pay attention to the rhythm.

422
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:32,160
Left, right, left.

423
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,560
Halt.

424
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,600
Turn left.

425
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,520
Dress right.

426
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,560
Eyes front.

427
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,000
At ease.

428
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,640
This time should be okay.

429
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,480
I’m really tired of it.

430
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,760
Jiang Haoyue is in our team.

431
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,440
There’s no way we can walk in line.

432
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,720
I think it’s good enough.

433
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,800
Jiang Haoyue.

434
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,400
Stand in the middle.

435
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,100
Sir.

436
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,760
It would look more in order

437
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,680
if Jiang Haoyue walks on the side.

438
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,160
I’m afraid he can’t catch up walking
in the middle.

439
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,400
The array would be look worse.

440
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,640
Then practice until you walk in order.

441
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,200
How can we practice more?

442
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,320
It’s impossible for us
to be in order anyway.

443
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,320
Now he’s standing in the middle.

444
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,840
If we could walk in order,

445
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,280
we’d be able to walk
in the Olympics opening ceremony.

446
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,680
Sir.

447
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,520
I want to stand in the middle, too.

448
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,400
Jiang Haoyue.

449
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,480
Stand next to Qu Wei.

450
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,640
Let’s have a rest first.

451
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,880
We’ll try later.

452
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,880
Thanks.

453
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,960
I’m good.

454
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,600
Drink some and take a break.

455
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,320
I’ll put it here.

456
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:57,480
It’s fine.

457
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,520
Meng. Are you still thinking about that?

458
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,560
Jiang Haoyue doesn’t know to fight back.

459
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,840
He only knows to tolerate.

460
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,240
What should we do?

461
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,240
Think about it backwards.

462
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,160
Maybe Jiang Haoyue’s way
of dealing it is more reasonable.

463
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,880
Your sticking up for him

464
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,200
may embarrass him instead.

465
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,760
Do you think he doesn’t need our help?

466
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,800
I don’t think so.

467
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,840
We aren’t happy about this thing, too.

468
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,120
Isn’t it? Che.

469
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,960
Yes.

470
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,640
So, I didn’t think too much.

471
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,100
We can’t indulge evil to foster.

472
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,520
Justice may be late,

473
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,800
but it always comes.

474
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,680
We have to teach them a lesson
for Jiang Haoyue.

475
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,240
Alright.

476
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,600
For Jiang Haoyue!

477
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,960
For justice!

478
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,320
For justice!

479
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,100
Jiang Yi.

480
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,280
I can’t repay you.

481
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,280
I don’t have money.

482
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,280
Did you borrow money from others again?

483
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,160
It’s you.

484
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,840
What are you doing?

485
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,800
Jiang Yi.

486
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,200
Look at you now.

487
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,080
Fine.

488
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,200
I’m drunk.

489
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,720
I’m not sober.

490
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,560
I won’t remember

491
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,600
anything you say now.

492
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,100
Listen.

493
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,000
Haoyue is almost eighteen now.

494
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,680
His body has grown.

495
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,320
The current artificial leg
isn’t suitable for him anymore.

496
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,400
You have to take him to the factory
to get a new one.

497
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,080
Do you hear me?

498
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,880
What do you mean?

499
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,760
Do you want to get rid of him?

500
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,000
I’m telling you.

501
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,680
I don’t care if he’s eighteen now.

502
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,560
You have to be responsible

503
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,600
for my son the entire life.

504
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,680
Do you understand?

505
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,100
Don’t scream.

506
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,240
I’m begging you.

507
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,440
Don’t scream, alright?

508
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,920
Don’t scream.

509
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,880
I’m telling you.

510
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,720
I didn’t mean to get rid of him.

511
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,480
Jiang Haoyue...

512
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,200
Jiang Haoyue is my son, too.

513
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,880
Keep the receipt of the artificial leg.

514
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,640
I will

515
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,480
give you the money later.

516
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,840
You used to take him to buy new ones.

517
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,720
I’m not familiar with the factory.

518
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,280
Why would you let me take him?

519
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,280
Stop screaming.

520
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,680
Listen to me.

521
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,320
Haoyue probably

522
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,920
won’t let me take him.

523
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,600
I’ve written down
the model number on it.

524
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,280
Get the hydraulic one.

525
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,440
Take it.

526
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,480
Keep it. Don’t lose it.

527
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,200
Keep it well.

528
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,340
Don’t give me the money later.

529
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,000
Just give it to me now.

530
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,280
I don’t have money.

531
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,120
You know it.

532
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,440
I’ve got nothing in my pocket.

533
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,840
Promise me.

534
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,920
Only spend the money
on buying artificial leg.

535
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,600
I’m that kid’s father.

536
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,640
I’ll send you the password later.

537
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,000
Alright.

Why did you transfer me thirty thousand?

540
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,800
Don’t you need a new artificial leg?

541
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,560
I know there’s a hydraulic type.

542
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,160
Check it

543
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,280
and buy it later.

544
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,560
Where did you get the money?

545
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,640
It’s not your business.

546
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,100
Who did you borrow it from?

547
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:23,760
Is it an usurious loan?

548
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,440
Or did you borrow it from Uncle Lu?

549
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,400
What a bad luck!

550
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,960
Can’t believe it.

551
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,340
I won it.

552
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:35,960
Is that okay?

553
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,040
Listen.

554
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,680
Don’t ever be so stubborn again.

555
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,960
Are you gonna buy it?

556
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,080
Give back the money if you don’t.

557
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,180
<i>No. 1 High School</i>

558
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,800
It’s confirmed.

559
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,760
That’s Jiang Haoyue’s class.

560
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,960
They are having
the physical examination.

561
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,760
Where’s Jiang Haoyue?

562
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,560
He went to the playground
after the examination.

563
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,560
Now it’s the time.

564
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,080
Let’s hurry up.

565
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,720
Go!

566
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,100
Take the shoes.

567
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,520
They are coming.

568
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,600
Hurry. Let’s hide.

569
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,480
How’s your eye test?

570
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,440
My glasses are so thick.

571
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,920
I don’t think I’ll pass.

572
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,080
My left eye is only 0.2.

573
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,440
Where’s my other shoe?

574
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:30,960
Mine is gone, too.

575
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,400
Did someone took it wrong?

576
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,520
What happened?

577
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,200
Who is it?

578
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,720
Now you’ve suffered.

579
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,720
Who are you?

580
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,000
We are the Heroic Firearm Alliance.

581
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,440
You felt so bad just because

582
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,560
you lost your shoes.

583
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,100
Have you ever thought

584
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,960
about how you’d feel if one of your leg

585
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,720
is disabled?

586
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:49,800
Exactly.

587
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,040
Just think about it.

588
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,680
That’s right.

589
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,920
If you ever be sarcastic to Jiang Haoyue

590
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,100
again in the future,

591
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,000
you won’t just lose your shoes.

592
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,240
You’ll lose your socks, too.

593
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,680
Don’t tell them the detail.

594
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,480
It doesn’t sound scary anymore.

595
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,080
Alright.

596
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,720
We are only here to teach you a lesson.

597
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,040
So that you can remember us,

598
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,600
the Heroic Turkey Alliance.

599
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,040
It’s the Heroic Firearm Alliance.

600
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,600
We, the Heroic Firearm Alliance

601
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,840
will keep an eye on you.

602
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,480
Are you finished?

603
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,760
Give us back our shoes.

604
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,780
Let’s go.

605
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,320
Don’t run! Hey.

606
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,840
You’re finally back.

607
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,000
I was getting nervous.

608
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,340
It’s a pity that you missed it.

609
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,800
You have no idea how cool we were.

610
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,560
I designed that pose on purpose.

611
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,960
I wonder if they know who we are.

612
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,000
No way.

613
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,280
We used the magic in Naruto.

614
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,200
You are surprisingly positive.

615
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,080
What do you know?

616
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:48,960
Do you know magic?

617
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,440
Do you know the Sharingan?

618
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,120
You spit on me.

619
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,440
The Heroic Turkey Alliance.

620
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,000
I think,

621
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,400
they were Lu Miao, Shi Che

622
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,640
and Chen Guoguo.

623
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,680
It must be them.

624
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,080
Who else would be so stupid?

625
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,720
No. I have to inform
our teacher about this.

626
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,560
They have to be punished.

627
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,340
Alright.

628
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,100
Though they were dramatic.

629
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,600
Were they wrong?

630
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,800
Think about it.

631
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,280
The training of the square array

632
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,120
was to help unifying our class.

633
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,920
Jiang Haoyue has won

634
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,340
many honors for our class.

635
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,400
But it’s indeed hard for him

636
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,280
to walk in the array.

637
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,680
We probably need to

638
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,960
stand under the sun longer

639
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,200
and sweat more because of him.

640
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,040
But we are a team.

641
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,680
Shouldn’t we consider

642
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,480
for and care for every classmate?

643
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,800
If we aren’t united,

644
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,160
there’s no way for the square array
to be in order.

645
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,280
Hurry up.

646
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,840
Jiang Haoyue has probably started
his training now.

647
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,680
Why haven’t they come?

648
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,920
Go and take a rest.

649
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,720
Continue your training after they come.

650
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,440
I’m fine.

651
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,480
I came down to practice.

652
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,960
I don’t need a break.

653
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,520
I don’t need
to be taken care of, either.

654
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,240
I’m ready

655
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,640
anytime.

656
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,240
Alright.

657
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,280
Halt.

658
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,000
March on the stop. Go.

659
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:23,520
Left, right, left.

660
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,640
Left.

661
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:35,520
Left, right, left.

662
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,880
Keep up with the pace.

663
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,960
Align on all sides.

664
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,920
Left, right, left.

665
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,920
Show me your spirit.

666
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,180
Upright.

667
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:12,720
Left, right, left.

668
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,960
Jiang Haoyue needs us

669
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,480
to stick up for him.

670
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,920
Why is he looking at me all the time?

671
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,080
Did he find out what we did?

672
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,840
It’s fine if he did.

673
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,200
We did it for his sake.

674
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,760
Even though what we did wasn’t glorious.

675
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,640
I don’t want him to know.

676
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,480
What if he doesn’t appreciate it?

677
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,480
Then what I did
just pushed him even further.

678
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,680
Lu...

679
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,320
Did he have to chase me?

680
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,520
Wait.

681
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,320
Why did you run?

682
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,840
You chased me. So I ran.

683
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,440
How can you run so fast now?

684
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,680
A few days ago,

685
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,520
my father bought me
a new artificial leg.

686
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,920
A new one?

687
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,920
You...

688
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,080
Why have you been hiding me?

689
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,640
Didn’t you say you don’t want
to see me anymore?

690
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,600
Why would you think so?

691
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,960
I know you had a fight with my dad.

692
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,480
Sorry.

693
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,480
All these years,

694
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,240
I’ve been forcing you
to be friends with me.

695
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,400
I should apologize.

696
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,080
I was too emotional a few days ago.

697
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,000
I even said terrible things to Uncle Lu.

698
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,680
Then I let out my anger to you.

699
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,520
Then why did you say

700
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,840
I have a choice

701
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,040
but you don’t?

702
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,120
I didn’t mean it.

703
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,640
Can you forgive me?

704
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,840
Well...

705
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,960
Are we still friends?

706
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,960
Of course.

707
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,240
We were when we were little.

708
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,440
We are now.

709
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,280
We will in the future.

710
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,300
Be careful.

711
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,680
It hurts.

712
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,520
What’s wrong?

713
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,520
I seemed to sprain my ankle.

714
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,800
Let me carry you on my back.

715
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,240
It’s okay. I’m very heavy.

716
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,400
Don’t worry. I won’t hurt you.

717
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,840
That’s not what I worry about.

718
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,040
Come on.

719
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,360
Are you tired?

720
00:31:59,240 --> 00:31:59,920
No.

721
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,560
You should put me down.

722
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,480
I can walk myself.

723
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:04,920
I said I’m not tired.

724
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,920
You don’t want to talk to me?

725
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,040
Why not?

726
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,680
Mom.

727
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,600
Why doesn’t Jiang Haoyue want
to talk to me?

728
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,080
He doesn’t know you well.

729
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,000
Would you talk to someone

730
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,960
who you don’t know passionately?

731
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,560
So.

732
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,400
Try to find out what he’s interested in.

733
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,760
I got it now.

734
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,000
You know nothing.

735
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,880
Silly girl.

736
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,880
Do you want to buy Haoyue a present?

737
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:08,700
<i>The Hardy Tin Soldier</i>

738
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,040
Mom, I want this.

739
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,600
Mom will come to see you soon.

740
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,840
My dear son, does it hurt?

741
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,360
It doesn’t hurt. I’m okay.

742
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,680
Then take good care of yourself.

743
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,000
I’ll go back to work now.

744
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,280
Well? Haoyue.

745
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,160
How do you feel today?

746
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,720
Let me read you a story.

747
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,800
Long long ago.

748
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,520
A man used a tin spoon

749
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,800
to cast 25 tiny tin soldiers.

750
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,080
When it come to the last one,
he ran out of tin.

751
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,880
So the tin soldier only has one leg.

752
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,880
Even so.

753
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,960
he still stands firmly with one leg

754
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,880
just as the other soldiers.

755
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,920
Miao.

756
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,040
Let Haoyue read it himself.

757
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,320
Come and help me.

758
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,040
Alright.

759
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,880
Smell if it’s good.

760
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,040
It’s surely cooked by father.

761
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,840
The sea sedge is cooked by you.

762
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,320
