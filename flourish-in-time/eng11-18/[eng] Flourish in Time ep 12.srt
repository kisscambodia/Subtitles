Guoguo,

33
00:02:00,237 --> 00:02:01,277
do you know your zodiac sign?

34
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,360
I do.

35
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,440
Leo.

36
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,200
What?

37
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,240
You’re a Leo?

38
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,360
I’m an Aries

39
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,320
Meng

40
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,120
is a Sagittarius.

41
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,000
The three of us are fire signs.

42
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,600
Since when did you
start studying horoscope?

43
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,240
This is what girls do.

44
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,040
This is knowledge,

45
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:15,880
which every man
or woman can learn.

46
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,680
What’s your purpose, then?

47
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,960
You study it so
you won’t fail in exams?

48
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,280
Sure. I’ve done fortune-telling.

49
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,960
Fortune favors me in February.

50
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,080
So I won’t fail in exams.

51
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,480
Why hasn’t she replied?

52
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,960
Did she read the
book on horoscope?

53
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,320
Pass me the ball.

54
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,640
Come on.

55
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,280
Ready.

56
00:02:39,612 --> 00:02:40,292
Nice.

57
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,680
Let me check the match
degree of me and Jiang.

<i>Sagittarius VS Scorpio 99%</i>

59
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,800
You need a miracle.

60
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,640
Your personalities,

61
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,800
the ways of thinking

62
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,280
and action are completely opposite.

63
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,720
These words

64
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,160
don’t sound like

65
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,160
a 99% match.

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,840
Is this a pirated book?

67
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,480
Why negative all of a sudden?

68
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,360
And the number is so large.

69
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,480
A perfect match?

70
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,920
Draw to each other like magnets?

71
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,240
-98%?

72
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,840
I’m sure it is a pirated book.

73
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,040
The pirated book is priced at 28?

74
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,480
It’s so easy to swindle Shi Che.

75
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,520
What...

76
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,000
what’s the matter with you?

77
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,840
Shi Che is so childish.

78
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,560
He gave me a book about horoscope

79
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,160
and scribbled on it.

80
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,360
How could he do this?

81
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,240
This is out of line.

82
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,360
Childish.

83
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,560
Come and sit at the table.

84
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,000
Dinner is about to be ready.

85
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,200
I tell you what,

86
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,200
I’m so addicted to

87
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:32,800
a novel recently...

88
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,600
The one I recommended to you?

89
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,040
Yeah.

90
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,520
Did you read the book?

91
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:36,920
Yeah.

92
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,240
What do you think?

93
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,880
I think you got swindled.

94
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,360
What?

95
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,600
That was a pirated book.

96
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,960
And it sells for 28 yuan?

97
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,160
Also, it’s so childish of you

98
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,720
to scribble on it.

99
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,800
Look.

100
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,360
Negative 98.

101
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,560
You know well

102
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,920
about your grades.

103
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,020
<i>Sagittarius VS Scorpio 99%</i>

104
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,480
Did you give the book to someone else

105
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,360
after I gave it to you?

106
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,680
Could it be Jiang Haoyue?

107
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,200
What are you talking about?

108
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,760
He wouldn’t do it.

109
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,680
He’s so dumb that

110
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,840
he’s talking gibberish.

111
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,240
Che,

112
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,320
at least you’ve learned the knowledge
about horoscope.

113
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,880
Don’t speak evil of him.

114
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,080
Right.

115
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,840
You!

116
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,000
Oh, Ziye,

117
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,120
what’s your zodiac sign?

118
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,600
Virgin.

119
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,680
Virgin?

120
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,280
I remember...

121
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,680
It’s true.

122
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,120
You and Che are a 100% match.

123
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,480
Look.

124
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,100
<i>Aries VS Virgin 100%</i>

125
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,880
This is a pirated book.

126
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,040
This is rubbish.

127
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,920
I wonder what Su Daifei’s is.

128
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,200
Su Daifei?

129
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,680
Why did you mention her?

130
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,440
Right, why would I?

131
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,560
Do you like her?

132
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,200
No, you...

133
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,240
Don’t slander me.

134
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,120
How can I like her?

135
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:14,960
Then why did you mention her?

136
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,360
I was thinking

137
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,040
she resembles my favorite idol.

138
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,920
Maybe she isn’t as bad as you think.

139
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,280
Right?

140
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,120
He’s questionable.

141
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,520
What is the meaning of this?

142
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,160
It means that you must curb yourself.

143
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,360
Since horoscope didn’t work,

144
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,760
I’ll have to confront him.

145
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,880
Sinister.

146
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,560
Sly.

147
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,720
Childish.

148
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,480
Did you change the figures in the book?

149
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,080
Yeah.

150
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,680
How about a fair and square competition?

151
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,080
Okay.

152
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,520
The teacher told me that

153
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,920
there will be a debate competition
this Saturday.

154
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,200
Anyone interested can

155
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,920
sign up for it.

156
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,000
I’m now going to write down

157
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,960
the statement of viewpoint

158
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,400
and group up a team
of the best debaters.

159
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,000
Are you interested?

160
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,120
No.

161
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,320
I figured.

162
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,200
You aren’t that eloquent anyway,
so let’s forget it.

163
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,640
What classes do we have
in the afternoon?

164
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,160
Chemistry, I think?

165
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,400
Excuse me.

166
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,040
There will be an event
at the comic bookstore this Saturday.

167
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,680
The prize is one of
the owner’s collections,

168
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,320
Naruto Manga collection
with Masashi Kishimoto’s signature on it.

169
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,840
Are you interested?

170
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,760
Signed by the author himself?

171
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,440
I must win it.

172
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,240
Right.

173
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,120
I know you the best.

174
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,520
Naruto is my favorite, too.

175
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,640
Listen,

176
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,480
I’ve got the best

177
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,960
costumes ready.

178
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,720
We’ll get the prize.

179
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,440
Sure.

180
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,400
Jiang, want to come along?

181
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,560
I’m not interested.

182
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,000
Why would you ask him?

183
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,360
He doesn’t read manga.

184
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,720
Plus, I’ve only prepared the costumes

185
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,240
for us two.

186
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,880
Can you tell me a little bit

187
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,080
about the costumes?

188
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:39,800
It’s a secret.

189
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,120
A secret.

190
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,000
I’ll go check the costumes.

191
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,520
Won’t you come along?

192
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,400
It’ll be fun.

193
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,720
Come on.

194
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,760
It’ll be awesome.

195
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,000
Not interested,

196
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,920
so no.

197
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,880
I don’t have time,

198
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,320
so no.

199
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,120
Doing exercises every day is so boring.

200
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,680
Qu Wei,

201
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,360
can I still sign up
for the debate competition?

202
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:11,960
What?

203
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,600
You changed your mind?

204
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,520
I want to do it.

205
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,340
<i>The 10th Nanfeng Senior High-schooler
Debate Competition</i>

206
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:46,220
<i>The 10th Nanfeng Senior High-schooler
Debate Competition Application Form</i>

207
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,260
<i>I’m Shi Che from Class 10, Grade 1</i>

208
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,740
<i>Email sent</i>

209
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,600
Darn it,

210
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,280
this is so cool.

211
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,840
What is this?

212
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,720
The present for Meng.

213
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,920
Huh?

214
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,560
Are you sure?

215
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,920
Will Miao be okay with playing a fish?

216
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,520
What fish!

217
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,400
She’ll be a mermaid.

218
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,200
Take a good look.

219
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:45,880
A mermaid?

220
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,080
This is the most crucial part

221
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,040
of my plan.

222
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,760
We’ll be bound together

223
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,560
by the arrow of Cupid.

224
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,640
All right, enough.

225
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,480
Come on, let’s rehearse.

226
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,480
Take it.

227
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,240
Get closer to me.

228
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,920
Get closer.

229
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,000
Closer.

230
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,120
Stab me with the arrow.

231
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,280
The event will be my stage.

232
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,080
At the event,

233
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,440
Lu Miao and I

234
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,440
will make the best memory.

235
00:11:45,134 --> 00:11:46,574
All right, you’re too heavy.

236
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,120
I can hardly breathe.

237
00:11:52,271 --> 00:11:53,471
Alright, come on.

238
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,640
Help me take off the costume.

239
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,680
I’m so hot.

240
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,920
I don’t know what I’m going to wear.

241
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,920
I don’t know what Shi Che is up to.

242
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,760
Ughh!

243
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,760
He said he’d make elaborate
preparations, didn’t he?

244
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,920
But I still don’t know

245
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,160
what I’m going to wear.

246
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,680
I wonder if he is dependable.

247
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,160
Are you free tomorrow?

248
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,520
I’ve signed for this debate competition.

249
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,640
I don’t know if I can be selected.

250
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,000
You can debate?

251
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,240
Yeah.

252
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,440
I’m ETC.

253
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,600
What ETC?

254
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,360
Beep.

255
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,680
A natural debater.

256
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,120
Meng,

257
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,560
would you like to know how we are

258
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,040
going to surprise everybody
at the event?

259
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,200
I tell you what,

260
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,520
I’m a bit grumpy at the moment.

261
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,360
Say what you want to say.

262
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,960
I said it’s a surprise.

263
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,320
We’ll go there together

264
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,600
and at the event,

265
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,480
you’ll know what it is.

266
00:12:52,084 --> 00:12:53,804
At the event?

267
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,120
Do you think you are

268
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,840
being funny right now?

269
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,760
Don’t worry.

270
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,760
Shi Che, Xie Ziye.

271
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,560
Follow me.

272
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,120
Congratulations, you two are selected

273
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,600
by the debate team of our school.

274
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,160
You’ll participate in the
municipal debate competition

275
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,640
tomorrow afternoon
on behalf of our school.

276
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:19,960
Him?

277
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:20,920
Me?

278
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,760
What?

279
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,080
What a surprise! Huh?

280
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,720
Is there a mistake?

281
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,360
I didn’t sign up for the debate.

282
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,680
Yeah, sir,

283
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,120
please check again.

284
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,960
Him? A debate competition?

285
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,480
Shi Che, don’t be a coward.

286
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,240
The professional debate instructor

287
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,640
found you.

288
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,520
Xie Ziye,

289
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,800
you’re the third debater.

290
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,400
Shi Che,

291
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,680
you’re the fourth.

292
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,720
You’ll be presenting the summary.

293
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Practice it well.

294
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,480
Wait,

295
00:13:46,565 --> 00:13:47,485
what’s happening?

296
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,480
Did you make a mistake?

297
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,440
I didn’t sign for a debate competition.

298
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,240
And I have something important to do

299
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,400
tomorrow afternoon.

300
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,800
What can be more important

301
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,400
than honoring our school?

302
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,840
Don’t try to chicken out.

303
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,720
Did you see how your
classmates looked at you?

304
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,400
I don’t care how you signed up,

305
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,560
since you’re selected,

306
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,356
you must go.

307
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,280
Practice hard.

308
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,360
Ridiculous.

309
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,520
Did you hear?

310
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,920
Unbelievable.

311
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,600
What’s wrong with him?

312
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,760
Why would he want to do this?

313
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:23,960
That’s it.

314
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,560
With Shi Che on the team.

315
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,480
we’ll definitely lose.

316
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,280
That’s it.

317
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,760
Without Shi Che,

318
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,480
I’ll lose.

319
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,740
<i>Class 1, Grade 2</i>

320
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,440
Have you heard that

321
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,680
Shi Che is on our

322
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,720
school debate team?

323
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,560
The thing is, the topic is

324
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,120
“Which is more important,
knowledge or ability?”

325
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,120
Shi Che chose

326
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,640
to be on the knowledge side.

327
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,000
Did you do it?

328
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,160
What?

329
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,760
Don’t act like you know nothing.

330
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,800
I went through the whole thing.

331
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,800
You asked for the link, right?

332
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,160
Did you do something to make

333
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,200
him selected into the debate team?

334
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,320
It seems I’m right.

335
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,720
Jiang Haoyue,

336
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,640
this is a master stratagem.

337
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,080
Since you’re so into inference,

338
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,480
why don’t you be a detective?

339
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,600
I kind of feel sorry for Shi Che.

340
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,680
I just can’t get over it.

341
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,240
Shi Che is such a jackass.

342
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,320
He promised to

343
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,480
help me win the signed manga.

344
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,440
Now he’s telling me he’s going to

345
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,160
this debate competition.

346
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,480
I believe in you.

347
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,480
You can do it on your own.

348
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,680
Right.

349
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,760
After all, that’s my stage.

350
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,040
I can help you

351
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,720
if you need.

352
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,200
Really?

353
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,160
You can’t get impatient, though.

354
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,920
I won’t.

355
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,280
You said you’d help me

356
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,040
research the costumes and roles.

357
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,320
Yet here you are, doing homework!

358
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,000
Let me finish my homework first.

359
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,560
Choose the costumes first.

360
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,520
Homework first.

361
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,800
Costumes first.

362
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,840
Homework first.

363
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,800
Cos...

364
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,200
Okay.

365
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,560
Well,

366
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,360
costumes first, then.

367
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,280
I knew it!

368
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,400
I’ve got several ideas.

369
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,280
Help me choose

370
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,960
the most original one.

371
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,000
This.

372
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,840
How about this?

373
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,960
Isn’t it original?

374
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,640
So short...

375
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,000
No.

376
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,880
It isn’t suitable for you.

377
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,720
Why?

378
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,840
You see,

379
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,520
the theme is originality and creativity.

380
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,840
This, obviously,

381
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,600
is to average.

382
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,200
True.

383
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,120
It feels like everybody would go

384
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,320
for this average anime style.

385
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,080
I’ll change another one.

386
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,160
This.

387
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,640
What about this?

388
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,320
It covers so little...

389
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:16,840
Is it special enough?

390
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,440
This is so odd.

391
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,800
I don’t think
many people would understand it.

392
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,400
Really?

393
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,440
I think it’s good.

394
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,240
You know nothing.

395
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,200
How about you try that one.

396
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,000
The last one.

397
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,480
This one?

398
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,840
This one...

399
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,720
Seems too conservative.

400
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,080
I think it’s quite nice.

401
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,240
And you can

402
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,440
cos-play a hit woman

403
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,720
of a mysterious organization in this.

404
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,280
You know, those who

405
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,880
use a piece of paper as an edgy knife.

406
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,560
A paper knife?

407
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,800
Good.

408
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,080
This one, then.

409
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,280
Che,

410
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,200
you’re wearing the costume.

411
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,840
I won’t have enough time. Quickly.

412
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,720
Can you ride a bike dressing like this?

413
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,160
I’ll be careful.

414
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,200
Thanks to you,

415
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,000
my bro.

416
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,160
My dad

417
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,600
naively wanted to stop me?

418
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,160
No way.

419
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,480
Uh, I suggest you think twice.

420
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,720
If the principal finds out,

421
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,440
not just you,

422
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,080
I’d also be...

423
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,640
Where are you going?

424
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,880
Dad, I’m in a rush.

425
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,640
I know you’re going to the
debate competition,

426
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,960
and you’re running out of time.

427
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,480
I’ll drive you there.

428
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,560
Come on, get in.

429
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,360
Bye-bye.

430
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,550
<i>Time Book</i>

431
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,160
Everybody has given their best.

432
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,160
Why are you here?

433
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,040
I’m here to accompany you.

434
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,920
But yesterday, you said you

435
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,000
got stuff to do.

436
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,200
That was yesterday.

437
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,520
I changed my plan.

438
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,400
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

439
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,120
Come on, follow me.

440
00:20:29,553 --> 00:20:31,073
Your clothes...

441
00:20:32,053 --> 00:20:33,213
I’m not a participant.

442
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,545
It’s an anime-themed event.

443
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,360
You should at least have some sort
of anime element on you

444
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,120
or you can’t go in.

445
00:20:40,812 --> 00:20:41,572
Well,

446
00:20:41,928 --> 00:20:42,968
I’ll wait for you at the door.

447
00:20:43,062 --> 00:20:45,302
No, you’re here already.

448
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,600
We’re open.

449
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,200
Wait a second.

450
00:20:48,534 --> 00:20:49,294
Mr. Hao,

451
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,720
is there a way to

452
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,720
let him in?

453
00:20:53,265 --> 00:20:54,585
There are some props in my storage room.

454
00:20:54,943 --> 00:20:55,823
How about

455
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,800
you go and have a look?

456
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:57,560
Sure.

457
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,120
Thank you, Mr. Hao.

458
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:05,600
Quickly.

459
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,600
Dad!

460
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,040
At least let me change my clothes.

461
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,000
No time for it.

462
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,440
Make haste!

463
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,600
Get the arrow off you

464
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,200
right now.

465
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,680
This is very expensive.

466
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,920
And I spent a lot of time on it.

467
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,720
If you don’t,

468
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,920
I’ll rip your head off.

469
00:21:21,287 --> 00:21:21,927
I will!

470
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,480
It’s me.

471
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,480
What a jester!

472
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,200
Morning, Principal.

473
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:32,880
Quickly.

474
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,160
Over there.

475
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,200
Look at his funny outfit.

476
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,200
He’s a weirdo.

477
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,320
Young man, you’re
sitting on the wrong side.

478
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,160
I chose ability.

479
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,280
Shi Che,

480
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,680
in the application form,

481
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,400
your statement says

482
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,080
you’re on the knowledge side.

483
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,440
My application form?

484
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,200
Yes, Shi Che.

485
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,000
Please find your own seat.

486
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,840
He’s so funny.

487
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,240
Is he a student from your school?

488
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,960
Good, Mr. Shi.

489
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,640
He’s pretty unique.

490
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,240
Who did this to me?

491
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,200
Was it you?

492
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,240
The competition begins.

493
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,480
The first debater
on the proposition side can start.

494
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,640
How do I

495
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,040
dress you up?

496
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,920
Make it simple.

497
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,800
But originality is also important.

498
00:22:49,862 --> 00:22:50,582
I got it.

499
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,120
Do you need help?

500
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,880
No, I’m good.

501
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,000
Opposite direction.

502
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,680
Confucius traveled around states,

503
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,440
perfected his philosophies
through practice.

504
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,760
He dedicated his whole life to

505
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,080
embedding knowledge
in governing the state.

506
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,240
Zhan Tianyou pioneered

507
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,240
shaft excavation and

508
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,520
herringbone railway through practice.

509
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,760
Yuan Longping plowed farmlands,

510
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,440
had no fear for loneliness.
Having respect for practice,

511
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,880
he developed hybrid rice

512
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,120
and benefited mankind.

513
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,760
The knowledge of these sages

514
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,800
affects the world profoundly.

515
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,600
And all the knowledge

516
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,200
is the summary of their abilities.

517
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,120
When you are asked later,

518
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,080
stick to your argument,

519
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,160
don’t be led astray.

520
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,920
Don’t move,

521
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,080
I’ll draw your model number.

522
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,720
Don’t move.

523
00:24:59,120 --> 00:24:59,880
Raise your arms.

524
00:25:23,281 --> 00:25:24,041
Your hand.

525
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,200
Go,

526
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:38,920
T800.

527
00:25:39,946 --> 00:25:41,106
In conclusion,

528
00:25:41,228 --> 00:25:42,908
<i>Debate Competition</i>
the knowledge that you learn in school

529
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:45,508
is only useful in social practice.

530
00:25:45,565 --> 00:25:47,405
Therefore, we firmly believe that

531
00:25:47,405 --> 00:25:49,765
ability is more important
than knowledge.

532
00:25:51,018 --> 00:25:51,698
We’ll try to defend.

533
00:25:51,698 --> 00:25:52,628
If not, we attack.

534
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:53,840
Chlorophyll.

535
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:54,530
What?

536
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:55,642
Help me out here.

537
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,680
Finish it off.

538
00:25:58,209 --> 00:25:59,129
What’s your opinion?

539
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,920
Are there any attack points?

540
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,800
Attack?

541
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,920
Attack what?

542
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,880
What a waste of time!

543
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,640
She makes perfect sense.

544
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,570
It isn’t a sports competition.

545
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,810
Why do you care so much?

546
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:09,610
Don’t mind him.

547
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,520
Let’s discuss.

548
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:17,989
Here.

549
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:18,970
What?

550
00:26:19,212 --> 00:26:21,012
You’ll be making the summary.

551
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,280
Just read it out.

552
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,720
Okay. The fourth debater
of the proposition side,

553
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,280
please give your summary.

554
00:26:36,256 --> 00:26:36,976
Friends of this debate,

555
00:26:37,706 --> 00:26:39,146
why do we waste time?

556
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:41,131
Time is priceless.

557
00:26:41,515 --> 00:26:42,755
Why do we talk so much

558
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,280
until this hour?

559
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,840
Why laughing at me?

560
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:48,920
It is you who kept

561
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,400
babbling about the school, right?

562
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,360
I don’t get it.

563
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,440
Do you think

564
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,400
all you can learn
in school is knowledge?

565
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:55,441
I’ll be honest with you,

566
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,760
My grades are poor,

567
00:26:56,928 --> 00:26:58,448
I don’t really like studying.

568
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,000
I hate examinations the most.

569
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,920
But is all knowledge from the textbooks?

570
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,000
Absolutely not.

571
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,840
I don’t skip class anymore

572
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,240
and start to learn how to get along
with teachers and classmates,

573
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,600
and how to adapt to the collective life

574
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,480
because I’ve learned not

575
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,560
to escape,

576
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,360
and try to do what others cannot do.

577
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,280
From not doing my homework

578
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,480
to trying to turn in homework timely,

579
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,240
I’ve learned the importance of

580
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,840
execution and responsibility.

581
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,800
I joined the school team

582
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,080
because since little,

583
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,680
I knew that
the honor of the collective comes first.

584
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,480
This is the knowledge that I learned

585
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,120
from school,

586
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,480
and with the knowledge,

587
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,000
I give full play to my abilities.

588
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,280
What’s the point in this lengthy debate?

589
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,200
Sorry.

590
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,600
Passing through.

591
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,440
Let’s welcome T800.

592
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,520
This is original.

593
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,720
This is so cool.

594
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,840
So amazing.

595
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,400
So cool.

596
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,240
The exciting moment has come.

597
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,000
The best cos-player is...

598
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,080
Who do you think it is?

599
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,080
It should be him.

600
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,800
I want the signed manga so much.

601
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,800
T800!

602
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,160
Applause!

603
00:29:11,821 --> 00:29:12,821
Let’s go.

604
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,400
We won!

605
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,280
This is your stage.

606
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,160
Thanks.

607
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,240
Come on.

608
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,080
Look at me.

609
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,520
I’m so happy.

610
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,800
It was fun.

611
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,480
And you’re talented in art.

612
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,440
I told you that

613
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,160
other than study,

614
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,720
I’m good at many stuff.

615
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:58,382
Shi Che?

616
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,600
Why are you wearing this?

617
00:30:02,021 --> 00:30:03,261
I thought you went to the debate.

618
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,640
And you are the best debater.

619
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,331
Thanks to you!

620
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,840
Way to go.

621
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,920
I didn’t expect you to

622
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,880
have talent for debate.

623
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,280
Let me check the medal.

624
00:30:13,218 --> 00:30:14,298
A debate?

625
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,440
Well, it was easy.

626
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,600
They were no match for me.

627
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,120
Look,

628
00:30:18,446 --> 00:30:20,046
Jiang Haoyue won the best cos-player.

629
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,960
So we got the

630
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,000
signed manga.

631
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,880
What?

632
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,280
This ugly cos-play?

633
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,800
Were the judges blind?

634
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,640
I designed this.

635
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,400
A worthy winner!

636
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,000
An undoubtedly worthy winner!

637
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,440
Your costume, however,

638
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,640
is not that good.

639
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,840
You need two extra snake heads

640
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,680
to up your game.

641
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,920
Let’s go home.

642
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,160
We’re off, Shi Che. Bye-bye.

643
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,900
<i>Best Cos-player</i>

644
00:31:29,353 --> 00:31:31,233
It’s always been you who taught me,

645
00:31:31,475 --> 00:31:32,355
today, you came

646
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,480
and learned more about my hobby.

647
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,960
I’m really happy.

648
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,680
Your hobby itself is fun.

649
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,840
Since we were little,

650
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,160
you’ve always been the model.

651
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,960
You’re perfect in everything.

652
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,800
Although we live together,

653
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,280
the more we grow,

654
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,520
the less I know you.

655
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,560
I feel like we’re
distancing from one another.

656
00:32:03,703 --> 00:32:04,703
Are we?

657
00:32:14,096 --> 00:32:15,736
It’s not too late.

658
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,640
How about we take a walk?

659
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,240
The sea breeze makes me so comfortable.

660
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,840
It’s kind of chilly, though.

661
00:32:40,696 --> 00:32:42,216
Put on my shirt.

662
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,280
Let me show you a picture.

663
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,720
This is the

664
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,280
all-sky image

665
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,800
taken by ESA’s

666
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,240
Planck telescope

667
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,560
on July 5, 2010.

668
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,200
It was synthesized with

669
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,000
120 images.

670
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:07,640
Look.

671
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,200
The oval

672
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,240
is the galaxy.

673
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,360
The net-like structure

674
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,240
is a system formed by the stars.

675
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,960
The growth of a star

676
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,880
promotes the development
of the entire system.

677
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,680
Like our solar system.

678
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,080
First, the sun,

679
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,160
then the earth,

680
00:33:28,612 --> 00:33:29,972
the moon

681
00:33:30,171 --> 00:33:33,051
and all the other planets.

682
00:33:36,193 --> 00:33:37,353
So

683
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,560
a star is like

684
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,720
an ever-growing child.

685
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,080
It’s like...

686
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,160
As I grow up,

687
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,680
I have more and more friends.

688
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,240
You can say it that way.

689
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,800
But if you’re a star,

690
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,080
then...

691
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,000
You’re the moon.

692
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,160
The moon?

693
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:03,880
Yes.

694
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,760
Although you look icy,

695
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,200
you’re always the most shining thing

696
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,440
in the night sky.

697
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,480
Yes.

698
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,040
The moon is shiny

699
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,800
but it only reflects the sunlight.

700
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,240
I didn’t know you’re into this.

701
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,360
Don’t you think that

702
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,040
when you look up into the starry sky,

703
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,480
all your trouble goes away?

704
00:34:46,975 --> 00:34:48,815
Do you have a lot of trouble?

705
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,880
We could see

706
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,000
the quadrantids meteor shower tonight,

707
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,200
but not in this weather,

708
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,200
I’m afraid.

709
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,480
Look, here it comes.

710
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:23,679
It’s so beautiful.

711
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:45,280
Miss!

712
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,160
You missed it!

713
00:35:47,818 --> 00:35:49,278
Missed!

714
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:54,920
Miss!

715
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,040
Miss!

716
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,120
Lu Miao, you’re disappointing.

717
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,280
You hang out with a cripple every day,

718
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,040
so you can’t control your hands.

719
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,840
Shut up! You wait and see!

720
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,920
I’ll hit it!

721
00:36:15,944 --> 00:36:25,944
