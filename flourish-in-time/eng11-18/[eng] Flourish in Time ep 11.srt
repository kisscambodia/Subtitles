Jiang Haoyue.

32
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,000
I’m so jealous.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,920
When can I get snacks, too?

34
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,240
Here you go.

35
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,640
I don’t want yours.

36
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,880
Maybe from some

37
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,480
adorable junior girls.

38
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,200
For me?

39
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,560
Please

40
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,280
take good care of Haoyue!

41
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,560
Am I your attendant?

42
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,200
Haoyue,

43
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,480
please take good care of yourself.

44
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,040
I’ll just have to throw them away.

45
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,520
Why?

46
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,640
Someone may get upset about it.

47
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,800
Who knows who that is?

48
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,440
What are you so excited about?

49
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,240
After the New Year’s Eve Party,

50
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,240
I’ve been getting more and more popular.

51
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,040
Really?

52
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,120
Congratulations.

53
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,120
I received a love letter today!

54
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,440
Who’s it from?

55
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,840
Some guy from the next class.

56
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,560
But don’t worry,

57
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,760
since we’ve signed the
No-Relationship-In-Highschool Contract,

58
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,720
I won’t respond to the letter.

59
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,320
Don’t read it.

60
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,960
It’s embarrassing.

61
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,240
What does it say?

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,560
Is it touchy-feely?

63
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,800
Dear Lu Miao...

64
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,000
Stop.

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,600
Stop reading.

66
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,360
It’s embarrassing for me.

67
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,560
I can get shy sometimes.

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,560
Dear Lu Miao,

69
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,400
at the New Year’s Eve Party,

70
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,800
I saw your back flip

71
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,440
and split on the stage.

72
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,200
I admire you so much.

73
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,080
My dream of childhood was

74
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,000
to become an outstanding acrobat.

75
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,280
I wonder

76
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,200
if I’m honored enough

77
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,000
to be your apprentice.

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,960
Hopefully you can help me
to realize my dream.

79
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,560
Sincerely yours.

80
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,920
What a genuine letter.

81
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,640
I think you should say yes.

82
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,600
Stop kidding.

83
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,880
How come Su Daifei hasn’t
come to you that often lately?

84
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,880
We haven’t been in touch
since the party.

85
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,800
We weren’t close anyway.

86
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,160
Not only Su Daifei,

87
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,320
there are less girls sending you gifts.

88
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,400
That’s odd.

89
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,200
Even I’ve become more popular,

90
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,840
how come you’re going backwards?

91
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,280
Unlike someone,
I don’t accept other’s love letter

92
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,840
after signing the contract.

93
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,640
This is not a love letter.

94
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,760
It’s a letter asking me
to be his teacher.

95
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,920
Then who was it that bragged

96
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,320
about receiving a love letter?

97
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,800
It’s my first time receiving
this kind of thing.

98
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,520
Can’t I just be excited?

99
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,120
Plus,

100
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,440
signing the contract means

101
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,200
that I won’t be in a relationship
with anybody.

102
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,720
What?

103
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,320
Really?

104
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
I do have

105
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,400
the spirit of contract, okay?

106
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,600
I hope so.

107
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,280
How dare you force Meng
to sign the stupid contract!

108
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,400
What’s the matter?

109
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,680
Do we have a problem?

110
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,840
Kind of.

111
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,960
If so, just tell me.

112
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,920
Can you stop getting in the way
of me and her?

113
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,240
Are you sure

114
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,000
that I’m getting in your way?

115
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,640
Isn’t that the case?

116
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,520
Since I know Lu Miao,

117
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,720
you’ve been placing obstacles for us.

118
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,480
From the Drum Battle,

119
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,000
to bike riding,

120
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,960
and then to the New Year’s Eve Party.

121
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,920
As a senior student,

122
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,960
why do you always pick on me?

123
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,840
Do you...

124
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,000
like Lu Miao as well?

125
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,080
I’m her brother.

126
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,160
You’re not blood-related.

127
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,520
Even if you are her brother,

128
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,760
don’t try to make everything
your own business.

129
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,400
Why did you sigh?

130
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,040
I didn’t expect Su Daifei to be the one

131
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,560
who ruined our performance.

132
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,880
My fantasy about her has been ruined.

133
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,120
That’s right.

134
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,920
Guoguo, how can I

135
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,120
be depressed about

136
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,400
meeting a strong opponent?

137
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,160
That doesn’t sound like what I mean.

138
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,720
When I asked Jiang Haoyue

139
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,360
if he liked Lu Miao,

140
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,440
I found his face expression weird.

141
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,920
I think,

142
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,200
Jiang Haoyue must have
some feelings for her.

143
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,520
But probably he haven’t
thought it through.

144
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,320
Since he’s not clear about it,

145
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,960
I should seize the chance

146
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,760
to stop it from happening.

147
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,840
Che, did you listen

148
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,400
to me carefully at all?

149
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,440
I have to go back and make a plan.

150
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,800
Thank you for your advice.

151
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,840
I’m paying again.

152
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:02,748
How much is it over there?

153
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,000
78 yuan.

154
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,640
One cup of milky green tea.

155
00:07:12,868 --> 00:07:14,702
I can’t be fooled
by her appearance anymore.

156
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:15,142
Wait, no.

157
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,360
Extra sugar. Extra pearls,

158
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:16,840
coconut jelly,

159
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,080
mashed taro and puddings.

160
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,960
These many ingredients
can make you full.

161
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,080
Why do you care?

162
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,920
She’s indeed an evil woman.

163
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,760
I want a cup of milky green tea,

164
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,200
without milk.

165
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,120
What’s with all this trouble?

166
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,200
Why don’t you just order
a cup of green tea?

167
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Alright, I’ll just have
a cup of green tea.

168
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,640
Okay.

169
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,200
Here’s your tea.

170
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,880
Thank you.

171
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,080
Excuse me.

172
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,720
Sorry.

173
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,040
Aren’t you afraid of getting cut?

174
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,680
Hello, can I have two bowls
of porridge, please?

175
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,280
We only have the last bowl.

176
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,000
It’s alright.

177
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,840
We can share it using two spoons.

178
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,360
Sure.

179
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,440
What a coincidence, Meng.

180
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,320
Morning, Miao.

181
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,040
Morning.

182
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,320
Morning, Scholar-tyrant.

183
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,440
You are having porridge.

184
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,360
I’ll have the same.

185
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,000
The staff said that it’s

186
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,560
the last bowl here.

187
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,480
Why don’t you have something else?

188
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,440
I don’t want soybean milk
and fried bread stick.

189
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,480
How about...

190
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,640
I share the porridge with my brother.

191
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,880
You share it?

192
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,840
What’s wrong?

193
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,920
This is the last bowl.

194
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,240
Meng,

195
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,720
you need to be clear

196
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,880
that you are siblings.

197
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,280
Your spoons stirring
in the porridge together

198
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,280
is inappropriate.

199
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,280
I’m thinking for your sake.

200
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,240
The school’s been very strict
with students having a relationship.

201
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,040
What if other students see you two?

202
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,280
It’s easy for those
who don’t know the situation

203
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,920
to misunderstand.

204
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,240
Meng doesn’t know it.

205
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,600
Haoyue,

206
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,720
as the elder brother,

207
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,480
you should know it, right?

208
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,680
It’s fine.

209
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,800
I’ll get another bowl

210
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,840
so we can split it.

211
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,160
You talk too much.

212
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,440
I didn’t quite understand

213
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,400
the geometry part in the class.

214
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,800
Can you help me? This question.

215
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,520
This one?

216
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,640
I’m cold.

217
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,360
It feels so warm here.

218
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,200
Meng, you are asking your brother
questions again?

219
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,320
Yeah, why are you here?

220
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,920
It’s getting cold.

221
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,000
I can only get warm by exercising.

222
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,880
I don’t have a brother.

223
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,040
The break is too short.

224
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,000
I’ll help you after we go back home.

225
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,560
Sure.

226
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,320
What’s wrong?

227
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,520
Why do you always focus
on me and my brother?

228
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,240
You two are so obvious out here.

229
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,200
Why didn’t you mention it before?

230
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,680
I didn’t notice his hidden intention
back then.

231
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,040
What?

232
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,680
Anyway,

233
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,480
you two should be more careful.

234
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,280
What’s up?

235
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,400
Shi Che

236
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,360
has been following me and my brother.

237
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,560
It’s so annoying.

238
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,520
He said something
about hidden attention.

239
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,560
Isn’t it annoying?

240
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,840
Hidden attention?

241
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,880
Lu Miao, you mean hidden intention?

242
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,600
Yeah.

243
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,200
But that’s not the point.

244
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,720
The point is

245
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,360
I don’t know why he’s
always following us.

246
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,720
He makes it look like we’ve done

247
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,840
something wrong.

248
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,480
Well,

249
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,280
since Shi Che thinks your
brother has hidden intention,

250
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,400
does that mean...

251
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,520
Lu Miao,

252
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,360
do you feel that lately your brother

253
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,240
doesn’t want to be your brother anymore?

254
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,200
That’s not for us to decide.

255
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,280
Since the first day
he showed up in my home,

256
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,760
he’s been my brother.

257
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,560
However,

258
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,040
Jiang Haoyue has been disapproving

259
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,320
of me to call him brother.

260
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,200
Why?

261
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,400
My ranking went down in the recent exam.

262
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,040
Do you think he’s shamed of my

263
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,160
terrible studying?

264
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,080
That must be it.

265
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,520
Well, I have to study harder.

266
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,880
You do have a strange logic.

267
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,280
Have you ever thought

268
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,200
that the reason
why Jiang Haoyue is like this,

269
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,240
is because he has feelings for you?

270
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,520
What?

271
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,480
That’s impossible.

272
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,720
We both signed the
No-Relationship-In-Highschool Contract.

273
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,680
A simple-minded girl like you

274
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,000
will never understand
Jiang Haoyue’s care and thought.

275
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,640
It’s true that
I don’t know him very well,

276
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,240
especially as we’re growing
older and older.

277
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,200
It’s just a random thought.

278
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,480
Don’t be so serious.

279
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,160
It makes me feel like I misspoke.

280
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,240
No, you didn’t.

281
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,440
It’s just what you said is true.

282
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,400
Though I grew up with Jiang Haoyue,

283
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,680
he always lives in his own world.

284
00:13:20,246 --> 00:13:21,846
A world

285
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,560
which he never tells me about.

286
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,360
I don’t know it at all.

287
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,520
Actually, everybody has its own space.

288
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,000
Plus, there are a lot of times

289
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,680
that we don’t even see
through ourselves,

290
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,880
let alone others.

291
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,400
Alright, let’s go.

292
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,800
What are you thinking about?

293
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,480
I’m working on this question.

294
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,600
Come on.

295
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,280
You’ve done it many times.

296
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,000
Tell me,

297
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,520
what’s bothering you so much?

298
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,680
How should a brother

299
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,600
treat his sister?

300
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,040
There’s no gender difference

301
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,040
between brothers and sisters, I guess.

302
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,000
Well,

303
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,160
what is it like when you fall
for someone?

304
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,040
You’d want to kiss her.

305
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,720
What? You disagree?

306
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,040
There’s another solution
to that question.

307
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,920
Try to work it out.

308
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,020
<i>Time Book</i>

309
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,521
Jiang Haoyue made a cunning move

310
00:14:57,043 --> 00:14:58,283
of secretly signing the

311
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,160
No-Relationship-In-Highschool Contract
with Meng.

312
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,480
It stops Meng from sensing my charm.

313
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,240
Che,

314
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,400
excuse me for being honest,

315
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,440
you’re basically helpless.

316
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,160
Guoguo,

317
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,560
don’t ever say unlucky words
like this anymore.

318
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,560
No, that’s not what I mean.

319
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,600
I mean,

320
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,360
what’s your next plan?

321
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,520
It can only be

322
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,440
using the advantage of the internet.

323
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,440
What do you mean?

324
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,720
I have a friend,

325
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,400
the girl he likes signed the
No-Relationship-In-Highschool Contract

326
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,000
with another guy.

327
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,960
What kind of situation is that?

328
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,720
Is the so-called “friend”
actually yourself?

329
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,560
What a pity.

330
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,240
The net friends are pretty good at this.

331
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,920
Say what you want, don’t be ambiguous.

332
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,320
What the contract really means is

333
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,960
they’ll be in a relationship
once they graduate.

334
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,200
This is a declaration of their love,
stupid!

335
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,120
However, there are ways to solve this.

336
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,400
What do you mean?

337
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,320
To see it from another angle,

338
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,760
she cannot date with anyone,

339
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,520
not only you.

340
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,480
If you don’t have a chance,

341
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,760
it’s the same for others.

342
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,720
This is a unique angle.

343
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:19,920
Yeah.

344
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,960
Please tell me more.

345
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,400
Find something that she’s interested in

346
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,560
and you’re good at

347
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,480
to leave her a favorable impression.

348
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,600
Let her see a different version of you.

349
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
But remember, in this contract,

350
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,240
time means possibility.

351
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:38,800
Good luck.

352
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,600
The thing which Meng’s interested in

353
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,840
and I’m also good at?

354
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,000
I got it.

355
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:02,800
Meng,

356
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,840
there is a new batch
of comic books in the store.

357
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,400
Do you want to go and check together?

358
00:17:08,984 --> 00:17:10,504
I’ll skip that.

359
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,200
I promised my brother to study together.

360
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,240
Aren’t you tried of going back home

361
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,280
with him every day?

362
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,480
Occasionally reading comic books

363
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,800
won’t hold you from studying.

364
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,080
Let’s go.

365
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,040
The bookstore isn’t disappearing.

366
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,680
I’ll go with you next time.

367
00:17:24,296 --> 00:17:25,296
When’s the next time?

368
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,520
We’ll see. Bye.

369
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,920
“Luxuriant reeds growing by the river,

370
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,440
the dew of the morning
hasn’t dried out.”

371
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,760
Is there anything wrong
with this sentence?

372
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:49,949
What happened to you?

373
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,520
I...

374
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,840
got distracted.

375
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,880
I want to have a popsicle.

376
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,680
Eat slowly.

377
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,360
It’s too cold. It may harm your stomach.

378
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,160
Don’t worry, I’ll enjoy it slowly.

379
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,560
What’s the matter?

380
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:24,760
What?

381
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,280
The popsicle got stuck on my lip.

382
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,760
Don’t panic. Don’t drag it.

383
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,440
It may break your lip.

384
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,600
Then what should I do?

385
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,000
Don’t move.

386
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,640
What are you doing?

387
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,000
The warm breath

388
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,440
can help accelerate
the popsicle’s melting.

389
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,040
What is it like when you fall
for someone?

390
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,480
You’d want to kiss her.

391
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,880
What’s wrong?

392
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,720
Don’t move.

393
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,480
What’s wrong?

394
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,800
Well,

395
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,680
the weather is too hot.

396
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,840
Do you want this?

397
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,600
Here.

398
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,080
What?

399
00:19:44,953 --> 00:19:45,613
No.

400
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,800
Mr. Jiang...

401
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,120
Girls can’t eat too much cold food.

402
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,000
It’s just a small bite.

403
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,320
Save me the last bite, please.

404
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,040
You didn’t save me anything,

405
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,160
and it dropped on the ground.

406
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,120
Girls can’t eat cold food.

407
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,080
Whatever.

408
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,520
Mom.

409
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,600
Mom.

410
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,320
I’m so tired.

411
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,000
What are you doing?

412
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,880
Why are you here?

413
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,800
You look so happy.

414
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,480
I came out after finishing

415
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,360
my homework.

416
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,680
I wasn’t playing all the time.

417
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:21,800
Let me buy you some snacks.

418
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,160
How about popsicles?

419
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,120
I happen to need something
to cheer me up.

420
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,320
Mom.

421
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:27,960
That’s okay.

422
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,120
Did you do anything bad?

423
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:29,760
No.

424
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,000
Then why don’t you want the popsicle?

425
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I’m fine, really.

426
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,560
Congcong,

427
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,200
what should I do

428
00:20:57,809 --> 00:20:59,449
when falling for someone?

429
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,520
Che, you need to relax to score.

430
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,880
Do you have anything on your mind?

431
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,640
My plan failed.

432
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,080
What plan?

433
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,200
At first, after my repeated emphasis,

434
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,040
Jiang Haoyue did start to care about
my relationship with Lu Miao.

435
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,520
However, my actions seemed
to have annoyed her.

436
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,640
She even started to hate me.

437
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
Maybe you acted too strongly.

438
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,960
It’s understandable.

439
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,640
Why not change a plan?

440
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,160
You’re right.

441
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,120
I can change my plan.

442
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,320
My opponent is too cunning.

443
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,520
How come I feel

444
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,200
that you’re the only one
who’s taking actions?

445
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,320
I’ve thought it through.

446
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,680
Since Jiang Haoyue won’t let
Lu Miao go to the bookstore,

447
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,240
I can borrow the comic books

448
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,400
and give them to her instead.

449
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,800
There’s no way for Jiang Haoyue

450
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,760
to know better than me
about comic books.

451
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,440
Good idea.

452
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,960
Let’s go to the bookstore now.

453
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,000
Play basketball first.

454
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,760
I won’t stop my dream

455
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,800
because of romance.

456
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,680
I’m very confident about it.

457
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,800
You are very wise.

458
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:19,960
Do you want

459
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,560
to take a look of the bookstore?

460
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,800
What did you say?

461
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,880
I said we’ve arrived at the bookstore,

462
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,760
do you want to go in there?

463
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,320
I heard new comic books have arrived.

464
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:32,000
I got it, you’re testing me.

465
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,400
I won’t fall for it.

466
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,080
What’s in your mind exactly?

467
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,360
I think you should combine exertion
and rest.

468
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,720
It’s fine if you don’t want to go.

469
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,840
It’s my fault. I was being suspicious.

470
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,840
I’d really love to read the comics.

471
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,800
Let’s go.

472
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,360
I’m going to read it now.

473
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,520
Are you going to do exercises here

474
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,840
or...?

475
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,440
I...

476
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,560
I’ll read with you.

477
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,760
Really?

478
00:23:13,731 --> 00:23:14,771
I’ll choose for you.

479
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:17,600
This one!

480
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:19,955
This one suits straight-A students.

481
00:23:20,046 --> 00:23:20,686
And

482
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,840
this one.

483
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,560
Its main character is very handsome,

484
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,160
just like you.

485
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,960
And,

486
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,080
this one,

487
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,880
it’s very exciting.

488
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,920
You’ll surely like it.

489
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,760
So which one should I start with?

490
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,800
Whichever you want.

491
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,920
Let’s read together.

492
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,960
I’ll start with this one.

493
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,680
Is it good?

494
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,560
Yeah, it’s good.

495
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,680
Isn’t this guy cool?

496
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,160
This one?

497
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,920
It’s so late.

498
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,760
What should I say to my parents?

499
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,400
Don’t worry.

500
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,280
I’ve messaged your parents,

501
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,920
saying that we studied outside tonight.

502
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,320
That’s my brother!

503
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,400
You’re very considerate.

504
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,280
Stop calling me brother.

505
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:40,800
Why?

506
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,240
Is it because

507
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,120
you think

508
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,040
I’m a shame?

509
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,080
No.

510
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,000
This appellation is limited.

511
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,800
We’re more than that.

512
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,480
We’re also schoolmates,

513
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,320
friends and neighbors.

514
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,680
Anyway, just don’t call me that anymore.

515
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,800
Then

516
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,960
can I call you

517
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,080
Haohao?

518
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,720
Just Jiang would be fine.

519
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,520
Haohao!

520
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:25,920
Whatever you want.

521
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,440
How about I call you Mr. Jiang?

522
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,000
Well, Mr. Jiang,

523
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,200
I’m really cold now.

524
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,280
Can we hurry to go back home?

525
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,560
You’re cold?

526
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,040
Let’s go.

527
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,260
<i>Open</i>

528
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,280
Mr. Hao,

529
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,280
did you just say Lu Miao
and Jiang Haoyue

530
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,200
stayed here late

531
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,200
to read comic books?

532
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,200
Yeah.

533
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,560
Are you sure it was Jiang Haoyue?

534
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,360
That’s impossible.

535
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,080
Jiang Haoyue wouldn’t come here.

536
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,120
Plus, you don’t know him.

537
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,160
Mr. Hao,

538
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,360
you’re lying.

539
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,960
Here, see for yourself.

540
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,400
Jiang Haoyue...

541
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,720
Shi Che, cheer up.

542
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,040
You won’t lose.

543
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,200
Negative Score, what are you doing here?

544
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,840
Chlorophyll?

545
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,080
What books are you reading here?

546
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,000
Why do you care?

547
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,040
There’s a bug.

548
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,800
Where?

549
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,960
Miss Astrology?

550
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,480
With the Academy of Astrology
as the background,

551
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,960
start the love stories
between Miss Astrology

552
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,240
and twelve charming boys
in their time of youth.

553
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,840
You don’t say.

554
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,600
Some people look pretty serious

555
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,400
but secretly read
romantic novels like this.

556
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,920
I didn’t know you were so hypocritical.

557
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:05,720
What?

558
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,280
You don’t want others to know?

559
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,560
Just say,

560
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,360
“Shi Che is the most handsome
in the universe.”

561
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,392
Then I’ll keep the secret for you.

562
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,440
I’ve never seen anyone as cheeky as you.

563
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,640
Our Study Representative Xie Ziye
loves romantic novels.

564
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,320
Shi Che is the most handsome
in the universe!

565
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,600
Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone.

566
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,640
Anyway,

567
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,480
“twelve charming boys”,

568
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,360
isn’t it too much for you?

569
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,400
What do you know?

570
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,440
They represent twelve constellations.

571
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,920
It’s related to astrology,

572
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,800
not just some romantic novel.

573
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,440
What’s...

574
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,800
What’s astrology?

575
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,120
It’s analyzing constellations!

576
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,000
It can not only help you
to better understand yourself,

577
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,840
but also help you to know others better.

578
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,760
It can also tell if you match
with other people.

579
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,360
Isn’t it like fortune-telling?

580
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,760
It’s a science of probability
and psychology.

581
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,600
Then, it’s fortune-telling.

582
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,480
Thank you.

583
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,240
It’s for you.

584
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,400
The Most Accurate Constellation
Matching Guide?

585
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,560
Can I refuse to take it?

586
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,280
No.

587
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,120
This is the winter-vacation gift,
the terminal gift,

588
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,400
the Spring Festival gift as well as

589
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,640
the New Year’s Day gift
which was chosen carefully by me.

590
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,120
Sorry for the things earlier.

591
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,600
See it as a compensation.

592
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,160
Chosen carefully for me?

593
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,120
How come I think it’s a book

594
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,280
you finished but

595
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,120
were not very satisfied with?

596
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,320
That’s not true.

597
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,120
I carefully prepared it for you.

598
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,200
You must finish it.

599
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,840
If...

600
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,760
you’d like to return me anything,

601
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,240
a piece of chocolate

602
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,360
with a card

603
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,800
would be fine with me.

604
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,960
I knew it.

605
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,400
You just want my chocolate.

606
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,040
Why would I want you chocolate?

607
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,960
There’s no need for that.

608
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,360
Here’s five yuan.

609
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,200
Buy one yourself.

610
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:52,800
Sure.

611
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,280
I’m an Aries.

612
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,520
Don’t forget to check
my constellation matching.

613
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,560
He took my money.

614
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,880
The one and only personality code

615
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,920
implies the essence of love.

616
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,880
Madam, you forgot to take off the label.

617
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,160
Do you need me to cut it for you?

618
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,160
I’m good.

619
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,000
I’ll do it myself.

620
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,600
Alright.

621
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,160
Thank you.

622
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,800
I have to return it.

623
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,160
It’d be a trouble if I cut it.

624
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,480
Hello.

625
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,120
Have a seat.

626
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,280
Okay, right,

627
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,640
here’s my resume.

628
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,800
It has all my working experiences on it.

629
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,360
Your resume says that

630
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,760
you have seven years
of sales experience?

631
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,640
Yeah, I’m very familiar with sales.

632
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,680
I was also the top salesperson.

633
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,280
I was also one of the best
regional salespersons.

634
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:57,640
What’s more...

635
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,680
I can see it.

636
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,440
Can you drink?

637
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,400
How much can you drink?

638
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,560
How do I say?

639
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,360
As

640
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,280
for beer,

641
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,640
maybe just a little.

642
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,320
What about...

643
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,760
Can you sing?

644
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,720
Your company requires singing skill?

645
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,720
Of course.

646
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,920
As a sales representative,

647
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,200
you have to sing after drinking

648
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,160
to warm up the atmosphere.

649
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,840
Plus, your job must be

650
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,960
very busy.

651
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,000
How come you have

652
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,920
extra energy to have
a part-time job here?

653
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,720
I’m just very energetic

654
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,400
and always keep myself busy.

655
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,840
I can practice singing.

656
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,240
I’ve gathered your

657
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,640
basic information.

658
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,320
Well,

659
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,560
we’ll get in touch with you soon.

660
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,240
Alright.

661
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,000
About singing,

662
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,840
I am good at some songs.

663
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,680
Alright.

664
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,480
See you.

665
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,560
Bye.

666
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,240
Goodbye.

667
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,520
Okay, bye.

668
00:30:57,268 --> 00:30:59,340
<i>Resume</i>

669
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,760
Miao,

670
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,960
both your dad and I are
working late tonight.

671
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,760
So, just warm up the food as dinner.

672
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,520
It’s in the fridge.

673
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,480
You only need to warm it up.

674
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,640
I got it.

675
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,600
Remember to wash the dishes
after you’re done.

676
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,280
I don’t want to wash them when
I get home in the late night.

677
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,120
Don’t worry, Mom.

678
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,600
Am I a kid with no self-management?

679
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,840
Alright, that’s all.

680
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,520
Bye-bye.

681
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:21,960
Bye-bye.

682
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,680
My time has finally come!

683
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,920
I’m going to watch television.

684
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,160
I’m coming!

685
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,200
I’m coming!

686
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,000
Coming now.

687
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,040
Coming!

688
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,000
I thought you were working late. Why...

689
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,040
It’s you.

690
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,080
Why didn’t you tell me?

691
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:30,104

692
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,040
Don’t we at least have

693
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,840
some basic sense of trust?

694
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,160
Am I a person with no self-control?

695
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,920
The back of the TV is wet.

696
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,560
Don’t forget to hang up the towel.

697
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,040
Let me check your quiz.

698
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,800
I can never escape from

699
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,960
the fate of being supervised.

700
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,800
When did you start matching?

701
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:03,920
No.

702
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,880
It’s a book from Shi Che.

703
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,240
She Che said he’s an Aries.

704
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,160
Let me see.

705
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:15,760
Here.

706
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,920
It does sound like him.

707
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,960
Let me see your star sign, Scorpio.

708
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,560
This book is pretty comprehensive.

709
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,720
It contains constellation matching…

710
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,480
and the couple compatibility scale.

711
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,560
Go hang up the towel.

712
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,200
Alright.

713
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,680
You’re so nagging.

714
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,180
<i>Sagittarius VS Aries -98%</i>

715
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:19,100
<i>Sagittarius VS Scorpio 99%</i>

716
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,040
What’s with your Politics quiz?

717
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,760
I didn’t know the answers.

718
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,160
Then why are you reading
this kind of book?

719
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,720
Figure out the answers first.

720
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,240
How come you could be my elder brother
just because you’re older?

721
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,320
Or what?

722
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,760
I’m not convinced.

723
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,800
Let’s have a competition.

724
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,280
Whoever wins is the elder brother.

725
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,400
You want to be my elder brother?

726
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,360
No.

727
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,480
If I win, I’m your elder sister.

728
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,680
Do you dare?

729
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,600
Sure. What’s the competition about?

730
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,520
I’m not gonna bully you.

731
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,840
How about

732
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,200
cat’s cradle?

733
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,240
Well?

734
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:18,560
Okay.

735
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,280
Have you played this before?

736
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,040
Then why are you so good at it?

737
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,920
Isn’t the game

738
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,120
a formation of point, line and plane?

739
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,240
You can solve it as long
as you know the theory.

740
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,200
That simple?

741
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:41,840
Yes.

742
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,160
Teach me.

743
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,000
Brother.

744
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,160
