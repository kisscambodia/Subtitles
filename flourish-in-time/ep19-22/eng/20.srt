Episode 20

30
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,940
The Faraway Moon Is Rounder

31
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,560
Mom, you’re back!

32
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,600
Slow down.

33
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,040
Miao.

34
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,720
Grandma, you’re back, too.

35
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,320
Where’s Grandpa?

36
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,720
Your grandpa is in hospital.

37
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,840
I’ll go to see him.

38
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,480
It’s late. You can go tomorrow.

39
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,720
After school.

40
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,040
Let your grandpa have a rest now.

41
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:32,760
Miao, you’re back.

42
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,280
Mom, I paved the bed for you.

43
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,520
In Miao’s room.

44
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,600
Don’t stay in the hospital.

45
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,720
Your waist will suffer.

46
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,680
Lu, thank you.

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,400
My pleasure.

48
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,880
Fang.

49
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,880
Don’t worry about me.

50
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,920
I’ll sleep on the sofa tonight.

51
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,920
No, you sleep in bed. Sofa is for me.

52
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,440
Miao, stay home with your grandma.

53
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,120
I’ll go to the hospital with your mom.

54
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,160
We’re leaving now.

55
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,600
Mom, will you come back tonight?

56
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,800
When your grandpa gets recovered,

57
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,120
I’ll have a talk with you.

58
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,720
Don’t worry.

59
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,120
We’re leaving now.

60
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,240
Be careful.

61
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,000
Bye.

62
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,360
Your grandpa is ill. Everyone is sad.

63
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,720
Grandma, what are you writing?

64
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,600
I’m recording what happened before

65
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,360
between your grandpa and me.

66
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,360
Grandma,

67
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,800
Grandpa will be fine.

68
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,520
He’ll get recovered.

69
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,840
Teachers’ Office

70
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,980
Don’t relax in the interview.

71
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,000
Don’t relax in the interview.

72
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,440
Your ideas and expressions
are equally important.

73
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,000
You must practice repeatedly.

74
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,360
Jiang Haoyue,

75
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,520
just perform as usual.

76
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,120
I’m confident to you.

77
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,360
What’s up?

78
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,080
I...

79
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,880
I want to give up the recommendation.

80
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,680
Are you crazy?

81
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,440
Why?

82
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,800
I’m going abroad.

83
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,480
So sudden!

84
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,800
You decided?

85
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,520
Go back then.

86
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,360
You’re doing handwork?!

87
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,360
As a simple-minded person,

88
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,760
you’re making such complex things?

89
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
I don’t know you now.

90
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,800
You block my light.

91
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,440
What are you making?

92
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,800
Safety bracelet, to ensure safety.

93
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,160
Who do you make it for?

94
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,640
My dad, mom, grandpa, grandma

95
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,200
and Jiang Haoyue.

96
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,960
I want safety, too, Meng.

97
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,040
Make one for me.

98
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,520
You can buy one if you want.

99
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,720
You can find it in the nearest shop.

100
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,840
I want you to make one for me.

101
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,400
Make one for me, Meng.

102
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,600
Don’t be so mean.

103
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,760
No, you’re not my family.

104
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,600
You can treat me as your family.

105
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,000
No, you’re not.

106
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,760
Lu Miao,

107
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,200
where are you going now?

108
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,560
I’ll go to visit my grandpa.

109
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,920
Your grandpa is back?

110
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,360
Yes. He comes to see the doctor.

111
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,720
I’ll go with you.

112
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,640
I want to see him, too.

113
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,700
Nanfeng Central Hospital

114
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,560
Grandma.

115
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,160
Miao,

116
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,920
Jiang, you are here.

117
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,440
Honey, wake up.

118
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,320
Miao and Jiang come to see you.

119
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,320
Wake up.

120
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,080
Come on.

121
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,840
Grandpa, I’m Miao.

122
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,080
Grandpa, I’m Haoyue.

123
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,040
He remembers you in his heart.

124
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,120
But

125
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,680
his brain

126
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,720
isn’t…

127
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,120
Grandma.

128
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,920
Grandma, don’t worry.

129
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,760
Grandpa will get recovered.

130
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,680
You are good kids.

131
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,360
Grandpa loses weight again.

132
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,560
Don’t worry.

133
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,160
Grandpa will get recovered.

134
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,400
Jiang Haoyue,
do you have anything to tell me?

135
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,200
No.

136
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,200
You must cheer up.

137
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,160
Che.

138
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,960
Let’s call it a day. Let’s go.

139
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,560
Time to go home.

140
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,240
Why? I tried so hard.

141
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,560
Why didn’t Lu Miao like me?

142
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,280
Love is between two.

143
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,520
There are so many girls.

144
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,720
Why not like another girl?

145
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,520
I think Ziye is good.

146
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,560
No.

147
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,560
I don’t think so.

148
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,920
What’s this?

149
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,800
Chen Lu asked you to go there?

150
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,380
I tell you. Don’t think about it.

151
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,660
I don’t agree.

152
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,800
I’ve grown up.

153
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,720
I’ll decide what I will do.

154
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,120
I’ve made an application.

155
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,160
My mom

156
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,720
will arrange everything for me abroad.

157
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,160
So no matter you agree or not,

158
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,400
I will go.

159
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,720
You go!

160
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,920
No matter I agree or not, right?

161
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,360
No matter I agree or not, right?

162
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,600
You go! You go!

163
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,040
Go!

164
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,200
You finished?

165
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,040
Remember to return the money
for the artificial limb to Mr. Lu.

166
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,800
Are you crazy?

167
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,560
Why do you mention this?

168
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,640
Take it as my debt.

169
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,160
I’ll pay you back.

170
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,200
How ambitious you are!

171
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,480
How will you pay me back?

172
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,560
Use Chen Lu’s money?

173
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,560
I tell you, Jiang Haoyue,

174
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,800
listen,

175
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,480
you’re my son no matter what!

176
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,840
You can’t get rid of me this life.

177
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,520
Dad, I’m back.

178
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,600
Miao,

179
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,440
your grandma is sleeping. Be quiet.

180
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,080
Dad, where is my mom?

181
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,040
She’s in the hospital.

182
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,680
I will

183
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,080
replace her later.

184
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,560
Miao,

185
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,840
what’s up?

186
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,080
You were happy when you went out.

187
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,120
Dad,

188
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,560
bring these two bracelets

189
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,240
to Mom and Grandpa,

190
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,440
to ensure safety.

191
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,120
You made it?

192
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,560
You’re smart.

193
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,040
You take one.

194
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,920
This is for me?

195
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,360
Yes.

196
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,360
I will always wear it.

197
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,440
Miao,

198
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,920
do you think I should do something

199
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,160
to make your mom happy?

200
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,320
I have an idea.

201
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,480
Here.

202
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,680
I’d better pretend not to know it,

203
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,280
and greet him.

204
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,120
What are you listening?

205
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,320
Are you so eager?

206
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:33,960
What did you say?

207
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,800
Jiang Haoyue will go abroad?

208
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,520
So sudden!

209
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,840
Not at all.

210
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,200
He wears headphone on the bus every day.

211
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,360
He’s listening to TOEFL.

212
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,120
I think he planned it long ago.

213
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,400
Fine. Don’t be angry.

214
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,640
He didn’t tell you,
maybe because he didn’t want you sad.

215
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,040
Ziye,

216
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,520
don’t explain for him.

217
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,640
I think he’s selfish.

218
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,800
He didn’t care Meng’s feeling at all.

219
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,360
What’s good about going abroad?

220
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,360
Why did he decide to do so?

221
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,920
Maybe there is delicious food.

222
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,640
Maybe there is
a better research environment.

223
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,600
Right?

224
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,120
Jiang Haoyue’s mom is there.

225
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,880
Mom,

226
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,720
can you send me your address again?

227
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,760
Hello, Mom, why the address you give me

228
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,800
is different from the previous one?

229
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,720
It’s like this.

230
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,240
Haoyue, I rent

231
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,520
an independent apartment for you.

232
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,400
Independent apartment?

233
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
I thought about it for a long time.

234
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,280
You know, I left China years ago.

235
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,120
I have a new family now.

236
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,040
I’m afraid
you don’t adapt to each other.

237
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,760
The apartment is close to your school.

238
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,440
There is a supermarket nearby.

239
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,880
You can buy everything there.

240
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,320
It’s very convenient.

241
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,280
Why didn’t you discuss it with me?

242
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,040
I’ve arranged everything well.

243
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,720
You know nothing about here.

244
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,840
I don’t want you to worry about it.

245
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,480
So, you didn’t plan

246
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,000
to live with me, right?

247
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,080
It’s not like this.

248
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,960
Haoyue, you wronged me.

249
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,120
Your brother is still young

250
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,000
and needs nursing.

251
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,720
When you come here,

252
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,800
you’ll meet everyone,

253
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,200
and you may not
get along very well, so...

254
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,980
I’ll go to class. That’s it.

255
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,100
Bye.

256
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,400
Slow down.

257
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,400
Be careful!

258
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,400
Hello, Auntie.

259
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:28,880
Hello.

260
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,400
I haven’t finished my homework.

261
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,520
I’m leaving now. See you, Auntie.

262
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,520
See you.

263
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,920
Mom.

264
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,640
I won’t get in.

265
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,040
I’ll leave after some words.

266
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,280
Does it hurt?

267
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,500
Yes, it does.

268
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,620
Mom. It hurts a lot!

269
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,680
Remember, put it in a safe place.

270
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,600
Never let him know it.

271
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
You can buy whatever you want.

272
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,960
You have to learn
to look after yourself.

273
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,600
You know?

274
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,240
Don’t cry. Men don’t cry.

275
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,000
Mom. I miss you.

276
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,240
I want you to come back.

277
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,880
Tell me when you’ll come back,

278
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,240
will you?

279
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,080
Haoyue, don’t wait for me.

280
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,280
I won’t come back to this home anymore.

281
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,160
Your dad is a bastard!

282
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,720
He won’t become a good one this life.

283
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,880
He won’t.

284
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,520
Mom, can you take me with you?

285
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,040
I’ll be good. I’ll be obedient.

286
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,560
I won’t make trouble for you.

287
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,280
Everyone praises me.

288
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,240
Haoyue, I can’t take you away now,

289
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,000
but I promise you

290
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,800
I will take you away from him one day.

291
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,800
Believe me, OK?

292
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,080
Keep it safe. Don’t let him know it.

293
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,000
Why do you cry?

294
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,320
Jiang Haoyue, don’t be sad.

295
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,760
You have me.

296
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,040
Jiang Haoyue!

297
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,200
When I first met you,

298
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,600
I hated you actually.

299
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,080
I was pretending to sleep.

300
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,800
You gave me chocolate by force.

301
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,920
Then, you moved upstairs,

302
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,600
and forced me to raise chicks with you.

303
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,000
You’re talkative every day,

304
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,400
more like a chick yourself.

305
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,600
In the middle school,

306
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,200
you fought many times for my leg.

307
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,960
You are a girl. How come you’re so rude?

308
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,200
But

309
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,120

00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,160
just run ahead.

346
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,000
You’ll find the answer at the end.

347
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,080
Where will you stop?

348
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,480
I’ll run around the levee.

349
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,880
Around?

350
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,880
Yeah.

351
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,040
It’s just about five kilometers.

352
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,720
It’s not that short.

353
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,200
I’m leaving now.

354
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,480
Mr. Lu, you really have good taste.

355
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,040
This sofa is sold very well.

356
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,280
Yes. When I take it home,

357
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,080
my wife will surely be happy.

358
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,960
By the way, Mr. Lu,

359
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,080
if you use delivery service,

360
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,640
you have to pay another 200 yuan.

361
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,280
Delivery needs pay?

362
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,600
Yeah. The product is on sale.

363
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,840
It’s still cost-effective
at such a price.

364
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,920
Well, I’ll take it home myself
at weekend.

365
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,720
Mr. Lu, please consider it again.

366
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,880
We have expert delivery men,

367
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,800
and they will put it in place for you.

368
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,040
If you take it yourself,

369
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,360
it’ll be a pity if you damage it.

370
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,400
Slow down.

371
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,880
Slow down.

372
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,760
Don’t bump it.

373
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:44,800
Don’t bump it.

374
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,160
Backward. Backward.

375
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,400
Backward.

376
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,200
Good.

377
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,100
Come on, Miao,

378
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,180
keep going.

379
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,640
One, two, three!

380
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,160
I can’t do it. I’ll have a rest.

381
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,480
Have a rest.

382
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,640
Dad, don’t save money on this
in the future.

383
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,760
It seems I overestimate myself.

384
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,440
My mom will be home soon.

385
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,560
Don’t turn this surprise into

386
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,520
a scare.

387
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,080
Nonsense! I know your mom well.

388
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,120
She always wanted a sofa.

389
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,000
I’m sure she’ll like it.

390
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,520
This must be a surprise.

391
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:33,720
Miao,

392
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,200
come on, keep going.

393
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,880
Let me have a rest, Dad.

394
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,000
It’s enough. Come on.

395
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,840
I’ll massage your shoulder later, OK?

396
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,880
Give me a hand.

397
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,440
Come on!

398
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,160
One, two, three!

399
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,840
Did you see an old woman?

400
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,000
She’s in blue T-shirt

401
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,880
and black trousers.

402
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,720
No.

403
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,360
No.

404
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,520
No.

405
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,360
Thank you!

406
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,640
Ms. Fang, what’s up?

407
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,680
Miao’s grandma was lost.

408
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,440
I just answered a call,

409
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,520
she... She was gone.

410
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,160
She doesn’t answer the call, either.

411
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,360
So Grandma took the phone
before she went missing, right?

412
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,520
Yeah. Yes.

413
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,400
But she doesn’t answer my call now.

414
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,520
I’ll check her location for you.

415
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,320
I take you here.

416
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,600
Shouldn’t you pay?

417
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,240
What? Take me here?

418
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,520
You take a wrong way, young guys.

419
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,480
If you weren’t old,

420
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,560
I would beat you.

421
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,640
Dare you!

422
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,440
Who are you?

423
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,840
You dare to extort the elderly.

424
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,000
Look what you did.

425
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,560
You’re not qualified to be a rascal.

426
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,120
You ask for a beat!

427
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,120
Freeze!

428
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,420
Sir, I’m wrong!

429
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,380
Forgive me!

430
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,080
Forgive you?

431
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,440
Wait here!

432
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:51,960
Get out of here!

433
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,960
Don’t show up before me!

434
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,680
Mom.

435
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,400
Grandma.

436
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,760
Why are you here?

437
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,840
I want to do some exercises.

438
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,440
When I came here,

439
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,680
I met two rascals.

440
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,080
Luckily I met Jiang.

441
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,000
Thanks.

442
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,040
Not at all.

443
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,760
Let’s go back together.

444
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:13,880
I’m busy now.

445
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,040
I threw your passport away.

446
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,760
Passport?

447
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:30,900
It’s nothing.

448
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:31,940
Let’s go, Grandma.

449
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,880
OK. Mom, let’s go.

450
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,000
Be careful!

451
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,480
Miao, come on.

452
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,240
I can’t do it.

453
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,160
One, two, three!

454
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,680
I can’t do it.

455
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,800
Keep going.

456
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,120
One, two, three!

457
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,360
I can’t move it.

458
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,880
What are you doing?

459
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,360
Mom,

460
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,840
this... This is a surprise for you.

461
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,640
I think our sofa is too old.

462
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,160
I bought a new one.

463
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,200
Let me help you.

464
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,880
Go give him a hand.

465
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,440
Come!

466
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,680
One, two, three!

467
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,040
Return it!

468
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,960
But this is

469
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,640
what my dad specially prepared for you.

470
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,720
We don’t have spare money

471
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,120
to buy a sofa.

472
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,120
Well, it’s on sale now.

473
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,920
It’s cheap.

474
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,720
Moreover, I

475
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,920
take it home by myself.

476
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,040
No delivery fee.

477
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,960
Miao’s grandpa needs money
for treatment.

478
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,480
Miao needs money for tutoring class.

479
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:48,880
Do you think

480
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,720
we have spare money to make romance?

481
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,480
You always said I’m vulgar.

482
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,800
Yes, I am.

483
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,120
If I don’t think about money,

484
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,880
how can we make a living?

485
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,720
And can what happened between us

486
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,880
be solved by money?

487
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,280
Or by a sofa you bought?

488
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,080
Mom, why do you say this?

489
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,480
Dad bought this sofa

490
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,200
to give you a surprise.

491
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,200
Maybe we shouldn’t buy it,

492
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,640
but what’s wrong with Dad?

493
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,320
He just wanted to make you happy.

494
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,440
Why should we connect everything

495
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,880
with money?

496
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,000
Is money really so important?

497
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,480
What we did is just to make you stay.

498
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,560
We don’t want you to leave.

499
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,040
Why can’t you understand us?

500
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,400
Lu Miao,

501
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,760
calm down. Ms. Fang doesn’t mean this.

502
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,280
Don’t drag me.

503
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,920
You’ve decided to leave.

504
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,040
Don’t meddle into our business again.

505
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,480
Jiang,

506
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,080
give me a hand.

507
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,400
Here, Jiang,

508
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,480
have a rest here.

509
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,160
OK.

510
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Is your leg alright?

511
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:46,960
Yes.

512
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,680
Mr. Lu, have a seat.

513
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,840
Jiang,

514
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,280
you’re going abroad?

515
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,400
Everything is arranged well.

516
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,240
You didn’t mention it before.

517
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,920
I wasn’t sure.

518
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,000
Jiang, if you can develop well abroad

519
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,960
and stay with your mom,

520
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,960
I support you.

521
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,360
But if you go abroad

522
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,160
because you think you’re a burden,

523
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,040
I don’t agree with you.

524
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,200
Although I didn’t do everything well,

525
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,520
for all these years,

526
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,360
I treated you as my own son.

527
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,720
I don’t think you’re a burden.

528
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,880
Mr. Lu,

529
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,160
frankly, I think

530
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,800
everything is good for me to go abroad.

531
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,760
Time flies.

532
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,560
You’re 18 years old now.

533
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,240
You’re an adult.

534
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,320
You can decide what you do.

535
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,560
I respect your choice.

536
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,760
But if

537
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,880
you don’t adapt to the life there,

538
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,200
welcome back at any time.

539
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,320
Mr. Lu.

540
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,320
For all these years,

541
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,080
thank you.

542
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,560
Miao.

543
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,120
Don’t cry.

544
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,000
You may suffocate.

545
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,000
Where’s Mom?

546
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,000
She stays at the hospital tonight.

547
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,320
She must be angry with me.

548
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,360
She won’t.

549
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,600
She’s just more bark than bite.

550
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,800
Didn’t you see

551
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,480
she wears the bracelet

552
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,440
you sent her?

553
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,440
Dad,

554
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,840
I want to go to the hospital tomorrow

555
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,440
and apologize to her.

556
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,880
OK. I’ll send you there, OK?

557
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,920
What about Jiang?

558
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,240
What will you do to him?

559
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,160
Nothing.

560
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,120
Miao?

561
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,880
Why are you here alone?

562
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,600
Where’s your dad?

563
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,880
He’s downstairs.

564
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,200
How’s Grandpa?

565
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,120
He’s sleeping.

566
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,640
Tomorrow morning,

567
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,120
we’ll go back to our hometown.

568
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,560
Is Grandpa recovered?

569
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,480
Mom.

570
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:45,960
Sorry.

571
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,080
My dad and I were wrong.

572
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,080
You have great pressure.
I still made trouble for you.

573
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,200
No, it’s my fault.

574
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,200
I was wrong, too.

575
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,520
It’s fine.

576
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,960
Will you and Dad get divorced?

577
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,320
Let’s talk about it later.

578
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,800
I have to look after your grandpa now.

579
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,440
Will Grandpa get well after going back?

580
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,600
Don’t worry.

581
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,560
Accompany him more.

582
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,120
Go, go accompany him.

583
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,840
Come on. It’s fine.
