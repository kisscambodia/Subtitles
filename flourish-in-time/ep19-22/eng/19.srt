30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,140
Response from God

31
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,680
Jiang Haoyue, leave me alone.

32
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,320
Time to go home.

33
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,560
I don’t want to.

34
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,680
No one is home, anyway.

35
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,220
Have some water to calm down.

36
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,800
You know what?

37
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,840
I was very happy

38
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,400
to tell my mom about my scores.

39
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,280
I thought she’d come back,

40
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,320
but she asked me

41
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,160
which one I would choose.

42
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,040
My dad or her?

43
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,240
I never expected

44
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,320
such kind of irrational event

45
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,360
would happen to me.

46
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,520
Jiang,

47
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,240
tell me a story, OK?

48
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,680
What kind of story?

49
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,840
I want to listen to

50
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,080
a warm

51
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,800
and sweet

52
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,520
fairy story about love.

53
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,620
Once upon a time,

54
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,640
Ms. Rabbit

55
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,960
opened a mushroom shop in a village.

56
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,120
One day,

57
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,640
Mr. Dog who always wandered around

58
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,600
happened to pass by.

59
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,840
Come on.

60
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,720
He was falling in love with

61
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,800
Ms. Rabbit at first sight.

62
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,360
But Mr. Dog

63
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,320
liked entertainment

64
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,760
and had bad reputation.

65
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,040
So, Ms. Rabbit

66
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,680
refused to date with him.

67
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,880
One day,

68
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,600
a local tyrant Wolf

69
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,800
came to Ms. Rabbit’s mushroom shop

70
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,040
and threatened her

71
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,480
to send him mushroom

72
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,800
every day.

73
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,520
For protection.

74
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,360
Or he’d destroy her shop.

75
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,760
Why does your fairy story

76
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,160
have protection fee?

77
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,200
Do you want me to continue?

78
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,760
Yes.

79
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,360
Go ahead.

80
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,280
Continue.

81
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:00,960
Later…

82
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:01,920
Bro!

83
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,640
The news

84
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,440
was heard by Mr. Dog.

85
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,080
Gosh!

86
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,080
Mr. Dog came to stop Wolf immediately.

87
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,600
Stop!

88
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,200
Sir, please!

89
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,760
Please don’t!

90
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,280
Smash it!

91
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,000
Freeze!

92
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,480
Stop it.

93
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,200
Ms. Rabbit was sad

94
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,360
and felt sorry.

95
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,640
Step into my business?

96
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,240
No.

97
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,320
Then,

98
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,240
Mr. Dog

99
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,760
bit the Wolf’s neck,

100
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,280
and Wolf fell in blood.

101
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,840
Then, this matter was reported

102
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,360
to the village head,

103
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,840
and Mr. Dog was caught.

104
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,760
How could justice be at disadvantage?

105
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,640
Several years later,

106
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,960
Mr. Dog was released.

107
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,800
He still loved Ms. Rabbit

108
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,000
and proposed to her.

109
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,200
I don’t have any skills

110
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,240
or money.

111
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,880
He told Ms. Rabbit that

112
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,520
he could

113
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,800
give up his life for her.

114
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,480
Ms. Rabbit was moved

115
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,000
and agreed his proposal.

116
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,480
The love story ends here.

117
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,040
What happened next?

118
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,960
You want to know?

119
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,360
Tell me more.

120
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,000
Mr. Dog and Ms. Rabbit

121
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,640
had a baby soon.

122
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,200
It’s Cat.

123
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,680
Rabbit

124
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,480
and Dog.

125
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,120
Why should they have a kid Cat?

126
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,400
I’ll be quiet. You continue.

127
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,560
Continue.

128
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,000
Milk is coming.

129
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,680
Later,

130
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:36,800
Ms. Rabbit

131
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,920
was always busy doing her business

132
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,920
and looking after their baby.

133
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,840
But Mr. Dog always

134
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,040
sneaked into the mushroom shop

135
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,320
and stole the most expensive mushroom.

136
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,000
Jiang Haoyue.

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,720
He always came home drunk.

138
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,440
Smile.

139
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,040
You’re back.

140
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,680
Good. You feed him.

141
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,320
I’ll cook.

142
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,000
Someone is waiting for me.

143
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,600
What?

144
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,560
I can’t do it myself.

145
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,280
Come on.

146
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,160
Stop it!

147
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,680
I told you. I can’t do it myself.

148
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,280
Someone is waiting. I’m going!

149
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,720
Jiang Yi, will you go to drink again?

150
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,360
Ms. Rabbit

151
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,600
and Mr. Dog

152
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,760
argued many times.

153
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,840
But Mr. Dog…

154
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,520
Here, baby.

155
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,120
Has never changed his bad habit.

156
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,240
Mr. Dog could give up his life

157
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,200
for Ms. Rabbit,

158
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,840
but why couldn’t he

159
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,080
change his habit?

160
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,360
Yeah.

161
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,640
Mr. Dog could give up his life

162
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,440
for Ms. Rabbit,

163
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,600
but couldn’t live ordinary life

164
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,800
with her.

165
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:40,840
You can bet now.

166
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,880
Is this OK?

167
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,280
Yes.

168
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,480
Straight!

169
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,720
This is our bill.

170
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,640
We only have money out,

171
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,360
nothing in.

172
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,000
Have a look.

173
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,000
Jiang Yi, tell me,

174
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,480
will you make a living?

175
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,160
What are you doing?

176
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,200
Beat me? Come on!

177
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,520
You can only do this, right?

178
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,760
You can’t make money.

179
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,200
You can only beat me.

180
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,880
You said it. Right?

181
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,800
- Beat me!
- You asked for it!

182
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,080
I can’t make money?

183
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,000
You can’t!

184
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,160
Ms. Rabbit decided to

185
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,760
leave Mr. Dog finally.

186
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,120
What about their kid Cat?

187
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,680
Ms. Rabbit thought Cat was a trouble,

188
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,600
and

189
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,760
left him behind.

190
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,120
Cat liked to

191
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,000
stay with Mr. Dog.

192
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,440
One day,

193
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,240
Cat went to a hill

194
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,400
and fell in the valley,

195
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,520
breaking one of his legs.

196
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,240
But luckily,

197
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,560
Cat met Chick in the valley.

198
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,920
Chick has round head,

199
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,680
big eyes,

200
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,800
and twitters every day.

201
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,320
She’s very happy every day.

202
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,840
Cat and Chick grow up together.

203
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,280
Chick has worries suddenly.

204
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,280
She begins to worry about

205
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,120
the world outside the valley.

206
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,920
Someday in the future,

207
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,280
Chick will have to leave the valley.

208
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,960
What should she do

209
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,800
to face the strange world outside?

210
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,120
Cat holds Chick’s hands and says,

211
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,880
“Look at me when you’re scared.

212
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,040
I have visited

213
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,280
the outside world for you.”

214
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,400
You’re upset?

215
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,080
No.

216
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,360
Look, give me a smile.

217
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,080
I’ll give you a smile.

218
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,360
Leave me alone.

219
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,800
What happened to you?

220
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,000
My parents may divorce.

221
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,320
Why?

222
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,600
What happened?

223
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,680
I thought it was because of
my bad performance.

224
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,080
But it seems that I was wrong.

225
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,560
I can do nothing to help.

226
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,640
If your parents divorce

227
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,640
and get married with others,

228
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,960
you’ll get four red packets

229
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,360
in the Spring Festival.

230
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,240
So they divorce because

231
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,520
they want to marry others?

232
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,520
No.

233
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,840
I didn’t mean that.

234
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,640
Meng, I spoke out of turn.

235
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,080
Shut up now.

236
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,200
How about this?

237
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,240
This is a supreme comic card.

238
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,200
Swipe it anytime with my name.

239
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,680
Take it as my apology.

240
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,760
Teachers’ Office

241
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,680
Nothing serious.

242
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,760
I just want to know

243
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,560
something about Lu Miao.

244
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,280
What’s wrong with her?

245
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,680
She’s not in good state recently.

246
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,560
She slept in the class.

247
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,480
Now she even doesn’t do homework.

248
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,840
So I want to know

249
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,880
what happened to her.

250
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,920
I know

251
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,160
you’ve been supervising her study.

252
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,600
I hope you can

253
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,920
help her make some adjustments.

254
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,600
If she continues like this,

255
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,040
I will inform her parents.

256
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,640
I see.

257
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,760
Don’t inform her parents.
I’ll speak to her.

258
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,520
This is what I mean.

259
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,400
Uncle Lu.

260
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,240
Jiang,

261
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,320
you’re back so late.

262
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,000
Go back to have rest now.

263
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,000
Uncle Lu,

264
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,800
you didn’t smoke before.

265
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,240
Well,

266
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,640
I smoked occasionally.

267
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,080
Will

268
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,000
Aunt Fang come back?

269
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,920
She will.

270
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,240
Uncle Lu,

271
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,480
are you arguing with Aunt Fang

272
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,320
for me?

273
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,440
Silly boy,

274
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,280
you’re over thinking.

275
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,120
How could it be for you?

276
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,160
Go home and study now.

277
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,280
Come on.

278
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,600
I’ll add some fuel for my car.

279
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,280
Come on.

280
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,380
30th day of this month,

281
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:01,600
Blue moon is coming
30th day of this month,

282
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,320
Blue moon is coming
the second full moon will come.

283
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,680
The one who loves astronomy

284
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,380
may witness the wonder of blue moon.

285
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,320
may witness the wonder of blue moon.

286
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,680
How to make a webpage?

287
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,280
Look at this place.

288
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,280
I think we should make some adjustment.

289
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,200
But the text is not enough.

290
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,640
Jiang Haoyue,

291
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,160
are you kidnapped?

292
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,800
Look what you are doing now.

293
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,320
“Miracle Comes” Make A Wish

294
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,300
Fantasy girl style.

295
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:46,320
Fantasy girl style.

296
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,640
Isn’t it good?

297
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,040
It took me several hours last night.

298
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,400
For Lu Miao?

299
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,800
She’s upset recently.

300
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,400
I should do something

301
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,320
to cheer her up.

302
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,000
Life is difficult.

303
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,440
Even you begin to do this.

304
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,200
But I don’t think

305
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,640
Lu Miao will like it.

306
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,040
She’s is girlish.

307
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,800
Are you sure she’s girlish,

308
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,680
not boyish?

309
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,640
Jiang,

310
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,040
why are you here?

311
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,760
Don’t you have night classes?

312
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,200
It’s 9:30 PM.

313
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,320
It’s so late.

314
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,480
Are you coming to ask me back?

315
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,480
I don’t want to go home now.

316
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,560
I’ll read some books here with you.

317
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,360
Look at this.

318
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,040
Don’t you want to make a wish?

319
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,880
It must be deceptious.

320
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,400
Don’t you believe it?

321
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,520
But this leaflet is obviously fake.

322
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,040
Look at this edge.

323
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,560
It must be drawn by hand.

324
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,100
“Miracle Comes” Make A Wish

325
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,040
Look at this side.

326
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,560
There’s a website.

327
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,240
Why not log in and have a try?

328
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:21,880

Enter lucky number.

00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,480
wishing coin with your lucky number,

342
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,120
come to No. 24, Qinglongwu,

344
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,800
your eudemon will come to wishing pool

345
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,680
to realize your dream.

346
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,120
Not 19.

347
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,560
It’s not easy to get it.

348
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,000
I think this webpage is good.

349
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Why don’t you

350
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,600
try again?

351
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,680
Since you said so,

352
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,680
I will try again.

353
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,200
Not again.

354
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,120
Why doesn’t it come out?

355
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,880
She really believes it?

356
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,880
How could you ensure

357
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,680
she’ll get her lucky number?

358
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,960
It’s preset that the entered number

359
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,200
will come out after 50 tries.

360
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,480
50 tries?

361
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,520
How could you ensure

362
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,280
she won’t give up before 50 tries?

363
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,840
She will never give up.

364
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,160
Still trying?

365
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,440
Not again.

366
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,280
1 to 999.

367
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,800
There are a lot of possibilities.

368
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,480
Why not share the website link to me?

369
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,600
Let me give you a hand.

370
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,560
Can it be done this way?

371
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,720
The Wishing Guide

372
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,520
doesn’t specify it.

373
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,760
Forget it.

374
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,720
I should be sincere to make a wish.

375
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,760
I’ll do it myself.

376
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:48,960
I got it.

377
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,360
Impossible.

378
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,400
You got it?

379
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,760
I got it!

380
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,440
Well...

381
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,520
Is this the wishing pool?

382
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,800
It’s too scaring.

383
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,640
You see it now.

384
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,320
You may leave.

385
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,120
Are you sure?

386
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,600
You have a lot of work to do.

387
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,840
You can’t do it without me.

388
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,800
How did you find

389
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,840
such a shabby place?

390
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,240
I came here when I was a kid.

391
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,840
Hang all the wishing cards on the tree.

392
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,280
Well...

393
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,240
This tree is too big.

394
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,520
Jiang Haoyue,

395
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,600
it must be the first coin you made.

396
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,280
Thank you for your help.

397
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,520
Look,

398
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,680
Lu Miao is a high school student.

399
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,040
Will she believe this?

400
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
You have no idea.

401
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,480
She’s curious about everything

402
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,800
that science can’t explain.

403
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,680
For example,

404
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,840
she always bows to Conan

405
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,880
before exam

406
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,760
and draws lots before leaving home.

407
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,240
Or why would I

408
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,400
make such a coin for her?

409
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,800
I never expected materialistic

410
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,480
Jiang Haoyue would do this.

411
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,120
Sometimes, there is only a fine line

412
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,440
between Science and metaphysics.

413
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,080
30th day of this month,

414
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,560
the blue moon will come.

415
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,960
I knew you had something in reserve.

416
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,320
But what if it rains that day?

417
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,800
The blue moon won’t come in rain.

418
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,240
I checked it.

419
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:18,920
It’ll be sunny that day.

420
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,640
I’ll make her believe again that

421
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,960
miracle will happen.

422
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,560
It looks more like a wishing place.

423
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,200
Let’s go.

424
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,360
You received it?

425
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,040
I want to make a wish, too.

426
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,880
It’s too late.

427
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,040
I accumulate luck every day.

428
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,160
Never mind.

429
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,920
I’ll do it next year.

430
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,280
Don’t bother.

431
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,880
It’s just a coin.

432
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,480
Game coin is the same.

433
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,040
Jiang Haoyue.

434
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,080
Look.

435
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,400
This is my exclusive wishing coin.

436
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,360
I spent many days to get it.

437
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,640
Am I lucky?

438
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,520
I think this wishing coin

439
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,360
is really special.

440
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,520
Really?

441
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,760
You have good taste.

442
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,720
Let’s go. Time for class.

443
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,840
I’m leaving now.

444
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,320
Dad,

445
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,000
what’s wrong?

446
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,240
I got burned.

447
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,320
These days,

448
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,200
I felt more about how hard

449
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,560
your mom worked before.

450
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,640
She had to make money

451
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,400
and look after both of us.

452
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,480
I miss

453
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,600
the braised pork chops my mom cooked.

454
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,640
Hello, are you Lu Yongfei?

455
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,120
Do you know Jiang Yi?

456
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,680
Yes.

457
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,080
What’s the matter?

458
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,720
He’s in our police station now.

459
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:26,960
What?

460
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,560
Come here now.

461
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,320
I’ll be there soon.

462
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,520
Have a drink?

463
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,920
With you?

464
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,320
Don’t you like betting?

465
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,680
Dare you bet with me?

466
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,440
For what?

467
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,920
If I drink more than you,

468
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,440
you quit betting.

469
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,280
Lu Yongfei,

470
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,440
I never lose to anyone in drinking.

471
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,560
Let’s go!

472
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,360
Drink!

473
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,560
Jiang Haoyue?

474
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,520
Are you going to make a wish?

475
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:48,840
Yes.

476
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,040
Looks like it’ll rain.

477
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,680
Why don’t you

478
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,440
quit?

479
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,720
No.

480
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,960
The leaflet says

481
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,240
that it’s a good day
to make wishes tonight.

482
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,360
She’s happy now.

483
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,280
I’d better not let her down.

484
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,560
I’ll go with you.

485
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:05,880
Don’t bother.

486
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,560
If it does rain,

487
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,560
it’ll be troublesome.

488
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:09,840
Let’s go.

489
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,680
Are you very curious?

490
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,680
Can you drink more?

491
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,280
Here,

492
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,560
cheers!

493
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,200
Cheers!

494
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,280
What do you mean?

495
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,080
You can’t drink?

496
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,000
You lose, right?

497
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,120
From now on,

498
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,000
can you stop coming to me for help?

499
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,680
I beg you!

500
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,040
Who can I come to?

501
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,200
I have no money.

502
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,600
Should I come to Jiang Haoyue?

503
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,200
Look,

504
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,680
you’re a good guy.

505
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,160
But

506
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,480
you hit my son.

507
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,800
You owe us

508
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,600
for all your life.

509
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,160
I admit

510
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,320
that I owe you,

511
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,520
but why should my wife and daughter

512
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,920
suffer with me?

513
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,800
Why?

514
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,560
I owe Jiang Haoyue.

515
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,120
I owe my wife.

516
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,360
I owe Miao.

517
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,920
But I

518
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,480
never owe you,

519
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,360
Jiang Yi!

520
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,680
You hear that?

521
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,440
I never owe you!

522
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,080
But you met me.

523
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,040
You deserve it!

524
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,760
Jiang Yi!

525
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,240
What?

526
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,820
Why not behave yourself?

527
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,400
Spicy Hot Pot
Why not behave yourself?

528
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,720
It’s cold today.

529
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,080
Let’s go back soon.

530
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,000
I’m afraid you may get sick.

531
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,240
I’m fine.

532
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,680
This is Qinglongwu.

533
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,920
It’s shabby here.

534
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,160
And it’s cold.

535
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,560
Why not make your wish the other day?

536
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,080
Maybe this eudemon

537
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,240
is so unusual.

538
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,120
Look, there is no one else.

539
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,080
It’s impossible to realize your wish.

540
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,720
Why not come the other day?

541
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,000
The fewer people, the better.

542
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,840
Then I’ll be an exclusive VIP

543
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,440
for this eudemon tonight.

544
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,840
I’ll make my wish now.

545
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,600
I wish...

546
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,920
I wish...

547
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,280
Bad luck!

548
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,280
Bad luck!

549
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,320
What are you doing?

550
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,280
I’ll go find it.

551
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,720
It’s too cold to stay in water.

552
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,800
It’s fine. I saw it falling in water.

553
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,720
I’ll surely find it.

554
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:08,840
No.

555
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,000
What if you get ill?

556
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,560
I won’t.

557
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,080
Don’t worry.

558
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,480
How could it be?

559
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,280
I’ll be anxious if you get ill.

560
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,160
You know?

561
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,160
It’s fine. I won’t get ill.

562
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,080
And there will be a blue moon tonight.

563
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,520
I will find my coin to make a wish.

564
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,800
It’s fake.

565
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,560
There is no eudemon,

566
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,840
no miracle.

567
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,720
No one believes this wishing pool now.

568
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,240
You believe it.

569
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,680
I know you believe.

570
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,480
When we were kids,

571
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,400
I saw you come here.

572
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,640
This is the only place you made a wish.

573
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,160
The wish I made then

574
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,360
hasn’t come true till now.

575
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,000
Do you give up?

576
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,160
I won’t give up.

577
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,040
Although I don’t know
what your wish was,

578
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,920
I believe it can come true one day.

579
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,800
So the wish I’ll make

580
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,480
will come true, too.

581
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,800
Jiang Haoyue, why are you here?

582
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,760
I’ll help you.

583
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,120
No. Jiang Haoyue, leave here.

584
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,400
Let’s find it now.

585
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,280
No. Leave here now.

586
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,160
I’ll leave after we find it.

587
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,480
I don’t want it. Let’s go now.

588
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,840
Didn’t you say

589
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,760
you wouldn’t give up?

590
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,800
But

591
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,320
your leg...

592
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:22,760
It’s fine.

593
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,720
Let’s go.

594
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,760
I mean it.

595
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,520

does grandpa

642
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,160
feel better now?

643
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,160
Yes.

644
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,880
In a few days,

645
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,040
I’ll take grandpa

646
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,680
to a hospital near our home.

647
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,360
You mean you’re back?

648
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,080
Great!

649
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,560
Mom, look outside now.

650
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,040
Tonight,

651
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,480
the moon is blue.

652
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,840
It seems that my dad is back.

653
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,120
I’ll tell him this.

654
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,200
Dad.

655
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,520
Dad.

656
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,320
My mom said she’d be back soon.

657
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,000
Great!

658
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,560
What’s wrong, Dad?

659
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,160
I’m fine.

660
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,360
Let me see.

661
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,800
How did you get hurt?

662
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,600
It’s slippery outside.

663
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,040
I fell down. It doesn’t matter.

664
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,320
Come on.

665
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,040
Sit on the sofa.

666
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,080
I’ll deal with it for you. Come.

667
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,000
How could you get hurt?

668
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,480
Is it hurt?

669
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,000
No.

670
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,600
Miao,

671
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,320
I want to tell you the truth.

672
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,240
What’s it?

673
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,880
Your mom

674
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,000
is angry

675
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,040
not because of money,

676
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,240
or your performance at school.

677
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,400
It’s all my fault.

678
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,680
I am too selfish.

679
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,960
Your mom is right.

680
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,320
I am not a real good man.

681
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,320
These years,

682
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,760
I wanted to be responsible for Jiang,

683
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,400
but I

684
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,400
ignored you and your mom’s feelings.

685
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,320
Sorry.

686
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,960
Dad,

687
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,160
Jiang Haoyue is our family too.

688
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,000
I support you

689
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,440
on this.

690
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,440
Miao.

691
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,840
My mom will understand you

692
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,800
like me.

693
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,400
She loves us so much.

694
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,960
She won’t leave this home,

695
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:50,840
am I right?

696
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,120
You fought again?

697
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,520
Lu Yongfei was

698
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,680
upset at home.

699
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,680
He vented anger on me.

700
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,080
Luckily, I’m strong enough

701
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,200
to beat him.

702
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,200
You beat Uncle Lu?

703
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,440
Why?

704
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,480
I am your dad, not him.

705
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,160
Just because of money.

706
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:50,840
Bail Bill

707
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,680
Lin Wenfang’s reluctant to pay for you.

708
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,740
She’s angry and gone.

709
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:56,760
She’s angry and gone.

710
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,800
Lu Yongfei

711
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,440
is crazy.

712
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,280
The artificial leg was paid by Uncle Lu.

713
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,840
So Aunt Fang and Uncle Lu argued

714
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,520
because of you.

715
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,360
Why are you mad at me?

716
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,480
They hit your leg.

717
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,880
They should pay for it.

718
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,720
Do you remember what my mom said?

719
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:05,960
She said,

720
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:07,960
you

721
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,080
are a bastard!

722
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,080
I won’t let you hurt them again.

723
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,560
Behave yourself.

724
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,440
Mom,

725
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,440
I decide to come to you.

726
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,360
Finally you think it through.

727
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,520
I want to go there soon.

728
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,840
OK. I’ll hand the formalities.

729
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,800
I’m so glad that

730
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,000
we can reunite soon.

731
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,840
When you come abroad,

732
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,720
we can get rid of Jiang Yi completely.

733
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,720
I wish my mom can come to see me soon.

734
00:44:02,744 --> 00:44:17,744
