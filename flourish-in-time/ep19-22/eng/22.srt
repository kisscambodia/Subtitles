00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,580
Spring of Lost Love Alliance

31
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,140
Spring of Lost Love Alliance
It’s for me?

32
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:05,800
It’s for me?

33
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,760
Mm.

34
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,540
How’s it? Is it delicious?

35
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,960
Are you really not going to leave?

36
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:36,680
Mm.

37
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,960
This?

38
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,080
Just forget it.

39
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,720
I just said it casually.

40
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,080
It’s good for you to study abroad.

41
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,440
It’s the same in China.

42
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,680
What’s more,

43
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,040
it’s my decision.

44
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,600
Well…

45
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,760
what about Ms. Chen?

46
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,520
Whether I go abroad or not

47
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,160
doesn’t really matter

48
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,160
to her.

49
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,080
After long escape,

50
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,280
I have to learn to

51
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,440
face it, right?

52
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,680
Fortunately,

53
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,640
when that day comes,

54
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,760
I’m strong enough

55
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,280
to face them.

56
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,800
Jiang Haoyue.

57
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,800
No matter where you go

58
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,320
and what you want to do,

59
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,320
I will stay with you.

60
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,240
Then

61
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,280
keep your words.

62
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,960
Tell me,

63
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,360
if the end of the world is the sea,

64
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,240
where does the sea end?

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,840
The sky.

66
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,320
Where does the sky end?

67
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,800
Maybe the universe.

68
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,560
Where does

69
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,240
the universe end?

70
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,600
The chocolate.

71
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,720
You can eat as much as you like.

72
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,160
Uncle, let me help you.

73
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,840
Don’t bother, Jiang.

74
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,520
I can do it myself. It’s okay.

75
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,320
Don’t get your shoes dirty.

76
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,120
Okay.

77
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,360
Come here. You wash this side.

78
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,080
Okay.

79
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,440
Jiang.

80
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,640
Miao told me

81
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,800
that you are not going abroad.

82
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,040
Yes.

83
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,760
If you’re worried about your dad

84
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,840
or about us,

85
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,080
there’s no need for it.

86
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,280
Just do what you want.

87
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,000
Uncle.

88
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,280
Let bygones

89
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,920
be bygones.

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,320
It’s my life.

91
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,880
I should learn to live with it.

92
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,680
In fact,

93
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,200
it’s my choice to stay here.

94
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,000
Follow my heart,

95
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,840
and I’ll live more comfortably.

96
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,760
Thanks for your kindness.

97
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,980
I’ll repay you in the future.

98
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,520
Fees of medicine, rehabilitation
I’ll repay you in the future.

99
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,060
and others are 2,737 yuan

100
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,840
Mr. Lu.

101
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,640
Don’t just stand there.

102
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,000
Help me wash the car.

103
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,120
You brat.

104
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,200
Okay.

105
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,640
Wash it clean.

106
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,840
The soup is ready.

107
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,760
Jiang.

108
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,680
Have a taste of my cooking.

109
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,080
Mr. Lu, it looks delicious.

110
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,520
Come on. Help yourself.

111
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,200
Miao, eat.

112
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,920
If only my mom were here now.

113
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,080
When your grandpa gets better,

114
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,480
your mom will come back.

115
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,160
Let’s eat.

116
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,400
Your mom’s call.

117
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,640
Is she coming back?

118
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,280
Fang.

119
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,040
I know.

120
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What’s the matter, Dad?

121
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,160
Is she coming back?

122
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,280
Miao.

123
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,120
Let’s pack up after dinner

124
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,960
and go to your grandpa’s home.

125
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,520
Your grandpa...

126
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,880
There are still dishes.

127
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,520
Help yourselves.

128
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,960
Miao.

129
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
Help yourselves.

130
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:32,920
Fang.

131
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,120
Miao, you’re here.

132
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,480
Mom.

133
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,000
Let me introduce you.

134
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,400
This is your uncle.

135
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,840
Hello, uncle.

136
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,080
Here you are.

137
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,800
Miao,

138
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,840
sit over there with your aunt.

139
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,040
Sit here.

140
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,040
Help yourselves.

141
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,320
Let’s sit together.

142
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,440
Help yourselves.

143
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,080
Okay.

144
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,200
Are you alright?

145
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,480
I’m fine.

146
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,920
Look what your grandpa brought for you.

147
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,560
Let me see.

148
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,840
Your favorite snacks.

149
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,080
Thank you, Grandpa.

150
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,440
Remember,

151
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,120
don’t let your grandma and mom see it.

152
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,320
Got it.

153
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,600
Go. Let’s go home.

154
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,440
Take care.

155
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,040
Don’t bother to see us off.

156
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,120
Take care.

157
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,080
Be careful.

158
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,040
Fang, have a cup of tea.

159
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,040
Take a rest if you’re tired.

160
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,120
Don’t worry

161
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,360
about work.

162
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,600
As for the money,

163
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,520
let me manage it.

164
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,640
You really think I’m for money?

165
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,880
We’re a family.

166
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,120
A family.

167
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,880
I know.

168
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,480
It’s all my fault.

169
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,240
These years,

170
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,080
you’ve suffered a lot.

171
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,800
You and Miao

172
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,000
have suffered a lot with me.

173
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,000
You’re a yesman.

174
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,640
You’re right.

175
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,600
I’m a yesman.

176
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,480
I want to take on everything.

177
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,920
But without you,

178
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,600
I can’t do anything.

179
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,600
Sorry.

180
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,000
It’s the same as before.

181
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,720
Haoyue.

182
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,920
I came back

183
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,880
to take you away this time.

184
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,520
Mom.

185
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,360
I’m not going to leave.

186
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,000
If you go on living with him,

187
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,800
you won’t have a future.

188
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,280
In such an environment,

189
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,640
you can only become

190
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,600
a second Jiang Yi.

191
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,720
Just like this old house,

192
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,760
he won’t change.

193
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,640
Don’t hope for it.

194
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,520
I was incapable.

195
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,160
But now I’m capable

196
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,440
and I can take you away.

197
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,600
Do you want to hold up your life

198
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,400
for such a person?

199
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,760
I had a car accident when I was a kid,

200
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,800
and you never came to see me.

201
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,880
Were you also afraid
that I would hold up your life?

202
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,640
When I was in the hospital,

203
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,800
I hoped you could see me every day,

204
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,440
but you never came.

205
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,840
I thought

206
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,560
he stopped you,

207
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,640
but later I realized.

208
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,440
You are my mother.

209
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,000
If you really wanted to see me,

210
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,320
no one could stop you.

211
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,640
I know,

212
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,800
he shirked his duty as a husband,

213
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,560
and you shirked your duty as a mother.

214
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,600
But now

215
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,040
I don’t want to shirk.

216
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,720
These years,

217
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,040
I’ve had a hard time.

218
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,880
But I never regret

219
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,440
that I left.

220
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,680
I gave myself

221
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,000
a chance to make a fresh choice.

222
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,480
You should also give yourself

223
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,440
a chance to make a choice.

224
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,240
Haoyue.

225
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,240
As long as you agree to go with me,

226
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,240
I’ll make it up to you.

227
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,920
Trust me, okay?

228
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,480
Remember this?

229
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,120
You left it to me.

230
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,720
All these years it

231
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,000
has stopped at the moment you left me,

232
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,920
the moment I lost everything

233
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,360
But it doesn’t matter.

234
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,160
Now,

235
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,640
it can work again.

236
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,800
I have prepared

237
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,760
a sum of money for you

238
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,040
over the years.

239
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,200
At least

240
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,680
I gave you a chance to make a choice.

241
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,880
I never forget

242
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,360
the promise I made to you.

243

244
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,160
You are back.

245
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,040
Let go.

246
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,600
Come with me.

247
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,440
Let me go.

248
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,680
Go away with her.

249
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,600
Get away.

250
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,000
Get away.

251
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,760
You can’t help him up.

252
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,240
Even if you help him up this time,

253
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,240
can you help him up
for the rest of his life?

254
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,400
Mom,

255
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,240
is your home abroad?

256
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,960
Of course.

257
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,440
My family is there.

258
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,840
So my home is right there.

259
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,280
But my family is here.

260
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,960
Here is my home.

261
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:06,960
Stand up.

262
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,640
Good boy.

263
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,080
Good boy.

264
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,920
What are you looking at?

265
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,680
Do you still remember

266
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,160
the dessert shop
at the gate of our school?

267
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,920
After school, many parents

268
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,240
lined up

269
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,640
to buy taro balls for their children.

270
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,120
At that time,

271
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,880
I also hoped every day

272
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,560
that my mother

273
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,440
would pick me up from school

274
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,760
with a big bowl of taro balls.

275
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,680
But she never appeared.

276
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,720
I remember the first time
I ate taro balls.

277
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,360
They’re from your father.

278
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,080
He always gave you

279
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,560
the bowl with the most taro balls.

280
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,360
In my childhood, I was always

281
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,560
angry with him about it.

282
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,880
When my mother left,

283
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,680
I chased her car

284
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,160
for two blocks,

285
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,560
but she didn’t look back.

286
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,160
I should have known at that time

287
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,280
that she would never come back.

288
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,320
She left again today.

289
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,360
I thought

290
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,920
I would get upset

291
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,840
and hate her just like I did

292
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,600
when I was a child,

293
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,320
but I didn’t.

294
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,280
I looked at her

295
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,480
as if she were a stranger.

296
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,920
That’s okay.

297
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,400
I let myself go

298
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,280
and also let her go.

299
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,440
Mr. Jiang.

300
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,600
You have had a hard day today.

301
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,440
I’m very lucky

302
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,600
to meet you.

303
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,080
You scared me!

304
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,240
I’m sorry.

305
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,600
Why are you sitting here?

306
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,040
It’s cool here.

307
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,160
I see.

308
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,240
You’re afraid to disturb Jiang at home.

309
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,280
I’m sorry

310
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,280
to hit you last time.

311
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,280
You were also badly hurt.

312
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:05,880
Don’t mention it.

313
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:06,960
No.

314
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,480
Come on.

315
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,520
Let’s make it clear.

316
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,480
To be exact,

317
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,760
I beat you up.

318
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,240
Look at you.

319
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,820
What can I say to you?

320
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,340
You’re more nice than wise.

321
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,000
Really!

322
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:29,580
Ziye.

323
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,300
Ziye.

324
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,360
You came here to give me water.

325
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,640
It’s my…

326
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,320
Ziye, you’ve come at the right time.

327
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,040
Let’s play it together.

328
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,360
No, I can’t.

329
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,840
Don’t go. I can teach you.

330
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,840
Right. Let’s go.

331
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,040
Do you really play basketball?

332
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,640
You didn’t make any shot.

333
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,340
How about this?

334
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,520
A great shot, right?

335
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,640
There’s no defense.

336
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,000
It’s very normal to shoot a basket.

337
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,000
You talk as if you can.

338
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,920
Come on.

339
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,880
Now you do it.

340
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,640
Yes, Ziye. Take a shot.

341
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,480
Have a try

342
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,640
since you’re here.

343
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,680
Okay, Che.

344
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,440
You teach her.

345
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,040
I’ll have a rest.

346
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,040
Hang your elbows naturally.

347
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,560
Hold the ball before your chest.

348
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,600
Look at the basket.

349
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,960
Aim at the spot on the basket.

350
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,200
Keep your feet apart.

351
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,640
Flex your knees slightly.

352
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,400
Open your hands.

353
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,400
Your palms may not touch the ball.

354
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,920
Position your right forefinger
in the middle of the ball.

355
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,920
Push the ball upward and shoot.

356
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,760
Make your hands in an inverted V-shape,

357
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,280
ensuring your vision is not blocked.

358
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,960
Attention.

359
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,920
Position your elbows, wrists,

360
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,800
and shoulders

361
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,320
so that they’re perpendicular.

362
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Are you listening to me?

363
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,720
I’m listening.

364
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,920
So that they’re perpendicular.

365
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,840
I’m listening.

366
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,240
Aim at the basket.

367
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,800
Get ready to jump.

368
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,320
Position your feet
so they’re in line with the basket.

369
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,280
Relax.

370
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,400
I’m relaxed.

371
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,680
Your wrists are stiff.

372
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,360
Three, two, one, shoot.

373
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,160
A bad shot.

374
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:52,880
Uncle.

375
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,120
I finally shot it.

376
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:56,760
Uncle.

377
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,520
Pass the ball. Thank you.

378
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,720
Uncle?

379
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,640
Little jerk.

380
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,400
I’m not that old.

381
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,200
What do you want?

382
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,880
Do you play basketball?

383
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,560
Of course.

384
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,120
What?

385
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,160
Let’s play it.

386
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:12,960
Mr. Lu.

387
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,960
Shi.

388
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,840
You know him?

389
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,200
He is Lu Miao’s classmate.

390
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,920
Are you Miao’s father?

391
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,440
- Hello, Mr. Lu.
- Hello, Mr. Lu.

392
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,200
Hello.

393
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,440
Let me introduce him.

394
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,280
You know Jiang Haoyue, right?

395
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,520
He is Jiang Haoyue’s father.

396
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,160
Scholar-tyrant’s father?

397
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,920
They don’t look like father and son.

398
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,240
Hey, boy.

399
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,640
Let’s play a game.

400
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,480
Okay?

401
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,840
Respect the old.

402
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,880
So you first.

403
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,840
Be careful.

404
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,280
I’ll show you no mercy.

405
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:47,840
Come on.

406
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,160
Come on.

407
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,320
Here.

408
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:54,960
Hey you.

409
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:56,680
Be careful.

410
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,680
Are you serious?

411
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,560
Catch the ball.

412
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,480
Pick and roll.

413
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,800
So cool.

414
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,240
Switch. Switch.

415
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,120
Good.

416
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,840
Good shot.

417
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:24,840
Well done.

418
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,160
- Che.
- How are you?

419
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,960
Are you alright?

420
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,760
I’m fine.

421
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,360
I’m going to buy some water.

422
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,160
Che.

423
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,160
How about your foot?

424
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,840
Nothing. It’s just sprained.

425
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,560
Spray some medicine and it’ll be fine.

426
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,280
Bros.

427
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,960
I underestimated you.

428
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,440
Please accept my apology.

429
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,040
He calls us bro?

430
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,360
Thank you.

431
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,200
You sure you’re alright?

432
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:47,960
Sure, I’m fine.

433
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,800
Let’s go on if you’re fine.

434
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,120
Uncle, I haven’t finished my homework.

435
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,960
My parents will be worried.

436
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,120
Go back now.

437
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,440
Uncle, bye-bye.

438
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,400
Remember to spray the medicine.

439
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,720
Hey you.

440
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,560
Thank you.

441
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,520
Jiang Yi, sit down.

442
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,400
Have you sprained your ankle?

443
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,120
No.

444
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,600
You have.

445
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,760
I just poked my toes.

446
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,360
Let’s celebrate.

447
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,920
How about buying some wine to celebrate?

448
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,040
No, I’m on the wagon.

449
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,600
Just drink this.

450
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,000
You’ve changed a lot.

451
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,400
You quit drinking.

452
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,680
I’ve been a jerk

453
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,000
most of my life.

454
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,120
I’ve got used to it

455
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,960
and become numb.

456
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,160
But Haoyue decided not to leave.

457
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,240
He said he wanted to stay with me.

458
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,480
He told his mother

459
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,960
that

460
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,880
I’m not his burden.

461
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,480
I just realized

462
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,920
how much I owed him

463
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,960
over the years.

464
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,320
I’m trying to

465
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,600
be a qualified father.

466
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,360
I closed the mahjong parlor.

467
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,400
I want to do some decent business.

468
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,360
I may not succeed,

469
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,280
but I want to give it a try.

470
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,160
It’s not too late now.

471
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,480
Get your hand off.

472
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,400
No way.

473
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,200
Che, what have you had lately?

474
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,760
Are you gaining weight?

475
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,160
You’re too heavy!

476
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,040
I don’t think so.

477
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,080
Oh, you’re putting
all your weight on me.

478
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,680
Are you a man?

479
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,480
Ziye is as thin

480
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,840
as a stick.

481
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,800
What if I hurt her?

482
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,360
What are you saying?

483
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:36,880
Are you okay?

484
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,600
It hurts.

485
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,520
I just give a kick softly.

486
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,560
It’s OK. I’m just kidding.

487
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,360
Childish!

488
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,160
Ziye.

489
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,880
Do you think

490
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,480
I lost face on the basketball court?

491
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,800
To be honest, I think so.

492
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,600
You lost face indeed,

493
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,440
but you’re cute.

494
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,120
Why are you so happy
after losing the game?

495
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:12,800
None of your business.

496
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,920
Hos before bros.

497
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,200
Who are you talking about?

498
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:17,760
You.

499
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,800
Chen Guoguo, come back.

500
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:21,640
Come back.

501
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,640
Come on. Come on.

502
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,080
Come here.

503
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,640
Now you know how heavy he is.

504
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,400
So heavy.

505
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,440
Enough!

506
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,280
Haoyue.

507
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,320
Ms. Fang.

508
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,320
You’ve been busy lately, haven’t you?

509
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,240
I’ll take the college
entrance exam next week.

510
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,640
So I’ve been studying
at school in the evening.

511
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,920
It must be very hard.

512
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,320
You…

513
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,680
These are…

514
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,520
Are you going to have these for dinner?

515
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,760
Don’t eat these anymore.

516
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,840
Come home with me for dinner.

517
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,680
It’s convenient.

518
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,760
Thank you, Ms. Fang.

519
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,520
You’re welcome.

520
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,480
Let’s go home for dinner.

521
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,560
Dinner will be ready soon.

522
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,800
The soup is almost done.

523
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,240
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

524
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,800
Hello.

525
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,640
You’re back.

526
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,400
We came back just in time.

527
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,000
Jiang Haoyue.

528
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:36,560
Jiang Haoyue.

529
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,360
Why are you here?

530
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,320
There’s a special guest.

531
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,760
Put it down.

532
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,640
Haoyue.

533
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,200
Sit down.

534
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,440
Try the chicken soup I made.

535
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,320
Here, put it in the middle.

536
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:00,740
Haoyue.

537
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,640
Put it in the middle.

538
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,400
Come on.

539
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,280
Have a taste.

540
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,280
Jiang.

541
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,960
It will be tastier than your aunt’s.

542
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,800
I met Jiang downstairs.

543
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,440
Look at these.

544
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,880
Instant noodles and snacks.

545
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,080
These are his dinner.

546
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,600
Parents pay high attention to

547
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,440
their children in the third grade.

548
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,400
But look at your family.

549
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,480
It’s quite different.

550
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,880
Stop it.

551
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,520
Mrs. Lu.

552
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,080
You’re right.

553
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,160
I’m…

554
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,560
I am a jerk.

555
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:37,960
Here.

556
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,160
Eat soup.

557
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,520
Here you are.

558
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,600
Eat this, Haoyue.

559
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:00,760
Thank you, Ms. Fang.

560
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,040
You need more nutrition.

561
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:11,760
I want to eat it too.

562
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:14,920
Look at you.

563
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,440
These are for Haoyue.

564
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,360
He is in the third grade now.

565
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,320
It’s okay. I can’t finish them.
Here you are.

566
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,680
Yes.

567
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,240
I’m afraid he can’t finish them,

568
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:23,960
so I want to eat.

569
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,320
Look, Haoyue is so sensible.

570
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,680
Have one.

571
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,440
- Thank you.
- Eat.

572
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,120
Thank you.

573
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,560
Take your time.

574
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:27,020
No.1 Middle School

575
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,640
Jiang Haoyue is awesome.

576
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,840
He really is.

577
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,160
He’s the top scorer in the province.

578
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,620
Congratulations to Jiang Haoyue

579
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,900
on being the top scorer in the province
with a total score of 702

580
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,360
Students and parents,

581
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,520
please go to the computer room

582
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,280
to apply for the college.

583
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,560
Class 1, Grade 3

584
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,320
Haoyue.

585
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:53,960
Sorry.

586
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,120
Why are you here?

587
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,240
Have you applied yet?

588
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,520
What major did you apply for?

589
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,400
Astrophysics.

590
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,840
Astrophysics.

591
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,560
It’s an unpopular major.

592
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,200
Your score is so good

593
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,280
that it’s worthless

594
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,560
to apply for an unpopular major.

595
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,600
As long as I like it.

596
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,480
I also said that when I was young.

597
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,160
But look at me now.

598
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:42,760
What a loser

599
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,160
I am!

600
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,960
You should be realistic.

601
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,800
You can’t live on your hobby.

602
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,840
The purpose of going to college

603
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,160
is to find a good job in the future,

604
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,200
right?

605
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,880
I just don’t want you to be like me.

606
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,600
I had no decent job.

607
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,480
People around me looked down on me.

608
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,760
Even my wife left with another man.

609
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,400
Dad.

610
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,200
Do you regret

611
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:30,880
liking my mother?

612
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:37,880
No, I don’t.

613
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,720
Neither do I.

614
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,080
I don’t regret

615
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,320
all my decisions.

616

617
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,080
Goodbye.

618
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,000
Goodbye.

619
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,640
She came to say goodbye to me.

620
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,120
Seize this opportunity. Come on!

621
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,160
Excuse me,

622
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,360
may I borrow your pen?

623
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:58,600
Okay.

624
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,480
Senior,

625
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:17,960
this is my WeChat ID.

626
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:19,800
We

627
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:21,960
don’t say goodbye.

628
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,880
What

629
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,840
do you want?

630
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,320
Oh no.

631
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,680
How could I

632
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,840
say such a thing out?

633
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,120
I know.

634
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,360
Gorgeous girls

635
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,360
are usually proud.

636
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,600
You just

637
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,840
waved goodbye

638
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,080
to me.

639
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,400
I think you misunderstood.

640
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,400
I just said goodbye to our school.

641
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,160
But at the milk tea shop,

642
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,240
you were afraid I’d cut my hand,

643
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,280
so you offered me tissues.

644
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,200
During the sports meeting,

645
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,520
you specially came to cheer me on.

646
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,560
Come on!

647
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,360
Did I do that?

648
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,920
I’m sorry.

649
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,880
I don’t remember.

650
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,560
You’ve been fooled.

651
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,560
Actually it’s a game of truth or dare.

652
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,120
You don’t see it, do you?

653
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,000
Well,

654
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,760
I’m done. I have to go.

655
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,400
Happy graduation.

656
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,560
I’m done. Goodbye.

657
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,560
Don’t bother me.

658
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,480
Why do you pretend you don’t know me?

659
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:51,960
Just now,

660
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:52,760
someone told you he likes you?

661
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,040
It’s just a game.

662
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,280
Let’s go.

663
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,640
Just one luggage?

664
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,120
Is it enough?

665
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,680
He carries so few things.

666
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,600
He can buy there
if he’s short of something.

667
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,400
It’s troublesome

668
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,440
to carry too many things.

669
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,520
You’re more prodigal than I am.

670
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,760
Why hasn’t he come down yet?

671
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,120
Jiang Haoyue.

672
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,040
You have so many study materials.

673
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,200
That’s a good note.

674
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,280
It’s sure to sell for a good price.

675
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,440
You want to sell it?

676
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,240
I’m just kidding.

677
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,320
I’ll make good use of such a good thing.

678
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,000
Don’t worry.

679
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,840
I’ll take good care of

680
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,000
your notebook.

681
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,240
I’m really worried about you.

682
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,520
You can leave without worry.

683
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:07,640
We’ll

684
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,080
be apart for so long for the first time.

685
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,520
Don’t worry.

686
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,760
Just go to college.

687
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,440
I’ll catch up with you soon.

688
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,360
But you

689
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,360
will go to a strange place alone.

690
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,800
I don’t know if you’ll get used to it.

691
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,280
Oh well.

692
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,240
If your new classmates

693
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,280
bully you,

694
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:33,840
tell me

695
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,200
and I’ll teach them a lesson.

696
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,680
Alright. I’ll wait for you.

697
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,240
Okay.

698
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,960
Give me your phone.

699
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,560
Phone?

700
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,800
Let’s study hard and meet at the top.

701
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,000
Bye-bye.

702
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,800
Mr. Jiang, bye-bye.

703
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,400
Bye-bye.

704
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,040
Mr. Jiang, bye-bye.

705
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,160
Mom, just one night.

706
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,360
I’ll stay for one night.

707
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,280
I’ll give you a reward, okay?

708
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,440
- No.
- I’ll give a reward to you.

709
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,240
The cartoon I saw just now

710
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,480
is terrible.

711
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,920
I dare not sleep alone.

712
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:34,880
I’ll sleep with you.

713
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,800
No, you’ll hit me if I move around.

714
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,240
I won’t.

715
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:38,960
Bye-bye.

716
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:39,520
Say bye-bye to Haoyue.

717
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:40,600
Let’s go.

718
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,400
Just one night.

719
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,560
If you two stay together,

720
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,840
you won’t sleep tonight.

721
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,320
You’re the best mom.

722
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,040
You’re the most beautiful mom.

723
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:47,760
I’ll give you a reward.

724
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,680
No, just one night.

725
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,520
Let’s go.

726
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,080
Coming.

727
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,760
Auntie, let me stay with Miao.

728
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,400
Haoyue.
