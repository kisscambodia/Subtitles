Episode 21

30
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,940
The End of Universe Is Chocolate

31
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,420
Hey, where’s Lu Miao?

32
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,840
Meng is now a loner.

33
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,280
She doesn’t speak,

34
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,600
doesn’t go to the milk tea store
and the book store.

35
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,280
Looks like Miao’s changed.

36
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,680
She’s really in a hard time.

37
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,040
Her grandpa’s sick,

38
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,360
her parents are divorcing

39
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,640
and Jiang Haoyue is leaving.

40
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,320
She must be heartbroken.

41
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,040
Is Jiang Haoyue so important to her?

42
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,280
You’ve gone through plenty.

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,760
Jiang Haoyue is very important to her,

44
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,400
don’t you know?

45
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,600
So we’ve got to do something.

46
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,720
Yeah, we can’t just watch.

47
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,600
We’ve got to do something.

48
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,560
Can you prevent her parents
from divorcing?

49
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,680
Prevent her grandpa from being sick?

50
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,520
And prevent Jiang Haoyue from leaving?

51
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,440
What’re you thinking about?

52
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,440
Preventing Jiang Haoyue from leaving.

53
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,600
Don’t do anything stupid.

54
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,580
Well, Che,

55
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,660
calm down.

56
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,720
I’ve decided.

57
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,760
I’d do anything for Meng.

58
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,080
What’s it?

59
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,160
Why are you leaving?

60
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,720
Why?

61
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,160
You want me to stay?

62
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,840
I want you to leave,

63
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,520
as far as you could.

64
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,920
But Lu Miao wants you to stay.

65
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,880
Have you thought of her?

66
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,080
She cares about you,

67
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,960
and you’re leaving at this moment.

68
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,920
I wish her to live well.

69
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,000
So stay if you do!

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,680
Can’t believe what you are thinking.

71
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,960
A studious idiot, hah?

72
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,960
I leave so she could live well.

73
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,960
I leave so she could live well.

74
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,960
The second role in a soap opera, hah?

75
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,040
What are my lines?

76
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,200
Lu Miao is mine
and I’ll take good care of her.

77
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,120
Dose Lu Miao adore me?

78
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,780
Morocco

79
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,320
Che, why do you make
so many paper planes?

80
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:51,880
Confession.

81
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,440
What?

82
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,800
Again?

83
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,200
Not again.

84
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,280
It never worked.

85
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,080
Is it where you fell down

86
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,440
where you lie down?

87
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,280
It’s different.

88
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,640
Yeah, it is. You got me in.

89
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,360
And the result will be the same.

90
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,880
The result

91
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,440
doesn’t matter.

92
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,720
What do you mean?

93
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,400
Jiang Haoyue is going abroad.

94
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,760
And you’ll have an opportunity?

95
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,120
I have a plan.

96
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,680
Jiang Haoyue is leaving

97
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,480
and I’m happy.

98
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,160
But I want Meng to be happy, too.

99
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,320
So I’ll make him stay for her.

100
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,800
I appreciate your attempt.

101
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,440
But do you believe Jiang Haoyue

102
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,240
will stay because of

103
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,480
your confession?

104
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,680
If I were him, I would.

105
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,040
If I were a girl I’d make you my man.

106
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,120
I’d not make you mine.

107
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,240
Miao, is that bad?

108
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,240
Tell me, what’s the matter?

109
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,520
I planned to say goodbye
to Jiang Haoyue,

110
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,320
but I cowered before him.

111
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,720
It looked like

112
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,720
I was not ready to say goodbye.

113
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,960
Growing up is a course
of losing and saying goodbye.

114
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,520
When I was your age,

115
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,880
I was not as brave as you are.

116
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,640
So how did you

117
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,480
become braver and braver?

118
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,080
Am I brave?

119
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,080
To me,

120
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,560
you’re the bravest man in the world.

121
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,800
My bravery is in my trunk.

122
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,400
Miao, take the pump, please.

123
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,400
Look what I’ve got.

124
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,760
What is that?

125
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,000
Miao, this is a water rocket.

126
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,080
Where did you buy it?

127
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,200
Buy?

128
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,800
When I was young,

129
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,440
we couldn’t afford toys.

130
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,720
We made our toys. Awesome?

131
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,100
Come, Miao,

132
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,100
put water in it.

133
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,280
When I was unhappy as a kid,

134
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,960
I’d come to the sea

135
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,640
with the water rocket,

136
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,120
whoosh, I fired it away.

137
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,440
All the unhappiness was gone to the sky.

138
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,400
Now write your unhappiness

139
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,000
on the water rocket.

140
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,380
Jiang Haoyue, goodbye

141
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,680
Dad, your turn.

142
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,320
It’s my turn.

143
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,100
Fang comes home

144
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,240
Done.

145
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,080
Let’s blow it up.

146
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,720
Come, Miao,

147
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,840
hold my arm.

148
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,040
Let us

149
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,560
fire our unhappiness to the sky.

150
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,760
One, two, three.

151
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,640
Dad, you’ve got water on your face.

152
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,740
Go, go, go.

153
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,280
She’s coming.

154
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,040
She’s coming.

155
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,240
Ready?

156
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,320
Three, two, one.

157
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,580
Look up there!

158
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,760
Planes! Many of them!

159
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,200
Lu Miao,

160
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,280
do you know how many

161
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,080
countries there are in this world?

162
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,360
One hundred and ninety-five.

163
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,760
I don’t know how to make you happy.

164
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,800
I’ve made you flights

165
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,040
to every one of them.

166
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,960
Don’t be afraid to start.

167
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,720
I promise,

168
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,880
wherever the destination is,

169
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,320
it’ll be the most beautiful trip.

170
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,560
I’m going to Morocco!

171
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,400
I’m going to France!

172
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,200
I’m going to Mauritius!

173
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,440
This is not an unrealistic dream.

174
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,600
This is our future.

175
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:30,960
Lu Miao,

176
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,760
I adore…

177
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,400
What did you say?

178
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,280
I didn’t hear it!

179
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,560
Wait up there!

180
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,000
I’m going to you.

181
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,240
No way!

182
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,280
Again?

183
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:47,920
Out of power?

184
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,680
I must do the confession!

185
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,740
Switzerland

186
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,600
Go, Go, back to class.

187
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,480
Che,

188
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,760
what are you doing?

189
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,800
Lu Miao, I adore you.

190
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,320
I’m not

191
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,040
the victim of your prank.

192
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,960
Come on, let’s go.

193
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,640
I adore you.

194
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,880
Do you adore me?

195
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:15,960
Sorry,

196
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,320
I adore someone else.

197
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,040
I’m sorry.

198
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,520
Got you there, victim.

199
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,360
Wish you’ve seen your face,

200
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:35,800
yeah.

201
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:37,960
Sorry,

202
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,240
I adore someone else.

203
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,080
I adore someone else.

204
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,040
Is that funny?

205
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:45,920
No…

206
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,560
Dare you do it again?

207
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,960
No…

208
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,880
Shi Che, stop!

209
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,760
Stop!

210
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,360
What do you mean?

211
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,520
What do you mean!

212
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,200
Packing up?

213
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,560
In your dreams.

214
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,960
You’ll not take

215
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,560
anything from the house.

216
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,080
Wow, that’s good!

217
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,120
Time Book

218
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,180
Are you sure that was a prank?

219
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:47,200
Are you sure that was a prank?

220
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,480
A prank has a reason.

221
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,680
But a guy like Che,

222
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,840
I’m not sure.

223
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,240
I’d tell you the truth.

224
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,760
He always adores you.

225
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:04,880
He adores you

226
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,520
and envies Jiang Haoyue.

227
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,200
The confession at the school games,

228
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,480
he wrote it to you.

229
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,280
It can’t be!

230
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,560
I know it, and Guoguo does, too.

231
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,880
He doesn’t allow us to tell you.

232
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,720
He hopes you will

233
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,120
feel his heart.

234
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,720
I just tugged his armpit.

235
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,000
So,

236
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,480
any idea about
how to get along with him?

237
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,480
He said it was a prank

238
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,840
and you believe it was a prank?

239
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,880
If the one I adore doesn’t adore me,

240
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,520
pretending nothing happened,

241
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,600
and making fun of me every day,

242
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,600
it’s killing me.

243
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,040
I’d better avoid him.

244
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,320
Qu Wei got a full mark.

245
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,000
Did you confess to him?

246
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,560
Confess?

247
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,280
Didn’t you promise that

248
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,760
you’ll confess to him
if he gets a full mark?

249
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,240
Checking the assessment result.

250
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:31,960
Yeah.

251
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,800
I was busy with the exams.

252
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,640
I’ll check it later.

253
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,360
I envy you.

254
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,440
I wish I could

255
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:44,860
control my mood

256
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,720
Switzerland
control my mood

257
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,060
like doing math.

258
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:47,880
like doing math.

259
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,640
Wake up, Xie Ziye,

260
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,680
you’re dating a full-mark guy.

261
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,240
Ziye.

262
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,600
Wei.

263
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,920
You want a talk with me?

264
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,400
For me?

265
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,560
Emm.

266
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,080
Thank you.

267
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,040
This is a confession gift.

268
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:58,800
Confession?

269
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,600
Too sudden.

270
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,880
Not at all.

271
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,080
Since grade one,

272
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,400
I’ve been assessing every boy

273
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,640
I meet.

274
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,480
Wei, you top my list.

275
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,240
You fit my criteria best.

276
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,380
Jiang Haoyue 96 Qu Wei 100

277
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,560
Didn’t expect I win over Jiang Haoyue

278
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,160
in your system.

279
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,160
Wei,

280
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,960
is my confession accepted?

281
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,400
Sorry, it’s not.

282
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,280
Why?

283
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,040
Wei, doesn’t the system

284
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,520
prove

285
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,640
I fit your criteria best?

286
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,480
But I didn’t feel

287
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,880
you adore me.

288
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,140
Well, Wei,

289
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,880
you’re good at chemistry

290
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,840
and you should know

291
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,080
adoring is a reaction of substances.

292
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,440
At first-sight or coming in time,

293
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,560
as long as your brain

294
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,080
produces enough phenethylamine,

295
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,240
you’ll feel you adore someone.

296
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,760
Love is indeed chemistry,

297
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,200
but in the right sequence.

298
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,480
You meet someone you adore first,

299
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,080
then you produce phenethylamine.

300
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,040
Phenethylamine doesn’t decide

301
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,360
who you’ll adore.

302
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,920
Ziye, don’t despair.

303
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,920
Use your heart to feel the chemistry.

304
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,360
Thank you.

If you don’t, stay. Tell me.

I’ll talk with Chen Lu.

So stay if you do!

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,480
Can’t believe what you are thinking.

I leave so she could live well.

320

Dose Lu Miao adore me?

321
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,920
Lu Miao is mine
and I’ll take good care of her.

322
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,000
Are you sleeping here?

323
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,560
Leave me alone.

324
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,400
My heart’s broken.

325
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,800
Fix it then.

326
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,560
You’ve helped me, anyway.

327
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,360
Shouldn’t you

328
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,280
say something to comfort me?

329
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,320
I said you have no hope,

330
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,040
and you…

331
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,320
Are you crying again?

332
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,080
I knew it from the beginning.

333
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,720
But it still hurts.

334
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,400
I got it.

335
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,760
I know something
that can heal your sadness.

336
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,440
What’s it?

337
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,040
I’m afraid you dare not to try.

338
00:24:59,120 --> 00:24:59,960
Hey,

339
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,600
Shi Che

340
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,280
dares to do anything in this world.

341
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,960
Are you afraid?

342
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,000
Hey,

00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,080
Shi Che is not afraid.

00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,040
It’s fine. It’s about the fifth floor.

Fifth floor? Let me go!

I’ve identified my No. 1.

392
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,720
I confessed to him,

393
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,520
but was declined.

394
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,920
Why?

395
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,040
He said

396
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,760
fit doesn’t mean adoring.

397
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,600
Adoring

398
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,720
is from the bottom of your heart.

399
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,000

It’s fine.

403
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,440
You did nothing wrong.

404
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,120
Adoring is sort of

405
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,200
a lucky draw.

406
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,240
Sometime

407
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,760
you meet someone similar to you.

408
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,560
But most of us are unlucky.

409
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,720
But someday you’ll

410
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,160
meet someone who truly adores you.

411
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,480
When that day comes,

412
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,200
you’ll be truly happy

413
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,080
for meeting the one.

414
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,200
You will.

415
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,960
I’m truly happy today.

416
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,160
I was a bit scared,

417
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,560
but I’m very happy.

418
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,880
After you.

419
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,200
It’s so nice of you, Meng.

420
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,200
No…

421
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,160
Still mad at my prank?

422
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,960
I admit.

423
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,240
You take me as a brother
but I tried to woo you.

424
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,640
It was definitely my bad.

425
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,040
But you have a generous heart.

426
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,800
And I’ve decided not to adore you.

427
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,480
Let’s turn to a new page.

428
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,040
It’s a lifelong brotherhood.

429
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,440
A lifelong brotherhood?

430
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,320
Or, sisterhood?

431
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,280
Great, a lifelong brotherhood.

432
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,600
Take anything you want. It’s on me.

433
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,180
Come on.

434
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:42,780
Okay.

435
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,920
Thanks, Meng, for the treat.

436
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,360
It’s fine. I hit you.

437
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,640
This is for your armpit.

438
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,440
It didn’t hurt.

439
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,280
Excuse me.

440
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,280
Jiang Haoyue, we need a talk.

441
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,880
I yelled at you.

442
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,000
I failed to control my emotion.

443
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,600
I’m sorry.

444
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,960
I’m the one who should say sorry.

445
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,760
I shouldn’t leave you at this moment.

446
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,200
Nonsense.

447
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,080
You have a future.

448
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,960
You wanna go somewhere far and better.

449
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,640
It’s natural.

450
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,520
I’m your childhood friend

451
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,960
and I should support you.

452
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,600
I made this with my own hands.

453
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,960
You must wear it. An amulet.

454
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,320
That was all I wanted to say.

455
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,040
Goodbye.

456
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,100
Take You To The End Of The World

457
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,600
My life would be like this,

458
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,800
going to school alone.

459
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,560
It’s not bad, anyway.

460
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,960
Nobody tells me not
to eat too many snacks.

461
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,680
I’ll eat as much as I could.

462
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,880
Nobody pushes me to do my homework.

463
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,920
Freedom!

464
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,200
I’ll not be afraid of

465
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,400
failing exams and disgracing him.

466
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,000
I’ll be happier than I was.

467
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,480
Cheers!

468
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,160
Is this Jiang Haoyue’s laptop?

469
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,440
Checking it out

470
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,480
is not infringement of privacy.

471
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,800
And I don’t really want to.

Jiang Haoyue was sending it to me?

474
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,480
I thought we’d lead
the college of science,

475
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,920
but you’ve changed the track.

476
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,280
I’d be bored if you go.

477
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,760
You’ll get used to it in 21 days.

478
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,400
That’s coldblooded.

479
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,520
Did Lu Miao hear the same thing?

480
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,080
She was quiet, and she understands.

481
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,120
That’s fine.

482
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,280
Or you’ll feel guilty.

483
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,400
I shouldn’t leave you at this moment.

484
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,720
You have a future.

485
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,720

You must wear it.

491
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,760
An amulet.

492
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,480
I’m starting to regret.

493
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:13,920
Where are you going?

494
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:14,680
Dike!

495
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,200
It’s April 18, 2018,

496
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,120
eight years since

497
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,920
we first met.

498
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,240
When we were little,

499
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,440
I actually hated

500
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,560
you stuck to me every day.

501
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,000
Jiang Haoyue, nice to meet you.

502
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,720
I’m Lu Miao.

503
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,150
You may call me Miao.

504
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:41,720
You may call me Miao.

505
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,880
Now you have a sister.

506
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,560
She’s me.

507
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:45,450
Jiang Haoyue, don’t go.

508
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:46,880
Jiang Haoyue.

509
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,175
You’re now Terminator No. 2.

510
00:37:49,175 --> 00:37:49,240
You’re now Terminator No. 2.

511
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:49,825
And I’m No. 1.

512
00:37:49,825 --> 00:37:50,520
And I’m No. 1.

513
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,840
You’re terminated by me.

514
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,400
I don’t know when it started.

515
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,560
I got used to it

516
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:58,950
that you waited for me in the games.

517
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:01,320
that you waited for me in the games.

518
