Pulse is normal.

12

Pupils look normal.

13
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:11,465
Ms. Kim?

14
00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:14,843
If you can hear me, please blink.

15
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,728
Do you recognize your husband?

16
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:25,896
Soo Jin...

17
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:53,675
You’ll get better soon.

19
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,691
What?

20
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:13,578
So I’m not the only child
of a mogul.

21
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:15,205
But an orphan?

22
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,613
That’s sad.

23
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:17,415
NO SIBLINGS

24
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,533
NO SIBLINGS
But I was always by your side.

25
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,411
When did you first tell me
you love me?

26
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,166
I couldn’t.

27
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,878
Not at the wedding
or even before.

28
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,630
Why not?

29
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:36,591
You’ll see...

30
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,836
I’m scared.

31
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:16,758
What if I meet someone
who knows me?

32
00:04:18,718 --> 00:04:20,553
We practiced many times.

33
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,263
Let’s try it again.

34
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,306
If it’s a woman...

35
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,441
“Oh, my!”

36
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:27,026
“Long time no see!”

37
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:29,353
“You got prettier!
I didn’t recognize you!”

38
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,438
If it’s a man?

39
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:33,441
“Who are you?”

40
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,126
BIG SALE ON UNSOLD UNITS!

41
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:03,680
We’re here.

42
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,945
We have a big load.

43
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:23,281
I’ll take some up first.
Stay here.

44
00:05:23,575 --> 00:05:25,451
I’ll be right back.

45
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:47,056
Ground floor.

46
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:50,560
Tenth floor.

47
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,436
Going up.

48
00:06:02,113 --> 00:06:03,113
Help!

49
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,453
Help...

50
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,330
Is anyone there?

51
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:14,791
What the?

52
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:18,588
Help me...

53
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,438
Soo Jin!

54
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:36,740
Wake up!

55
00:06:36,815 --> 00:06:38,106
What’s wrong?

56
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
Soo Jin!

57
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:47,533
Are you okay?

58
00:06:48,493 --> 00:06:49,410
What happened?

59
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,495
The power went out.

60
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,540
You hate being in the dark.

61
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,168
Let’s go back to the hospital
tomorrow.

62
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,021
What’s that?

63
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,400
Today’s May 10th.

64
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:24,403
The day you came home.

65
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:26,823
It’s all melted.

66
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,343
Remember?

67
00:07:48,595 --> 00:07:51,430
From what you told me,
is that Canada?

68
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,391
Yup.

69
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:58,020
Who suggested emigrating
to Canada first?

70
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,568
Well, let’s see.

71
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:06,570
You suggested going first.

72
00:08:09,073 --> 00:08:11,533
So I made preparations.

73
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,790
I want to hear more.

74
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:17,998
Well,

75
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:22,670
Vermillion Lake is reddish orange.

76
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:29,510
When the sunset reflects off the lake,
everything is stained red.

77
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:34,056
When winds blow down
the mountains to the lake,

78
00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:38,478
they say it sounds like
someone’s singing.

79
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,245
Next, please.

80
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,330
Coming.

81
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,711
Even if you can immigrate,
your work experience won’t count.

82
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:08,758
Are you willing
to start from the bottom?

83
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:11,510
Yes, sir. I’ll do anything.

84
00:09:11,845 --> 00:09:14,813
You bought a house
even before the screening.

85
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,516
Is there a reason
you’re rushing to immigrate?

86
00:09:18,518 --> 00:09:19,726
The reason?

87
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,453
I’m bored.
I thought I’d take a walk.

88
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:31,496
What if you get lost alone?

89
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,656
See you later.

90
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:33,950
Going down.

91
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,493
Soo Jin!

92
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,001
Third floor.

93
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:47,630
Going down.

94
00:09:49,215 --> 00:09:50,050
Hi.

95
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,981
No!

96
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:48,400
No!

97
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:08,886
What did the doctor say?

98
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:10,596
To stay in the hospital, right?

99
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,806
But you insisted on
being discharged.

100
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,185
You’re not well!
You have to be careful.

101
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,261
If you don’t listen,

102
00:11:17,595 --> 00:11:20,723
I’ll make you stay in the hospital
until we move to Canada.

103
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:23,308
You’re hurt worse than me.

104
00:11:23,893 --> 00:11:25,361
- Sit here.
- What?

105
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:26,278
Sit down.

106
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,063
- I’m fine.
- Come on!

107
00:11:33,528 --> 00:11:34,695
It’s okay.

108
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:41,285
Why’d you do that back then?

109
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,246
I...

110
00:11:45,665 --> 00:11:46,665
Wait.

111
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,461
You didn’t take your pills.

112
00:12:05,685 --> 00:12:07,945
They’ve prescribed
what’s good for you.

113
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,146
Take them.

114
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:42,688
DREAM TOWN PROJECT – CANCELLED

115
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,190
DREAM TOWN PROJECT – CANCELLED
See over there?

116
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:45,441
DREAM TOWN PROJECT – CANCELLED
They cut the CCTV
and took the copper pipes.

117
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:47,610
They cut the CCTV
and took the copper pipes.

118
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:50,271
They stole this and this too.

119
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:55,151
I was at a nearby pub
and came back to check.

120
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:57,778
The materials were gone by then.

121
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:01,115
You said this place
will be demolished soon?

122
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,708
Yes.

123
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:05,078
-That’s why I came to...
-At night?

124
00:13:05,495 --> 00:13:06,871
You work really hard.

125
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:08,706
What?

126
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:14,045
You came back at 1AM to check?

127
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:16,681
Did you hide gold here or something?

128
00:13:16,756 --> 00:13:18,725
I already told you, detective.

129
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,511
The owner was coming
to inspect.

130
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:24,605
What are you implying?

131
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,765
Please, sir.

132
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:27,983
I apologize.

133
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:30,195
Please send us the list of
missing materials.

134
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,311
Names of all workers.

135
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:32,813
The workers’ list too.

136
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:33,990
Subcontractors too.

137
00:13:34,065 --> 00:13:35,650
Subcontractors too, please.

138
00:13:40,113 --> 00:13:41,613
Kim Soo Jin.

139
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,075
Housewife.

140
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:19,360
Kid!

141
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,411
Going up.

142
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,420
It’s you!

143
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,130
At the crosswalk yesterday...

144
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,965
Were you hurt?

145
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:45,886
Did you go and see a doctor?

146
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:48,856
Third floor.

147
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:49,931
Wait...

148
00:14:50,683 --> 00:14:52,226
My princess is back.

149
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:02,278
Mommy! I’m hungry!

150
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,783
My princess is back.

151
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,993
- Had fun at school?
- Yes!

152
00:15:10,161 --> 00:15:12,288
SAMJEONG ARCHITECTS

153
00:15:26,928 --> 00:15:27,603
Hello?

154
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:29,555
Can you come now?

155
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:32,016
I know this sounds crazy.

156
00:15:32,475 --> 00:15:33,735
But just in case...

157
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,478
I have to do something.

158
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:45,780
No!

159
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,663
I saw it happen.

160
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,958
I know it sounds weird.

161
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:58,418
It’s crazy.

162
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,378
Though it’s very rare,

163
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:05,308
there are cases of hallucinations
due to cerebral cortex damage.

164
00:16:05,383 --> 00:16:07,093
Due to your brain injury,

165
00:16:07,385 --> 00:16:09,020
you may think you saw the future.

166
00:16:09,095 --> 00:16:10,146
But I did...

167
00:16:10,221 --> 00:16:11,313
Soo Jin.

168
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:12,648
Stop it, please?

169
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:14,975
She could misconceive things.

170
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,480
Like you’ve seen
or heard them before.

171
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:21,106
They call it déjà vu.

172
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:23,191
It’s like a delusion.

173
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:30,366
No matter what I say,
you think I’m crazy.

174
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,371
Soo Jin! Wait!

175
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:37,665
I’m sorry.

176
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:38,958
Soo Jin!

177
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,920
Don’t go like that.

178
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:44,171
The third-floor kid.

179
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:45,548
What?

180
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:47,508
The third-floor girl is alive!

181
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:53,640
Even if what you say is true,
it doesn’t concern you.

182
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:55,900
But the girl almost died.

183
00:16:55,975 --> 00:16:57,935
What if I could stop it?

184
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,313
You said she’s fine.

185
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:03,858
Where is she?

186
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:05,485
They’re gone!

187
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,661
I just saw them.

188
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:08,988
That’s enough!

189
00:17:10,823 --> 00:17:12,491
You’re not okay!

190
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:23,795
Right.

191
00:17:25,255 --> 00:17:26,630
I’m not okay.

192
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:28,925
Soo Jin.

193
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:31,853
Wait.

194
00:17:31,928 --> 00:17:34,055
Let’s go. I need some air.

195
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:07,588
I overreacted earlier.

196
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:10,300
I’m sorry.

197
00:18:12,343 --> 00:18:14,220
I should only say good things...

198
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,603
Do I know how to swim?

199
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:25,440
- Swim?
- Yes.

200
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:29,276
Well...

201
00:18:32,071 --> 00:18:34,198
- Let’s try and see.
- Now?

202
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:35,491
Here?

203
00:18:38,411 --> 00:18:39,211
Wait!

204
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:40,330
It’s cold.

205
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:44,208
The water is still too cold!

206
00:18:45,251 --> 00:18:46,670
I think it’ll be warm.

207
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:51,548
Soo Jin.

208
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,926
It’s cold. Stop going in!

209
00:18:55,803 --> 00:18:57,346
Let’s go back!

210
00:18:58,556 --> 00:19:00,816
It’s dangerous.
Come on. Let’s go back.

211
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:01,935
I like it.

212
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:07,573
Are you okay?

213
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:10,276
Guess I couldn’t swim.
I’m scared.

214
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:13,371
No, you loved the water.

215
00:19:13,446 --> 00:19:15,915
You liked going to the beach
every summer.

216
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,366
You love lakes too.

217
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:19,085
Now.

218
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,128
Relax.

219
00:19:20,203 --> 00:19:21,161
I’ll hold you.

220
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:24,081
Don’t let me go.

221
00:19:26,751 --> 00:19:27,876
That’s it.

222
00:19:45,311 --> 00:19:47,855
- Are you still there?
- Yup.

223
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:51,066
I’ll always be by your side.

224
00:19:52,443 --> 00:19:54,236
Even if you can’t see me.

225
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,775
HEAT IT UP BEFORE YOU EAT
DON’T FORGET YOUR PILLS

226
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:45,830
It’s the police.

227
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:48,416
We’ve received a report
from your hospital.

228
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:53,045
OPEN DOOR

229
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:57,258
It looks like a model home.

230
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,510
Pardon?

231
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:01,805
Ms. Kim.

232
00:21:02,388 --> 00:21:05,766
The report said you had bruises.

233
00:21:06,225 --> 00:21:07,226
Here.

234
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,028
It could be from the accident.

235
00:21:09,103 --> 00:21:12,898
But some could be from
before you fell.

236
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:16,076
We’re asking about your husband.

237
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:19,863
Like, if he’s abusive or violent...

238
00:21:23,368 --> 00:21:24,618
I’ll report him.

239
00:21:25,411 --> 00:21:26,411
Pardon?

240
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,375
If he is, I’ll report him.

241
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,251
You had me.

242
00:21:33,628 --> 00:21:34,628
I’m sorry.

243
00:21:35,296 --> 00:21:37,098
You went hiking together?

244
00:21:37,173 --> 00:21:38,173
Yes.

245
00:21:39,425 --> 00:21:41,970
But I heard you lost your memory.

246
00:21:43,513 --> 00:21:44,513
Sir.

247
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,600
I’m sorry.
Everything is fine, right?

248
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:48,476
Yes.

249
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:51,946
Please sign here.

250
00:21:52,021 --> 00:21:56,441
Don’t worry. It’s just a formality
for us to check on reports.

251
00:21:57,985 --> 00:21:58,986
I see.

252

254
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:15,586
KIM SOO JIN

255
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,256
Call us if you need anything.

256
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:20,508
I will.

257
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:22,385
We’ll be going.

258
00:22:29,058 --> 00:22:30,685
Isn’t it the other way?

259
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:32,270
Sorry?

260
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:34,146
Let’s go.

261
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:36,231
- We’ll be in touch.
- Bye.

262
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:54,875
Hello?

263
00:22:55,418 --> 00:22:57,753
Ji-hoon, what do you like?

264
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:00,881
Why all of a sudden?

265
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:04,343
Well, you know a lot about me,

266
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:07,346
but I don’t know anything about you.

267
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:15,730
Don’t worry.
You’ll remember everything soon.

268
00:23:25,823 --> 00:23:26,991
Ground floor.

269
00:23:30,495 --> 00:23:31,328
Going up.

270
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:35,875
Here.

271
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,920
MILITARY MAIL

272
00:23:41,965 --> 00:23:42,931
Help me!

273
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:43,841
Let go!

274
00:23:45,135 --> 00:23:46,343
Seventh floor.

275
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:57,688
No! Wait!

276
00:23:59,023 --> 00:24:01,275
Something terrible
could happen to you.

277
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:02,451
Left neck...

278
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:04,911
No, he has a scar on his chin.

279
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:07,956
In his 40s, no 50s.
The man will...

280
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:09,116
Who’s there?

281
00:24:10,076 --> 00:24:11,126
That man will...

282
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:12,453
It’s me, Dad.

283
00:24:13,621 --> 00:24:14,871
Wait...

284
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:24,150
Soo Jin!

285
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,405
Soo Jin!

286
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:30,915
It’s been a while.

287
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,658
How’ve you been?

288
00:25:35,286 --> 00:25:37,255
You got prettier,
I didn’t recognize you, ma’am.

289
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:39,498
Why are you calling me ma’am?

290
00:25:40,416 --> 00:25:42,343
Know how much
I worried about you?

291
00:25:42,418 --> 00:25:43,795
I had no way to reach you.

292
00:25:45,713 --> 00:25:47,506
Did I lose some weight?

293
00:25:50,426 --> 00:25:51,426
Really?

294
00:25:51,761 --> 00:25:53,471
You don’t remember anything?

295
00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:56,140
I can’t believe it.

296
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,435
Hello, Ms. Kim!

297
00:25:59,143 --> 00:26:00,353
It’s Chae-min.

298
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,531
You don’t remember?

299
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:07,026
You worked here for years!

300
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:10,321
I worked here, ma’am?

301
00:26:12,615 --> 00:26:14,616
Stop calling me that!

302
00:26:15,035 --> 00:26:17,328
Then saying I got prettier
was a lie?

303
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,706
You can’t remember your desk?

304
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:23,626
It’s here.

305
00:26:31,216 --> 00:26:32,968
See? Who’s this?

306
00:26:39,225 --> 00:26:40,685
Tell me again.

307
00:26:41,728 --> 00:26:44,321
You went climbing
with your husband?

308
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:47,316
His love for you is quite unique.

309
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:50,570
Did he get suspicious of you again?

310
00:26:52,155 --> 00:26:53,155
What do you mean?

311
00:26:53,781 --> 00:26:56,626
Some people lie about going
mountain climbing,

312
00:26:56,701 --> 00:26:59,911
and end up climbing
something else at motels.

313
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,416
Since you go hiking often,
he could get jealous or suspicious.

314
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:07,378
Because he’s a doting husband.

315
00:27:07,628 --> 00:27:11,131
A jealous but doting husband.

316
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,055

I’ll send your stuff by post.

319
00:27:25,521 --> 00:27:27,481
Are you sure you’re okay?

SAMJEONG ARCHITECTS

321
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:55,885
Oh, no.

322
00:27:57,053 --> 00:27:58,605
Did you lose money too?

323
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,140
You should’ve come sooner.

324
00:28:00,848 --> 00:28:03,435
It went bankrupt and closed
over 6 months ago.

325
00:28:03,685 --> 00:28:04,651
A man comes once in a while
to pick stuff up.

326
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:06,570
A man comes once in a while
to pick stuff up.

331
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:49,105
Hi.

332
00:28:50,023 --> 00:28:52,733
Where’d you go?
Why didn’t you take my calls?

333
00:28:53,776 --> 00:28:55,320
Where were you today?

334
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,573
Did you go to my office?

335
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,245
Emigrating to Canada...

336
00:29:06,205 --> 00:29:08,791
Is it because you went bankrupt?

337
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:14,963
It’s not like that.

338
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:18,468
I didn’t want to worry you.
Things are wrapping up.

339
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:21,595
I’ll take care of everything
before leaving for Canada.

340
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:24,140
By the way,

341
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:27,310
how’d you find your way
to my office?

342
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:30,688
I went to my art school.

343
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,441
Your memory...

344
00:29:35,526 --> 00:29:36,695
... is back?

345
00:29:40,115 --> 00:29:41,866
Is that a problem?

346
00:29:44,493 --> 00:29:45,995
What do you mean?

347
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:48,540
Know what I thought about all day?

348
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:51,666
You even told me
about my sleeping habits.

349
00:29:52,043 --> 00:29:54,128
But you didn’t tell me
where I worked?

350
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,756
You know I can’t remember.

351
00:29:57,006 --> 00:29:59,800
Am I really who you say I am?

352
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:02,928
I couldn’t tell you.

353
00:30:05,265 --> 00:30:06,348
Truth is...

354
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:10,186
You’re the one
who painted that.

355
00:30:16,901 --> 00:30:18,570
I didn’t lie on purpose.

356
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:20,655
Due to the accident,

357
00:30:20,905 --> 00:30:24,866
you injured your finger.
They said you may never paint again.

358
00:30:25,826 --> 00:30:27,828
I knew you’d be devastated.

359
00:30:28,913 --> 00:30:30,790
That’s why I couldn’t tell you.

360
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:34,335
I was going to tell you
when you got better.

361
00:30:43,386 --> 00:30:47,140
Thanks to you,
I don’t remember anything.

362
00:30:48,391 --> 00:30:50,393
It’s all mixed up in my head.

363
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,730
I keep seeing things.

364
00:30:55,065 --> 00:30:56,816
I can’t tell if they’re delusions

365
00:30:57,358 --> 00:30:58,985
or reality now.

366
00:31:37,231 --> 00:31:38,156
Watch, sir.

367
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:40,576
This is the only way
to the site on the 13th.

368
00:31:40,651 --> 00:31:41,443
Jeez.

369
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,905
Are you looking for
a serial killer or what?

370
00:31:46,365 --> 00:31:47,491
See that?

371
00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:49,660
It’s the chief’s truck.

372
00:31:53,246 --> 00:31:53,881
Here!

373
00:31:53,956 --> 00:31:56,333
It’s the only car
that came out of the site.

374
00:31:58,001 --> 00:32:00,055
Did you check the list
of stolen goods?

375
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:02,423
I can’t go through all of it
by myself.

376
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:05,093
Then how can they be
all on that car?

377
00:32:10,098 --> 00:32:11,556
Eat it.

378
00:32:11,975 --> 00:32:14,226
The stolen goods must’ve been sold.

379
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:17,563
Look into buyers of the goods.

380
00:32:18,606 --> 00:32:22,526
Even if sold separately,
it’s enough to catch eyes.

381
00:32:28,575 --> 00:32:29,333
Wait!

382
00:32:29,408 --> 00:32:30,451
Why?

383
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:38,876
What is it?

384
00:32:39,418 --> 00:32:40,420
It’s him.

385
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,005
Someone you know?

386
00:32:43,088 --> 00:32:44,173
Can’t remember?

387
00:32:45,008 --> 00:32:46,258
The wedding picture!

388
00:33:48,405 --> 00:33:49,738
Here you are.

389
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,460
ME
SOO JIN

390
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,718
I’m sorry.

391
00:34:55,513 --> 00:34:56,555
Not getting on?

392
00:35:08,025 --> 00:35:10,653
I’m almost home.

393
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:14,948
I raised her long enough
for her dead mom.

394
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,285
I’ll send her to a bar or something.

395
00:35:17,618 --> 00:35:19,536
She’s pretty.
Takes after her mom.

396
00:35:22,498 --> 00:35:23,583
I’ll call you back.

397
00:35:31,173 --> 00:35:32,675
Shit.

398
00:35:33,091 --> 00:35:34,718
Just my damn luck!

399
00:35:40,975 --> 00:35:42,018
Let go!

400
00:35:46,981 --> 00:35:48,315
Don’t touch the girl!

401
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:52,986
What?

402
00:35:56,573 --> 00:35:58,576
If anything happens to her,

403
00:36:00,495 --> 00:36:01,955
I’ll report you.

404
00:36:02,705 --> 00:36:03,831
Who are you?

405
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:08,001
Who the hell are you!

406
00:36:28,105 --> 00:36:29,031
Soo Jin!

407
00:36:29,106 --> 00:36:30,275
Are you okay?

408
00:36:30,941 --> 00:36:32,068
Unit 706.

409
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,280
Unit 706...

410
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,451
Preconstruction here sold
like hot cakes.

411
00:36:41,118 --> 00:36:43,371
Who knew it’d be demolished?

412
00:36:43,538 --> 00:36:45,415
Up this way, please.

413
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:49,626
Are you talking about Lee Ji-hoon?

414
00:36:49,918 --> 00:36:51,963
Yes, that’s him.

415
00:36:52,338 --> 00:36:58,218
The CEO of Samjeong,
the architect in charge.

416
00:36:58,845 --> 00:37:02,023
When this went bankrupt,

417
00:37:02,098 --> 00:37:03,983
he went into hiding from loan sharks.

418
00:37:04,058 --> 00:37:06,393
No one knows where he is.

419
00:37:06,811 --> 00:37:08,396
Jeez.

420
00:37:23,118 --> 00:37:24,378
Get back!

421
00:37:24,453 --> 00:37:25,746
Jeez!

422
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:31,085
No safety fences? Crazy!

423
00:37:34,005 --> 00:37:35,256
- Detective Bae.
- Yes?

424
00:37:35,965 --> 00:37:38,593
Didn’t that woman say
she fell while hiking?

425
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,303
- Who?
- You know.

426
00:37:41,095 --> 00:37:42,971
Right. Lee Ji-hoon’s wife.

427
00:37:43,473 --> 00:37:44,390
So...

428
00:37:45,433 --> 00:37:47,393
Is Mr. Lee the suspect?

429
00:37:48,268 --> 00:37:50,480
Everyone in this project
is a suspect.

430
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,106
Especially you, chief.

431
00:37:57,861 --> 00:38:00,281
The man from unit 706...
He’ll die.

432
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:05,295
He tried to kill the girl and me.

433
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:07,671
The man on the seventh floor...

434
00:38:07,746 --> 00:38:08,423
Soo Jin!

435
00:38:08,498 --> 00:38:09,915
Who are you calling?

436
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:13,210
Calm down. Please?

437
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,046
Nothing happened.

438
00:38:16,213 --> 00:38:18,591
If anything happens,
I’ll take care of it.

439
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:08,600
Ji-hoon?

440
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:08,910
Help!

441
00:41:36,496 --> 00:41:38,458
You live in unit 1005, right?

442
00:41:38,875 --> 00:41:39,791
Yes.

443
00:41:40,043 --> 00:41:42,295
Someone found this
in the elevator.

444
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:38,726
Hey.

445
00:42:39,018 --> 00:42:40,186
Good! You’re up.

446
00:42:40,311 --> 00:42:42,021
Let’s have breakfast.

447
00:42:45,691 --> 00:42:46,735
Last night...

448
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:50,488
Where did you go?

449
00:42:57,953 --> 00:43:00,498
Where would I go?
I slept beside you.

450
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,918
Are you okay?

451
00:43:07,755 --> 00:43:08,881
Sit down.

452
00:43:11,926 --> 00:43:13,970
Let’s eat quickly.
I have a busy day ahead.

453
00:43:36,826 --> 00:43:38,620
What was Ji-hoon like?

454
00:43:39,745 --> 00:43:41,163
Did something happen?

455
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:46,418
Did he hit you again?

456
00:43:50,381 --> 00:43:52,633
You really don’t remember, do you?

457
00:44:04,061 --> 00:44:07,856
When you said you’d quit
for about a month,

458
00:44:08,358 --> 00:44:11,568
you told me you’ll get divorced.

459
00:44:12,695 --> 00:44:15,406
Saying your husband
has changed.

460
00:44:16,573 --> 00:44:20,370
You were taking pills
for depression because of it.

461
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:27,335
By chance,

462
00:44:28,878 --> 00:44:32,048
was I seeing another man?

463
00:44:33,966 --> 00:44:36,135
That I don’t know.

464
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:41,140
But your husband thought so.

465
00:44:44,351 --> 00:44:45,603
Are you okay?

466
00:44:46,688 --> 00:44:48,230
Did you get the box?

467
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:53,745
The parcel?

468
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:56,530
Someone found it in the elevator.

469
00:44:56,781 --> 00:44:58,248
I gave it to your husband.

470
00:44:58,323 --> 00:44:59,291
When?

471
00:44:59,366 --> 00:45:00,493
Last night.

472
00:45:00,951 --> 00:45:02,828
It was past 2AM.

473
00:45:02,995 --> 00:45:06,791
Was he going on a trip?
He left with a big suitcase.

474
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:08,918
Yes.

475
00:45:38,406 --> 00:45:39,958
You want to change your flight?

476
00:45:40,033 --> 00:45:41,575
I don’t mind transferring.

477
00:45:41,743 --> 00:45:43,745
I’ll even pay for new tickets.

478
00:45:44,036 --> 00:45:46,080
Book us the earliest flight, please.

479
00:45:46,371 --> 00:45:47,498
Let me check.

480
00:45:52,586 --> 00:45:56,506
SOO JIN

481
00:45:58,676 --> 00:46:00,886
POLICE STATION
SOO JIN

482
00:46:05,391 --> 00:46:07,768
What do you mean?

483
00:46:08,395 --> 00:46:12,898
He snuck out a big suitcase
from unit 706.

484
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:15,776
He took it down the stairs.

485
00:46:17,028 --> 00:46:18,446
It looked heavy.

486
00:46:19,196 --> 00:46:20,906
But inside...

487
00:46:21,741 --> 00:46:26,578
The man from unit 706...
His body must’ve been there.

488
00:46:27,121 --> 00:46:30,916
Why do you think
his body was in the bag?

489
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,795
I heard screams.

490
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:35,796
I heard them fight.

491
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:41,051
I know I sound crazy.

492
00:46:43,596 --> 00:46:46,015
But I saw the man dying.

493
00:46:47,183 --> 00:46:48,058
No.

494
00:46:51,813 --> 00:46:53,773
I saw that he would die.

495
00:46:56,316 --> 00:46:58,235
Let me get this straight.

496
00:46:58,486 --> 00:47:02,615
So the man who lives in unit 706
was murdered.

497
00:47:03,031 --> 00:47:04,283
- Right?
- Yes.

498
00:47:04,741 --> 00:47:07,578
And you saw the killer, right?

499
00:47:09,121 --> 00:47:09,880
Yes.

500
00:47:09,955 --> 00:47:13,166
Did you see the killer’s face?

501
00:47:33,186 --> 00:47:34,313
Soo Jin!

502
00:47:36,273 --> 00:47:38,568
- Wait, sir!
- It’s him!

503
00:47:40,028 --> 00:47:42,821
He killed the man from unit 706.

504
00:47:43,698 --> 00:47:45,208
What are you talking about?

505
00:47:45,283 --> 00:47:46,658
I saw it.

506
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:50,455
I saw you coming out of
that man’s apartment!

507
00:47:51,038 --> 00:47:53,791
You’re seeing things.
Remember what the doctor said?

508
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,336
You’re making stuff up
like it really happened.

509
00:47:58,045 --> 00:47:58,805
Let’s go.

510
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,381
Hang on a second!

511
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:04,343
How did you know
she was here?

512
00:48:04,635 --> 00:48:05,886
That’s odd.

513
00:48:08,473 --> 00:48:11,058
After her accident,

514
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,310
I got worried.

515
00:48:14,353 --> 00:48:16,856
So, I set up a tracking app.
Can I take her now?

516
00:48:17,065 --> 00:48:18,358
Wait.

517
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,778
We’re not sure what’s going on.

518
00:48:23,278 --> 00:48:25,323
But she says she saw a corpse.

519
00:48:25,573 --> 00:48:27,616
It’s our job to check on it.

520
00:48:28,325 --> 00:48:29,326
Fine.

521
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:33,246
Then let’s all go and check.
That’ll solve everything.

522
00:48:47,886 --> 00:48:49,055
It can’t be.

523
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:52,358
I swear I saw him!

524
00:48:52,433 --> 00:48:53,601
Ms. Kim?

525
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:58,531
Unit 706 was never sold.
It’s been empty.

526
00:48:58,606 --> 00:49:02,401
There are a lot of unsold units
in this building.

527
00:49:03,986 --> 00:49:05,780
Can we go now?

528
00:49:08,658 --> 00:49:09,658
Soo Jin.

529
00:49:09,991 --> 00:49:11,460
- Ms. Kim.
- Soo Jin.

530
00:49:11,535 --> 00:49:13,538
Just one question.

531
00:49:14,788 --> 00:49:17,250
Why’d you go to the construction site
on the 13th?

532
00:49:18,835 --> 00:49:21,170
Do I have to answer that?

533
00:49:22,963 --> 00:49:24,090
Soo Jin!

534
00:49:29,178 --> 00:49:31,096
We’re leaving for Canada
in two days.

535
00:49:31,596 --> 00:49:33,223
I booked an earlier flight.

536
00:49:50,741 --> 00:49:52,743
Everything will get better there.

537
00:50:17,268 --> 00:50:18,770
Get some rest.

538
00:50:20,146 --> 00:50:22,065
I have things to wrap up.

539
00:50:22,815 --> 00:50:27,486
When I come back,
let’s forget everything and leave.

540
00:50:53,596 --> 00:50:54,555
Tenth floor.

541
00:50:54,971 --> 00:50:55,681
Ground floor.

542
00:50:56,306 --> 00:50:57,433
Going down.

543
00:50:59,851 --> 00:51:00,978
Ninth floor.

544
00:51:02,396 --> 00:51:03,440
Yes.

545
00:51:03,731 --> 00:51:05,441
I’m on my way down.

546
00:51:06,735 --> 00:51:09,070
Please stop coming to my house.

547
00:51:09,278 --> 00:51:11,113
You gave me no choice.

548
00:51:35,346 --> 00:51:36,806
- I’m sorry.
- Look!

549
00:51:38,808 --> 00:51:40,776
Stamp it now!

550
00:51:40,851 --> 00:51:43,480
Do what I say to pay me back.

551
00:51:44,188 --> 00:51:45,106
Right?

552
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:48,735
I’ll pay you back soon.
I’m sorry it’s late.

553
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,238
Do it tonight.

554
00:52:13,426 --> 00:52:14,718
Soo Jin.

555
00:52:22,435 --> 00:52:24,436
I was so worried about you.

556
00:52:24,561 --> 00:52:25,813
Where were you?

557
00:52:33,571 --> 00:52:34,780
Let’s go in.

558
00:52:57,345 --> 00:52:58,846
Did you see our ID stamps?

559
00:52:59,555 --> 00:53:00,640
Our stamps?

560
00:53:16,613 --> 00:53:18,616
You have an awesome memory.

561
00:53:22,161 --> 00:53:23,588
While you were gone,

562
00:53:23,663 --> 00:53:25,540
I thought about what you said.

563
00:53:25,873 --> 00:53:26,883
I’ll answer you later.

564
00:53:26,958 --> 00:53:28,668
Let’s meet at the site at 8PM.

565
00:53:34,923 --> 00:53:36,175
Don’t go there.

566
00:53:37,885 --> 00:53:38,886
What?

567
00:53:39,886 --> 00:53:42,223
You could get killed.

568
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,350
What do you mean?

569
00:53:44,808 --> 00:53:46,895
Are you trying to scare me?

570
00:53:47,728 --> 00:53:48,813
See you later.

571
00:54:16,925 --> 00:54:18,926
TO. LEE JI-HOON

572
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:20,803
Lee Ji-hoon...

573
00:54:24,515 --> 00:54:26,935
TO. KIM SOO JIN

574
00:54:27,268 --> 00:54:28,686
Kim Soo Jin...

575
00:54:30,355 --> 00:54:32,148
Kim Soo Jin...

576
00:55:24,575 --> 00:55:26,493
There are over 100 workers.

577
00:55:26,953 --> 00:55:28,455
Why pick on me?

578
00:55:30,165 --> 00:55:32,966
You stole the goods bit by bit

579
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:35,253
and pretended you didn’t know.

580
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:37,096
I saw the CCTV footages.

581
00:55:37,171 --> 00:55:39,048
You did it many times, chief.

582
00:55:39,215 --> 00:55:42,385
Thanks to you, we checked out
all the material dealer shops.

583
00:55:42,926 --> 00:55:46,230
Selling off that much stuff
would’ve raised red flags.

584
00:55:46,305 --> 00:55:48,140
But we found nothing.

585
00:55:49,725 --> 00:55:50,985
You didn’t sell them.

586
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:54,438
You put them in storage
to sneak them out slowly,

587
00:55:54,605 --> 00:55:57,150
didn’t you!

588
00:55:59,693 --> 00:56:02,571
You erased the CCTV every time.

589
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,198
But

590
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,535
why’d you break
the CCTV that night?

591
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:10,121
The CCTV wasn’t me!

592
00:56:12,165 --> 00:56:13,341
Okay!

593
00:56:13,416 --> 00:56:15,168
You admit to the rest, right?

594
00:56:15,626 --> 00:56:18,471
Order some food for him too.
He just confessed.

595
00:56:18,546 --> 00:56:20,423
It can’t be over $5.

596
00:56:20,881 --> 00:56:22,966
That’s not it!

597
00:56:23,468 --> 00:56:25,136
That night,

598
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:27,721
I saw someone.

599
00:56:43,821 --> 00:56:46,406
DREAM TOWN
NAMYANGJOO ROAD 861

600
00:57:23,026 --> 00:57:25,488
KIM SOO JIN

601
00:57:27,448 --> 00:57:28,366
Yes?

602
00:57:28,741 --> 00:57:29,741
Detective.

603
00:57:29,991 --> 00:57:31,870
Someone is about to be killed.

604
00:57:32,745 --> 00:57:34,913
I know it’s hard to believe.

605
00:57:35,331 --> 00:57:38,960
About to be killed?
Didn’t happen yet?

606
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:40,220
Yes.

607
00:57:40,295 --> 00:57:41,586
Where are you?

608
00:57:41,796 --> 00:57:43,965
Dream Town construction site.

609
00:57:44,465 --> 00:57:46,550
I’ll call you back.

610
00:57:49,678 --> 00:57:51,263
What did you just say?

611
00:57:51,638 --> 00:57:52,473
Right.

612
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:54,683
I know whose car it was.

613
00:57:54,933 --> 00:57:56,611
- Lee Ji-hoon?
- Yes.

614
00:57:56,686 --> 00:57:58,521
It was definitely his car.

615
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:02,775
I’m not certain because of the hat,

616
00:58:04,068 --> 00:58:05,778
but the driver seemed to be...

617
00:58:12,285 --> 00:58:13,420
Excuse me!

618
00:58:13,495 --> 00:58:14,786
Mr. Kim Sun-woo?

619
00:58:17,748 --> 00:58:19,625
Kim Sun-woo?

620
00:58:21,001 --> 00:58:22,378
Yes, that’s him.

621
00:58:23,671 --> 00:58:26,966
Son of a bitch.

622
00:59:41,290 --> 00:59:42,666
Why are you here?

623
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:48,381
Soo Jin!

624
00:59:53,218 --> 00:59:55,305
Stop! Soo Jin!

625
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,605
Where are you?

626
01:00:05,815 --> 01:00:07,525
Come out!

627
01:00:12,446 --> 01:00:13,906
Why are you here?

628
01:00:21,413 --> 01:00:23,331
It’s dangerous! Let’s go!

629
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:25,251
Soo Jin?

630
01:01:04,456 --> 01:01:05,208
Soo Jin...

631
01:01:08,293 --> 01:01:09,420
Stay back!

632
01:01:15,218 --> 01:01:16,635
Why’d you kill him?

633
01:01:17,553 --> 01:01:18,471
Why!

634
01:01:19,721 --> 01:01:21,015
Who are you?

635
01:01:21,975 --> 01:01:23,560
The man you killed...

636
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:26,436
Is it Ji-hoon?

637
01:01:27,521 --> 01:01:29,315
Let’s go down.
I’ll explain everything.

638
01:01:29,523 --> 01:01:31,693
Who the hell are you!

639
01:01:33,026 --> 01:01:36,405
You have to believe me, please.

640
01:01:36,948 --> 01:01:37,823
No.

641
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,076
I don’t trust you.

642
01:01:41,326 --> 01:01:43,496
You’re just a murderer.

643
01:01:49,626 --> 01:01:50,628
Stay back!

644
01:01:52,588 --> 01:01:53,506
Stop!

645
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:55,800
Soo Jin...

646
01:01:57,801 --> 01:01:58,970
Soo Jin, no!

647
01:02:00,263 --> 01:02:03,350
We’ll be in Canada in two days.
It’ll be all over then.

648
01:02:04,975 --> 01:02:06,853
I did all this for you.

649
01:02:16,403 --> 01:02:17,321
Stay back!

650
01:02:18,448 --> 01:02:19,698
Soo Jin, no!

651
01:02:34,255 --> 01:02:35,131
No!

652
01:02:36,048 --> 01:02:37,508
- Stop!
- Ms. Kim!

653
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:41,103
Get down!

654
01:02:41,178 --> 01:02:42,221
Are you okay?

655
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:48,770
He killed a man.

656
01:02:49,936 --> 01:02:51,480
The body is here.

657
01:03:00,156 --> 01:03:01,073
No...

658
01:03:01,908 --> 01:03:03,116
It can’t be.

659
01:03:06,036 --> 01:03:08,998
I swear I saw everything!

660
01:03:09,581 --> 01:03:10,591
I know what I saw!

661
01:03:10,666 --> 01:03:12,793
Stop it!
There’s no dead body!

662
01:03:15,588 --> 01:03:18,256
Looks like she’s got it wrong again.

663
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:21,310
He’s lying!

664
01:03:21,385 --> 01:03:22,345
No!

665
01:03:23,888 --> 01:03:25,306
I saw everything.

666
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,891
See!

667
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:40,030
I saw it.

668
01:03:40,446 --> 01:03:42,531
I swear I saw it!

669
01:03:43,575 --> 01:03:45,576
I know what I saw...

670
01:03:46,285 --> 01:03:48,161
You’re hallucinating.

671
01:03:48,538 --> 01:03:50,123
Now, stop it.

672
01:03:51,916 --> 01:03:52,875
No...

673
01:04:03,218 --> 01:04:04,970
I swear I saw it.

674
01:04:05,763 --> 01:04:08,265
I know what I saw!

675
01:04:09,016 --> 01:04:10,643
I saw everything!

676
01:04:11,226 --> 01:04:12,603
- Stop!
- Let go!

677
01:04:12,770 --> 01:04:14,313
Let me go!

678
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,323
- Calm down!
- Stop!

679
01:04:16,398 --> 01:04:17,400
Stop it!

680
01:04:31,706 --> 01:04:34,000
Get up. Let’s go.

681
01:04:38,211 --> 01:04:39,880
Are you happy now?

682
01:04:41,131 --> 01:04:43,091
I’m taking my wife home.

683
01:04:48,931 --> 01:04:49,973
Stop.

684
01:04:53,853 --> 01:04:56,188
What wife, you bastard!

685
01:04:57,773 --> 01:05:00,860
You broke the CCTV
on the 13th, didn’t you?

686
01:05:03,405 --> 01:05:04,780
- Hold him.
- What?

687
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:06,123
Get him!

688
01:05:06,198 --> 01:05:07,241
Yes, sir.

689
01:05:12,663 --> 01:05:16,876
Why rack your brain?
Just dig till you find the answer.

690
01:05:18,168 --> 01:05:20,171
But, sir... Wait!

691
01:05:37,188 --> 01:05:38,448
Kim Sun-woo!

692
01:05:38,523 --> 01:05:39,898
What did you do!

693
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:08,010
Let me meet him, please?

694
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:11,388
Of course. Let’s go.

695
01:06:18,855 --> 01:06:19,980
Ms. Kim?

696
01:06:25,111 --> 01:06:26,278
Are you okay?

697
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:36,455
The company went bankrupt
due to Lee Ji-hoon’s gambling debt.

698
01:06:38,331 --> 01:06:40,668
We fought about that at the site.

699
01:06:41,335 --> 01:06:43,211
And I killed him by accident.

700
01:06:43,921 --> 01:06:45,673
Why’d you go back to the site?

701
01:06:46,506 --> 01:06:48,133
Once demolition starts,

702
01:06:50,178 --> 01:06:52,805
I worried the body would be found,
so I went back.

703
01:06:53,348 --> 01:06:55,733
I planned to kill Soo Jin
for her insurance money.

704
01:06:55,808 --> 01:06:59,811
So I acted like I was Lee Ji-hoon.

705
01:07:04,358 --> 01:07:05,235
Here.

706
01:07:07,695 --> 01:07:11,783
He bought his current place
4 months ago.

707
01:07:11,950 --> 01:07:13,951
Your real house is in Seoul.

708
01:07:14,993 --> 01:07:18,673
If you go there,
maybe you’ll remember something.

709
01:07:18,748 --> 01:07:19,998
Kim Sun-woo.

710
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:22,751
Who is he?

711
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:29,008
He’s your adoptive older brother.

712
01:07:40,145 --> 01:07:45,150
I don’t think all your stories were lies.

713
01:07:49,653 --> 01:07:51,655
What does that matter now?

714
01:07:53,031 --> 01:07:54,491
Think whatever you want.

715
01:07:54,991 --> 01:07:56,703
Though I was adopted,

716
01:07:57,703 --> 01:07:59,788
you’re the only family I have.

717
01:08:00,415 --> 01:08:01,248
Tell me.

718
01:08:01,623 --> 01:08:03,626
What in the world happened?

719
01:08:04,585 --> 01:08:06,671
I don’t know what you mean.

720
01:08:08,756 --> 01:08:10,508
I killed your husband.

721
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:13,010
I planned to kill you
for your insurance payout.

722
01:08:14,011 --> 01:08:16,848
If you died on the mountain,
I would’ve walked free.

723
01:08:18,306 --> 01:08:19,766
It’s too bad.

724
01:08:20,685 --> 01:08:22,686
If what I saw at the site

725
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:28,275
is a memory of actual events,
it means I was there that night.

726
01:08:28,485 --> 01:08:29,568
Memory?

727
01:08:30,278 --> 01:08:31,528
Can you tell

728
01:08:32,113 --> 01:08:34,948
what’s real from what’s made up?

729
01:08:38,578 --> 01:08:40,080
Do you think you’re sane?

730
01:08:47,628 --> 01:08:49,338
I have nothing more to say.

731
01:08:50,590 --> 01:08:51,506
Let’s end it.

732
01:08:53,885 --> 01:08:55,261
Escort her out.

733
01:08:57,138 --> 01:08:59,973
Cut the nonsense and just leave.

734
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:05,230
Let’s go.

735
01:09:09,483 --> 01:09:10,860
Unit 706.

736
01:09:17,325 --> 01:09:21,286
What about what I saw there?

737
01:09:45,395 --> 01:09:46,228
Kid!

738
01:09:46,896 --> 01:09:47,771
Wait.

739
01:09:54,695 --> 01:09:55,780
Are you okay?

740
01:10:11,713 --> 01:10:12,921
Soo Jin!

741
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:19,511
Is your name Soo Jin too?

742
01:10:21,013 --> 01:10:23,223
Yes, I’m Choi Soo Jin.

743
01:10:24,641 --> 01:10:26,351
It’s Kim Soo Jin now.

744
01:10:27,228 --> 01:10:28,571
Kim Sun-woo’s little sister.

745
01:10:28,646 --> 01:10:29,813
Kim Soo Jin.

746
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:52,295
That should do
for Lee Ji-hoon’s case.

747
01:10:53,003 --> 01:10:54,921
Unit 706...

748
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:58,343
This is her adoption record.

749
01:10:58,468 --> 01:10:59,385
Let’s see.

750
01:10:59,676 --> 01:11:01,805
Kim Tae-jun lived in unit 706.

751
01:11:02,513 --> 01:11:04,098
Son, Kim Sun-woo.

752
01:11:05,975 --> 01:11:09,020
Then it says Kim Tae-jun
went missing.

753
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:11,815
CERTIFICATE OF ADOPTION

754
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,901
Where is Kim Tae-jun?

755
01:11:25,328 --> 01:11:26,705
KIM SOO JIN

756
01:12:50,871 --> 01:12:51,790
Bitch!

757
01:13:14,228 --> 01:13:15,521
Sun-woo...

758
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,080
Soo Jin.

759
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:35,500
Go to Ji-hoon’s dorm now.

760
01:13:36,291 --> 01:13:38,711
If he asks, tell him I sent you.

761
01:13:39,003 --> 01:13:41,255
Just say you came
right after school.

762
01:13:41,546 --> 01:13:42,840
How can I?

763
01:13:43,841 --> 01:13:45,260
It’s because of me!

764
01:13:45,843 --> 01:13:47,845
This happened because of me!

765
01:13:49,138 --> 01:13:51,140
It’s not your fault.

766
01:13:51,515 --> 01:13:53,518
You didn’t do anything wrong.

767
01:13:53,851 --> 01:13:55,353
Just stay focused.

768
01:13:55,895 --> 01:13:56,980
Listen to me.

769
01:13:57,230 --> 01:13:58,940
You never came home today.

770
01:14:00,358 --> 01:14:02,660
If the cops ask,
say you don’t know.

771
01:14:02,735 --> 01:14:03,570
Got it?

772
01:14:33,516 --> 01:14:34,766
Sun-woo...

773
01:14:43,943 --> 01:14:44,826
Yeah?

774
01:14:44,901 --> 01:14:46,536
I’m at the location you told me.

775
01:14:46,611 --> 01:14:47,905
We found Kim Tae-jun.

776
01:15:01,126 --> 01:15:04,296
SEOUL SEOCHO-GU
WEVE CONDO #903

777
01:15:29,988 --> 01:15:32,325
Soo Jin! Where are you?

778
01:15:32,908 --> 01:15:36,078
Your husband came and wreaked havoc
looking for you!

779
01:15:36,328 --> 01:15:38,665
He was screaming
like a madman!

780
01:15:40,125 --> 01:15:41,375
Soo Jin!

781
01:15:49,883 --> 01:15:51,176
You’re alive?

782
01:15:54,638 --> 01:15:55,681
Soo Jin!

783
01:15:56,306 --> 01:15:58,851
Did you think I’d die
without you two?

784
01:16:02,271 --> 01:16:03,440
Soo Jin! Stop!

785
01:16:04,648 --> 01:16:07,193
You put your father in a suitcase...

786
01:16:08,026 --> 01:16:08,953
Okay.
KIM SOO JIN

787
01:16:09,028 --> 01:16:09,695
KIM SOO JIN

788
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:14,033
Yes?

789
01:16:14,325 --> 01:16:15,785
Lee Ji-hoon is alive!

790
01:16:16,118 --> 01:16:18,663
What? Lee Ji-hoon is dead.

791
01:16:19,455 --> 01:16:20,581
Ms. Kim?

792
01:16:20,956 --> 01:16:23,635
I don’t know what you saw,
but calm down.

793
01:16:23,710 --> 01:16:25,670
Lee Ji-hoon is alive!

794
01:16:29,548 --> 01:16:30,550
Hello?

795
01:16:31,926 --> 01:16:32,843
Ms. Kim?

796
01:16:34,053 --> 01:16:35,138
Stay back.

797
01:16:36,096 --> 01:16:37,056
Stay back!

798
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,516
Sir!

799
01:16:41,853 --> 01:16:43,480
- It’s not Lee Ji-hoon.
- What?

800
01:17:06,711 --> 01:17:07,961
Forensics called.

801
01:17:08,211 --> 01:17:11,131
The body is not Lee Ji-hoon’s.

802
01:17:12,716 --> 01:17:14,435
- Take the call, sir.
- Shit!

803
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:16,511
Then where the hell is he?

804
01:17:52,048 --> 01:17:54,341
We were happy once.

805
01:17:57,303 --> 01:17:58,388
Right.

806
01:17:59,096 --> 01:18:01,473
The art director said
you don’t remember anything.

807
01:18:02,516 --> 01:18:04,268
You always looked at me like that.

808
01:18:04,976 --> 01:18:07,396
Know how much it hurt me?

809
01:18:08,773 --> 01:18:10,358
What are you saying?

810
01:18:10,608 --> 01:18:11,650
Soo Jin...

811
01:18:12,068 --> 01:18:14,153
How could you be so selfish?

812
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:16,280
Don’t you remember?

813
01:18:18,073 --> 01:18:18,825
Mr. Lee.

814
01:18:19,491 --> 01:18:22,495
If you stamped this
for me earlier,

815
01:18:22,661 --> 01:18:25,006
I didn’t have to give you
the special treatment.

BENEFICIARY: LEE JI-HOON
I’m sorry.

818
01:18:29,418 --> 01:18:30,428
So?

819
01:18:30,503 --> 01:18:31,963
How will you kill her?

820
01:18:32,921 --> 01:18:34,298
I’m sorry. I can...

821
01:18:36,843 --> 01:18:39,636
The interest goes up by the day.

822
01:18:40,513 --> 01:18:42,348
Today’s our anniversary.

823
01:18:43,475 --> 01:18:46,101
I will tell my wife
how much I love her.

824
01:18:49,105 --> 01:18:50,731
When she learns the truth,

825
01:18:51,983 --> 01:18:55,528
my wife, who’s been deceiving me,
will jump down.

826
01:18:57,655 --> 01:19:01,450
Or she’ll beg forgiveness
and come back to me.

827
01:19:02,868 --> 01:19:06,706
What the fuck are you saying?

828
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:11,335
Son of a bitch!

829
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:36,695
I told you to wait!

830
01:19:37,653 --> 01:19:38,946
I warned you!

831
01:19:39,613 --> 01:19:41,741
I said wait, son of a bitch!

832
01:20:09,726 --> 01:20:10,645
Soo Jin.

833
01:20:13,565 --> 01:20:14,606
Soo Jin!

834
01:20:15,483 --> 01:20:16,400
Stay back.

835
01:20:16,693 --> 01:20:18,118
- I can explain!
- Stop!

836
01:20:18,193 --> 01:20:20,571
I can explain everything!

CANADA IMMIGRATION GUIDE

838
01:20:28,413 --> 01:20:29,830
You’re leaving with Sun-woo?

839
01:20:30,956 --> 01:20:32,958
That’s why you wanted a divorce?

840
01:20:33,876 --> 01:20:35,170
Soo Jin, no!

841
01:20:36,253 --> 01:20:37,963
This is crazy!

842
01:20:42,843 --> 01:20:43,845
Stop it.

843
01:20:45,346 --> 01:20:46,931
You’re crazy!

844
01:20:49,058 --> 01:20:50,185
Crazy?

845
01:20:50,851 --> 01:20:53,480
How can I not go crazy
stuck between you two?

846
01:20:58,316 --> 01:21:00,736
You think I’m crazy?

847
01:21:03,113 --> 01:21:05,116
I’m crazy because of you two!

848
01:21:06,241 --> 01:21:08,243
You and Sun-woo!

849

01:21:47,491 --> 01:21:49,043
- Put an APB on a car.
- What car?

852
01:21:49,118 --> 01:21:50,328
Mine! Hurry!

853
01:22:07,095 --> 01:22:08,555
Are you okay?

854
01:22:25,155 --> 01:22:26,698
It’s all right.

855
01:22:31,076 --> 01:22:31,995
It’s okay.

856
01:22:34,246 --> 01:22:35,206
What now?

857
01:23:19,833 --> 01:23:21,585
Back then and now...

858
01:23:25,215 --> 01:23:27,133
you haven’t changed.

859
01:23:36,058 --> 01:23:40,063
You decide and take responsibility
all by yourself.

860
01:23:41,146 --> 01:23:42,231
Soo Jin.

861
01:23:50,323 --> 01:23:51,908
I’m sorry, Sun-woo.

862
01:23:53,493 --> 01:23:54,951
It’s because of me...

863
01:23:59,373 --> 01:24:00,125
No!

864
01:24:00,833 --> 01:24:01,751
No...

865
01:24:02,210 --> 01:24:03,251
Forgive me.

866
01:24:04,086 --> 01:24:04,878
No!

867
01:24:05,213 --> 01:24:06,463
No!

868
01:24:07,090 --> 01:24:08,215
Soo Jin!

869
01:24:25,983 --> 01:24:27,068
What are you doing?

870
01:24:53,301 --> 01:24:55,180
I’ve always been curious.

871
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:57,598
Sun-woo and me...

872
01:24:58,306 --> 01:25:01,601
I wonder who loves you more.

873
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:17,951
How Sun-woo wants to save you.

874
01:25:19,578 --> 01:25:21,580
And how I want to kill you.

875
01:25:22,373 --> 01:25:24,250
They’re all for love, aren’t they?

876
01:25:40,391 --> 01:25:44,061
Too bad Sun-woo didn’t see this.

877
01:25:51,193 --> 01:25:52,111
No!

878
01:25:54,196 --> 01:25:55,156
No...

879
01:26:05,708 --> 01:26:08,043
Where is she!
Where’s Soo Jin, you bastard!

880
01:26:08,670 --> 01:26:11,840
You should ask me nicely
at a time like this.

881
01:26:12,173 --> 01:26:13,341
You asshole!

882
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:17,928
You’re too late.

883
01:26:19,096 --> 01:26:20,640
Go wait in hell!

884
01:26:32,693 --> 01:26:33,903
Over there!

885
01:26:44,163 --> 01:26:45,165
Soo Jin...

886
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:50,503
Damn it!

887
01:27:00,430 --> 01:27:02,140
Stop! Come here!

888
01:27:12,275 --> 01:27:13,901
Stay still!

889
01:27:18,865 --> 01:27:19,906
Soo Jin!

890
01:27:23,953 --> 01:27:24,870
Soo Jin!

891
01:27:27,915 --> 01:27:29,000
Where are you?

892
01:27:32,295 --> 01:27:33,211
Soo Jin!

893
01:27:34,005 --> 01:27:34,963
Soo Jin!

894
01:27:35,881 --> 01:27:37,508
Are you okay?

895
01:27:38,175 --> 01:27:39,635
Wake up!

896
01:27:45,475 --> 01:27:46,391
Soo Jin...

897
01:27:55,860 --> 01:27:56,828
Where’s the fire?

898
01:27:56,903 --> 01:27:58,111
Unit 903 is on fire.

899
01:28:11,876 --> 01:28:12,960
Soo Jin.

900
01:28:14,045 --> 01:28:15,088
Soo Jin?

901
01:28:16,546 --> 01:28:17,473
Sun-woo...

902
01:28:17,548 --> 01:28:18,550
Yes, it’s me.

903
01:28:19,008 --> 01:28:19,966
You came?

904
01:28:23,430 --> 01:28:24,388
It’s okay.

905
01:28:27,850 --> 01:28:29,018
Oh, no!

906
01:28:30,270 --> 01:28:31,855
It’s okay.

907
01:28:33,606 --> 01:28:35,358
I’m fine.

908
01:28:37,401 --> 01:28:40,363
I remember everything now.

909
01:28:42,115 --> 01:28:43,156
I’m sorry.

910
01:28:44,241 --> 01:28:45,451
Don’t cry.

911
01:28:46,326 --> 01:28:48,413
It’s not your fault.

912
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:51,373
Don’t look back.

913
01:29:00,591 --> 01:29:04,053
Soo Jin...
Go to Canada.

914
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:08,891
Sun-woo...

915
01:29:32,581 --> 01:29:34,125
Where’s my brother?

916
01:29:37,045 --> 01:29:39,671
Mr. Kim Sun-woo

917
01:29:41,256 --> 01:29:43,091
was found dead.

918
01:29:43,968 --> 01:29:46,345
He covered you from the flames.

919
01:29:47,555 --> 01:29:48,973
To save you.

920
01:29:51,266 --> 01:29:51,943
MAY HE REST IN PEACE

921
01:29:52,018 --> 01:29:53,903
MAY HE REST IN PEACE
There’s a flash drive inside.

922
01:29:53,978 --> 01:29:56,230
We received it
from the Canadian embassy.

923
01:29:57,898 --> 01:30:00,026
Take a look when you get well.

924
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:05,698
Is there a reason
you’re rushing to immigrate?

925
01:30:08,241 --> 01:30:09,493
The reason?

926
01:30:22,590 --> 01:30:24,591
I made a promise when I was young.

927
01:30:26,678 --> 01:30:30,015
I forgot about it,
but she remembered.

928
01:30:56,331 --> 01:30:57,541
Remember?

929
01:30:58,585 --> 01:30:59,135
SOO JIN, LET’S LIVE HERE LATER

930
01:30:59,210 --> 01:31:01,253
SOO JIN, LET’S LIVE HERE LATER
You gave it to me.

931
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:03,005
What?

932
01:31:04,715 --> 01:31:06,425
You still have this?

933
01:31:06,885 --> 01:31:08,470
It’s Vermilion Lake.

934
01:31:09,386 --> 01:31:11,138
It’s in Canada.

935
01:31:12,431 --> 01:31:13,808
When I was young,

936
01:31:14,308 --> 01:31:16,143
I had a recurring dream.

937
01:31:17,978 --> 01:31:22,816
Playing in a pretty house
by that lake with you.

938
01:31:25,236 --> 01:31:27,655
That dream became my memory

939
01:31:28,113 --> 01:31:29,865
that got me through rough times.

940
01:31:31,408 --> 01:31:32,293
Soo Jin.

941
01:31:32,368 --> 01:31:33,495
Listen.

942
01:31:35,330 --> 01:31:36,831
I’m leaving for Canada.

943
01:31:38,375 --> 01:31:40,376
I want to start over there.

944
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:50,678
I want to move there

945
01:31:52,596 --> 01:31:54,898
and give her a chance
to start over.

946
01:31:54,973 --> 01:31:59,228
Even if I can’t, she has to go.

947
01:32:01,563 --> 01:32:03,283
Please. She has to go.

948
01:32:03,358 --> 01:32:06,485
SOO JIN, LET’S LIVE HERE LATER

949
01:32:13,493 --> 01:32:14,701
There...

950
01:32:16,578 --> 01:32:18,540
our memories await us.

951
01:33:07,671 --> 01:33:10,175
Great. Now for the bride’s family.

952
01:33:19,308 --> 01:33:21,393
Is there no other family?

953
01:33:22,103 --> 01:33:24,730
It’s just us.
I’m her brother.

954
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:26,606
Okay, then.

955
01:33:30,028 --> 01:33:33,748
Your eyes are red.
Don’t want to send her off?

956
01:33:33,823 --> 01:33:35,783
Ah... No...

957
01:33:37,368 --> 01:33:39,170
Really? Did you cry?

958
01:33:39,245 --> 01:33:40,663
No way.

959
01:33:40,788 --> 01:33:42,040
Look up.

960
01:33:42,206 --> 01:33:43,206
Mister?

961
01:33:43,541 --> 01:33:47,961
The groom stands to her right.
Could you stand to her left?

962
01:33:48,338 --> 01:33:50,465
Ah, there? Sure.

963
01:33:59,598 --> 01:34:01,433
Don’t want to send me off?

964
01:34:02,476 --> 01:34:03,936
Then why are you?

965
01:34:06,981 --> 01:34:08,273
Should I not?

966
01:34:11,986 --> 01:34:13,863
Look over here, please.

967
01:34:14,946 --> 01:34:17,075
One, two, three!
