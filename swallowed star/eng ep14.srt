(It is said)

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,500
(that he's beyond
God of War.)

31
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,200
(We can't let
Mr. Lu Gang die for nothing.)

32
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,230

33

(They are the...)

38
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,800
This one's mine.
You can leave now.

39
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,760
(Looks like the mixed-race man
being protected)

40
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,600
(is the most important person
in the team.)

41
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,600
This is ours!

42
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,000
(Sniper!)

43
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,500
Back off if you want to stay alive!

44
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,000
Those three from the Paulinus Clan
are not to be trifled with.

45
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,000
Once you intervene in this,
you can't get out.

46
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,200
Have you decided?

47
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:23,800
Don't forget

48
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,040
my teammate's got a sniper rifle
pointing at you, too.

49
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,120
Why get in the way?

50
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,000
Warriors should never rob others.

51
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,330
You shouldn't have flaunted.

52
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,730
(They've parted. It's time!)

53
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,360
Captain, Chen, I have an idea.

54
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,800
Done?

55
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,630
Please spare the Indian team.

56
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,260
Who are you to make demands?

57
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,800
Because
I will save your Young Master's life.

58
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,000
(Blank ammunition).

59
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,150
If you don't spare them,
I won't help you anymore.

60
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,800
Bastard!
You're just a primary senior warrior!

61
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,300
Wait, we will let them go.

62
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,400
Do we just let it go?

63
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,100
Sniper rifles won't threat us much.

64
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,400
But Young Master
is only an intermediate senior warrior.

65
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,800
If he's shot, he might be dead
or seriously injured.

66
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:22,860
Young Master. You're here to practice.
Just deal with the monsters yourself.

67
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,900
All right, let's go.

68
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,730
You're lucky this time. Luo Feng.

69
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,430
A valuable prey was right
in front of us!

70
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:06,330
Your safety comes first
in this operation.

71
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,600
Please understand.

72
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,500
Pan Ya.

73
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,330
Master Liu.

74
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,660
The two-headed black snake is
indeed a treasure.

75
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,730
But not nearly as important as
Young Master's safety.

76
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,230
Huya Squad should know that

77
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,860
when taking this task.

78
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:31,160
If anything happens to him,
you know what would happen next.

79
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,630
Got it.

80
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,800
It seems that Fire Hammer Team
has grown a lot in strength.

81
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:38,700
I see.

82
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,830
Captain, we can't hesitate anymore
especially for Luo Feng.

83
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,000
They say Luo Feng is
a primary senior warrior now.

84
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,630
This kid's got a lot of potential.
We can't just let it be.

85
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,000
I'll see what I can do. At the worst,

86
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,560
we'd pay Mr. Liu and others
for help.

87
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,200
Hang in there.

88
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,660
Can you still see Huya Squad?

89
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,060
Yes,
they're heading north down the street.

90
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,330
I want to shoot them all!

91
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,800
Their previous secret plot
is found by us.

92
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,660
So they don't want us to be stronger.

93
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:35,060
They might strike again
if they get an opportunity.

94
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,600
They got backing. There are 9 of them.
It's harder to get avenge for Zhang.

95
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,060
Our safety is also a problem.

96
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,100
Captain, Chen.

97
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,330
Why don't you fall back
with the Indian team?

98
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,100
Luo Feng, you mean...

99
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,900
This time, they held back because
of their Young Master.

100
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,860
They're far more powerful than us,

101
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,000
but they gave in.
Once their Young Master is settled,

102
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,400
there's a good chance
they will retaliate madly.

103
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:05,300
It would be safer to go
with the Indian team at this point.

104
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,530
You're not coming with us?

105
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,700
If two advanced senior warriors
launch attack,

106
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,160
we may not even have a chance to react.

107
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,330
So instead of waiting and defending,

108
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,330
I'd better track them down
and know their movements.

109
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,670
Then I'll go with you.

110
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,300
Chen, I can do it. I have spirit energy.

111
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,000
I can get away even if it's dangerous.

112
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:30,140
Luo Feng has a point.
You're just a liability.

113
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,230
Trust Luo Feng.

114
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,860
This is a much more dangerous situation.

115
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,900
An advanced senior warrior can kill
a primary senior warrior easily.

116
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,700
And there are two, be very careful!

117
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,500
Don't take any chances.

118
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:48,130
If you're discovered, escape first!

119
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,130
=Swallowed Star=

120
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,460
(It should be here.)

121
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,260
Pan Ya, the information you gave me on
the Fire Hammer Team is reliable, right?

122
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,000
Absolutely. We have accurate information
on them.

123
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,300
The only problem is Luo Feng. I think

124
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:18,600
he's as good as
a primary senior warrior.

125
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,530
In that case,

126
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,040
call me when your team finds out
where Fire Hammer Team is.

127
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,500
Yes.

128
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,230
(I can defeat
the Huya Squad all by myself now.)

129
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,830
(When they're separated
from the two advanced senior warriors,)

130
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,730
(I'm going to take them down.)

131
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,660
(If Huya Squad
has lost fighting capacity,)

132
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,230
(they won't attack Fire Hammer Team.)

133
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,130
Hump.

134
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,400
It's cool to have a rich dad.

135
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,800
He can hire 2 advanced senior warriors
as bodyguards,

136
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,860
and let our entire team protect him.

137
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,000
Don't compare yourself with him.

138
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,060
Time to go.

139
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,400
What about the hotel, boss?

140
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,000
One-eye and Li Xiao will stay.
Let's go now.

141
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,700
(The other two should still
be at the hotel, shall I attack?)

142
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:46,100
(If I do, the other 7 would be on alert.
I'll wait.)

143
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,630
(Patience.
I'm sure the chance will come.)

144
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,430
(Too organized.)

145
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:40,460
(Two of Huya Squad's men are staying.
There's no chance at all.)

146
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,800
(It's day 10 and I can't wait anymore.)

147
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,400
(Zhang Zehu and Li Xiao should be
at the hotel today.)

148
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,300
(I'll beat them
while they're scattered.)

149
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,730
(The person who stays
should be on a lower floor.)

150
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,660
How's the injury?

151
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,850
It's no big deal. Fire Hammer Team's got
a vendetta against us.

152
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,130
They're dead!

153
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,900
Hu, I heard you went straight to
Luo Feng's house.

154
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:15,100
Ha ha, I can't deal with him,
but his family is a piece of cake.

155
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,560
Assaulting warriors' family members
is a felony.

156
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,430
And there are many monitors
at his place.

157
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,000
Yes, but outside that area is fine.

158
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,400
Oh, I see.

159
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,660
Remember Cobra?

160
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,700
Those desperadoes can do that well.

161
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,530
Cobra's been investigating
Luo Feng's family for some time.

162
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:47,130
His dad sometimes goes back to
Nan'an Residence to meet his mates.

163
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,460
There's a pretty covert road
on his mom's way to grocery store.

164
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:57,930
These are ideal places
with less surveillance.

165
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,500
And the families of Zhang Ke and Chen Gu
in his neighborhood.

166
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'll find a way to take them all down.

167
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:16,600
Shh.

168
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,430
How dare you hurt my family.
I'll make you pay!

169
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:19,200
This is Cobra's regular call.
If I don't answer,

170
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,230
he'll know I'm in danger. I don't know
what will happen to your family then.

171
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,360
Let go now!

172
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,000
There's no regular call!

173
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,430
It's too late now.

174
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,290
(Charon, advanced senior warrior.)

175
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,290
(Lieutenant of Thunder Team.
Li Wei's bodyguard.)
