(Previously on Swallowed Star)
(The battle begins.)

26
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,880
(I'd better keep it a secret for now)

27
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,880
(that I'm a Spirit Master.)

28
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,150
(How dare someone use the volunteer team
and the injured warriors as a bait)

29
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,840
(to hunt high-ranking monsters.)

30
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,460
(It's so terrible!)

31
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,580
(Whoever it is,)

32
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,320
(we'll come after them.)

33
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,920
(Maybe...)

34
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,920
(Ah!)

35
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,040
(Zhang Ke!)

36
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,320
(Right.)

37
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,740
(If Gao Feng fights that old monster,)

38
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,850
(he will surely die,)

39
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,050
(and that old monster
will be badly injured.)

40
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,590
(Then we can)

41
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,980
(take advantage of it.)

42
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,300
=Episode 10=

43
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,430
Run!

44
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,270
Let's fan out.
At least some of us would survive.

45
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:17,210
(Why did Huya Squad do this?)

46
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,410
(Is it because of me?)

47
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,550
Luo Feng is a Spirit Master?

48
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,360
Follow me. We'll all survive.

49
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,960
Listen to Luo Feng.

50
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,780
The Spirit Master is awesome!

51
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,800
The skull is the hardest part
of a Bloodthirsty Tank.

52
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,030
Aim at its eyes, ears or leg joints.

53
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,570
We didn't kill anyone of them!

54
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:20,560
We didn't miss them.
But they blocked it.

55
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,560
Luo Feng is damn lucky!

56
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,900
Don't worry.

57
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,520
They are injured
and being chased by the herd.

58
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,000
No way they'll survive.

59
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,240
Let's go.

60
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,280
The old monster is on the move.
We need to catch it now.

61
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,900
Bleeding has stopped.

62
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,710
Huya Squad, these bastards!

63
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,710
It must be them
who attacked the volunteer team.

64
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,200
Looks like them.

65
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,180
How is it?

66
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,730
I won't die.

67
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,270
Ahem.

68
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,800
My career as a warrior is over.

69
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,750
Alas.

70
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,180
You took the shot for me.

71
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:21,730
No.

72
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,100
It's my fault.

73
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,730
I think Huya Squad attacked us

74
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,960
because I offended Zhang Zehu before.

75
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,630
Don't blame yourselves.

76
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,160
Compared with those killed
by monsters in the Great Nirvana,

77
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:41,400
I'm lucky that I'm still alive.

78
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,430
As a child, I swore that

79
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,630
I would kill these monsters
when I grew up.

80
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,760
Then I passed the warrior test,

81
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,630
and became a hero.

82
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,230
A few years later, I started a family.

83
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,860
Zhang, you could have gone further.

84
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,250
Alas.

85
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,600
Not exactly.

86
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:09,500
I've killed many monsters
and I'm getting tired of this.

87
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,500
Every time I went to the wilderness,

88
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,430
my wife and children would worry
about my safety.

89
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,730
I'm also worried
that I won't see them again.

90
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,160
But I didn't have the courage to quit.

91
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,130
The injury gives me a reason to quit.

92
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,600
Brother, enjoy a peaceful life then.

93
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,060
You can be an instructor
in the Extreme Martial Club.

94
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,660
And then you would have more time
for your wife and kids.

95
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,330
By the way, Luo Feng.

96
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,260
Why didn't you tell us
you're a Spirit Master?

97
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,760
I don't want to get into trouble.

98
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,900
Once it is disclosed, I have to
say goodbye to my peaceful life.

99
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,780
Yeah.

100
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,300
He's right.

101
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:57,930
The army, the martial clubs
and the clans

102
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,000
are trying all they can to

103
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,730
get Spirit Masters.

104
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,940
I hope you can keep it a secret for me.
Don't tell anyone.

105
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,670
Of course we won't.

106
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,080
Ha-ha.

107
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,400
The Fire Hammer Team
has a Spirit Master now.

108
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,230
If Huya Squad knew it,

109
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,460
they wouldn't dare to play tricks with us.

110
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,500
=Swallowed Star=

111
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,130
Boss, where is it now?

112
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,260
It's about 4 miles from us.

113
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,460
It has been staying there for a while.

114
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,460
That's good.

115
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,230
We're almost there. Hurry up.

116
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,860
The moon wolf!

117
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,130
Seeing from its size,
it should be an advanced beast officer.

118
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,360
But it seems to be seriously injured.

119
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,860
It seems to be very manic.

120
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,110
It's not safe here.
We need to evacuate right now.

121
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,860
Captain, since it's seriously injured,

122
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,330
let's kill it now,

123
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,460
in case it would hurt others.

124
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,560
Even if it's seriously injured,
we can't beat it.

125
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,560
Captain, I'll try.

126
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,900
Are you sure you would win?

127
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,100
No, but I can escape unscathed.

128
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:42,900
It will be OK.

129
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:53,360
All right, be careful.
Don't force yourself.

130
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,600
Be careful!

131
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,330
OK.

132
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:57,430
Don't worry.

133
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,160
Zhang Ke.

134
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,960
Do you think Luo Feng
can kill that moon wolf?

135
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,530
According to his previous performance,

136
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,030
Luo Feng has reached the level of
an advanced soldier in strength.

137
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:24,630
And Spirit Master is two levels higher.

138
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,300
That is, the intermediate
senior warrior.

139
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:28,830
Right.

140
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,330
But it's not easy for
an intermediate senior warrior

141
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,360
to win the moon wolf,
an advanced beast officer.

142
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:37,630
Fortunately, it was seriously injured.
Luo Feng still has chance.

143
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,660
(Its target is actually the fly-cutters!)

144
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,660
(It reacts like this,)

145
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,000
(maybe because it was hurt
by fly-cutters of other Spirit Master?)

146
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,160
(Ha.)

147
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,060
(Fine, be my touchstone.)

148
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,260
(I'll see what I'm capable of.)

149
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:22,700
(So fast.)

150
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,360
Luo Feng's fly-cutters didn't work?

151
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,660
(I should focus all my strength )

152
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,360
(on one point as I once did.)

153
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,130
(I have to lead it into the air)

154
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,560
(and then use the fly-cutters
to slow it down.)

155
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,760
Got you!

156
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,260
Is it serious?

157
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,560
No, I'm lucky this time.

158
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,530
It's not about luck.
You adjusted your tactics in time

159
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,260
and focused on one fly-cutter

160
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,360
which made it six times
stronger and faster.

161
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,560
So that you could kill it
in the last blow.

162
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,230
Look!

163
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,560
What is it?

164
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,930
Go.

165
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:26,760
What?

166
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,900
Fur, teeth and claws.

167
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,900
These high-valued stuffs
have been robbed.

168
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,890
How dare they rob our stuff!

169
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:39,900
They're so dead!

170
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,300
They just dissected its body.

171
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,360
For security reasons, they'd rush to
the supply base immediately.

172
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,530
So

173
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,430
let's go to the supply base now

174
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,600
and try to stop the poachers on the way.

175
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,030
So

176
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,130
Huya Squad ambushed
the warriors and volunteers

177
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,760
just to hunt the moon wolf?

178
00:16:59,130 --> 00:16:59,630
Yeah.

179
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,060
Their locator is in its body.

180
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,400
It's probably them.

181
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,230
Alas.

182
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,590
They must be mad as their prey was gone.

183
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,180
Hump!

184
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,830
They're lucky enough.

185
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:14,560
When we get back, let's report this to
the Security Bureau and make them pay.

186
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,560
Can't find them.
Where are they?

187
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,260
We won't find them.

188

Chen, what are you yelling about?

193
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,260
You took our prey and now
are showing off your arrogance here !

194
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,360
No one seems to have
taught you about karma.

195
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,400
Let's start with you.

196
