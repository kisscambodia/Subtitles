(Based on the novel "Swallowed Star".)

25

(Previously on Swallowed Star)
(Your bullets never hit me.)

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,650
(Ultrasonic device.)

27
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,430
(No need to worry.)

28
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,900
(We'll work together.)

29
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,400
(Someone plots against you.)

30
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,120
(He probably holds
grudges against Huya Squad.)

31
00:02:36,267 --> 00:02:38,933
(Ah)

32
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,140
(Our mission is)

33
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,600
(to kill an iron dragon,
an advanced beast general.)

34
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,970
(And that egg)

35
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,090
(must be destroyed before it hatches.)

36
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,960
=Episode 16=

37
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,780
It's the sound of the iron dragon.

38
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,640
It has just laid eggs
but is still powerful.

39
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,810
The tougher part is the elite
monsters under its charge.

40
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,070
Two of them are fire triffids pigs,
the primary beast generals.

41
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,530
They are top ones among pig monsters.

42
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,400
Looks like it'd be a bitter fighting.

43
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,430
But it's a shame that

44
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,790
the egg of the iron dragon
will surely be destroyed.

45
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,200
Yeah, if we can get the egg,

46
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,870
we can turn it over
to some scientific institutions.

47
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:40,680
I heard there's one in Jingdu base city
that does researches on this.

48
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,320
(Jingdu base city.)

49
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:48,340
We'd kill the iron dragon first
and try our best to get the egg.

50
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,570
Let's do it.

51
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:14,780
Don't get held up by the herd.
Go straight to its lair!

52
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:15,930
Got it.

53
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:40,000
Sure enough, it gave up on the fight
in the liar to protect the egg.

54
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,960
I'll handle the iron dragon!

55
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,920
You take care of the
two fire triffids pigs.

56
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,710
OK.

57
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,850
(They're fighting.)

58
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,810
(Master Li is very quick when dodging.)

59
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,630
(He's perfect on the
Micro Bodily Movement.)

60
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,420
(No, it's definitely better than that.)

61
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,930
(They are indeed
advanced beast generals.)

62
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,510
(At least 20 meters in length.)

63
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,160
(More than any monster
I've ever fought before.)

64
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,340
(Master Wang is even stronger.)

65
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,770
Bastard! Prepare to die!

66
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,860
(The power of advanced
beast general's hit)

67
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,900
(is at least 250,000 kilos or more.
He'll lose if he keeps defending.)

68
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,660
(Master Wang could be in danger.)

69
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,460
(They can take advantages
of the environment and monsters around.)

70
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,330
(Their control over the fight is
better than mine.)

71
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:07,000
(The two of them and monsters
have been at each other's throats.)

72
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,330
(Right! If the egg is destroyed,
and the iron dragon will be sad,)

73
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,420
(they'll have a better chance.)

74
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,530
=Swallowed Star=

75
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,810
Hi, brother. How are you doing?

76
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,240
I'm fine. How about our parents?

77
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,420
Is everything okay in the neighborhood?

78
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,040
Mom and dad are fine.
But there's one thing.

79
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,920
Zhang Ke came by yesterday.

80
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:18,480
He said he found a guy
snooping around our neighborhood.

81
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,740
He and Chen Gu who just
returned to the base city

82
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,510
grabbed him and took him
to the Security Bureau.

83
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,480
When leaving, they asked us to come
to them if anything happens.

84
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,010
Brother. Is there something
going on over there?

85
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,530
The wilderness is as usual.

86
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,170
There's always something unsettling.
I'm just trying to make you safe.

87
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,650
Oh, by the way, brother.

88
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,800
I recently made a fortune in stocks.

89
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,840
Thanks to the money you gave me.

90
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,400
It's nothing.

91
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,420
I'll keep funding you. Just go ahead.

92
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,490
Make enough money and get married soon.

93
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,300
Nan's a freshman.
It's too early for that.

94
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,960
And I'm disabled.

95
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:10,050
Remember, Luo Hua.
Never call yourself disabled.

96
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,090
You may be disabled,
but you're not good-for-nothing.

97
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,630
I'll keep that in mind, brother.

98
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,150
I'm going back on mission.

99
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,600
OK, brother, be careful out
there in the wildness.

100
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:44,130
(This monster lair looks
like an old shopping mall.)

101
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,130
(There are about 70 beast officers
guarding the main gate.)

102
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:50,120
(I'm afraid only God of War can breach
from the front)

103
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,320
(and fight them.)

104
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,640
(Only elite monsters)

105
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,870
(can live on the third floor)

106
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,300
(to the fifth floor.)

107
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,670
(The iron dragon probably lives
on the first and second floor.)

108
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,970
(That's why it
didn't let other monsters in.)

109
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,400
(If I go in through the windows
of first and second floor)

110
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,470
(and get caught, I'd be doomed.)

111
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,640
(And there are a lot of monsters
on the third to the fifth floors.)

112
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,640
(How do I get in there
and find the egg?)

113
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,420
(Right! The elevator well
in this building)

114
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,220
(is a pass-through!)

115
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,720
(This is it.)

116
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,430
(There's a special patrol
unit guarding it.)

117
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,100
(Smells bad!)

118
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,970
(Iron dragon's egg.)

119
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,890
(The safest way to eliminate the threat)

120
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,660
(is to destroy the egg
immediately.)

121
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,610
(But if I give the egg
to a research institution,)

122
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,320
(it'd be more valuable.)

123
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,550
(I have to leave now!)

124
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,750
(The material must come from
an outfit of God of War.)

125
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,340
(Maybe the iron dragon
killed a God of War)

126
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,370
(and then collected
his outfit as a trophy.)

127
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,450
(He was killed in the wildness. I should
take his things back to the base city.)

128
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,130
Oh, no, the iron dragon's gone mad.

129
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,930
(They found me.)

130
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,490
(So many of them.)

131
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,280
(Come on!)

132
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,460
(Back then,)

133
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,570
(I've taken into account
all the 21 beast officers.)

134
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,970
(Is this the perfect level
that is one level higher than)

135
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,100
(Micro Bodily Movement?)

136
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,640
(Fire triffids pig,
primary beast general.)

137
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,570
(Top of the pig monsters.)

138
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,080
(There are
red flakes all over the body.)

139
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,330
(Big head with three crooked, pointy,
forward facing horns.)

140
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,330
(Vicious and dangerous.)

141
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,650
(Iron dragon, advanced beast general.)

142
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,150
(A very special race of monsters.
Covered in deep blue scales.)

143
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,460
(Five meters tall, ten meters long, with
a curved Black Unicorn on forehead.)

144
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,830

defense, mind and body structure.)

181
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,940
(A better genius than me)

182
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,560
