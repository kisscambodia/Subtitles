(Based on the novel "Swallowed Star".)

25

(Previously on Swallowed Star)
(Meet our new recruit, Luo Feng.)

26
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,220
(Go get it.)

27
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,060
(Xu Xin, why is she...)

28
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,050
(She's also on the rescue list.)

29
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,050
(Get ready to fight.)

30
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,920
(There's a big monster coming!)

31
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,780
(There are many monsters in the county.)

32
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,290
(It'd be hard for
them to survive the siege.)

33
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,180
It's time to hunt.

34
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,770
Let's go, let's hide in the building.

35
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,320
=Episode 9=

36
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,160
Captain.

37
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,360
Go. I'll cover you.

38
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:53,500
We should believe in him.
Our priority is to keep her safe.

39
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,840
Primary beast officer,
two-tailed ocelot.

40
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,320
I'll be your opponent!

41
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:28,020
(Found you.
Captain of Fire Hammer Team, Gao Feng)

42
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:33,480
(Li Xiao, Zhang Zehu,
Pan Ya, Tietou, Dong, One-eye)

43
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,070
Gao Feng is strong.

44
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,000
He's got good strength,

45
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,330
which is as good as
an intermediate senior warrior.

46
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,910
He is a bit slow, but he's still
as fast as primary senior warriors.

47
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,650
Gao Feng's here, meaning the rest of
the team members are nearby.

48
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,720
I think they're hiding in that building.

49
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,120
Captain, Gao Feng is something.

50
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,820
That rookie, Luo Feng,

51
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,820
is better than I thought.

52
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:12,270
If we let him grow,
he'll bring us trouble.

53
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,740
Hump. Why don't we seize
this opportunity and kill Gao Feng?

54
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,260
His team will descend into
chaos following his death,

55
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:22,290
and that will be the time we
take them down.

56
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,750
I'm afraid that might expose us.

57
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,810
Captain, this is a rare opportunity.

58
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,390
The Fire Hammer Team
rescued the survivor.

59
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:37,680
If we let them go, there's a good
chance it'll lead back to us.

60
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:40,520
We'd better finish them off now.

61
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,950
I know your grudge
against Luo Feng. Don't worry.

62
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,830
I won't let him go.

63
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,630
But we can't act recklessly right now.

64
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,330
Xu Xin, stay close.

65
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,620
All these are low-level monsters.
Let's go up, it'd be safer

66
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,340
as there's no sign there.

67
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,060
The battle begins.

68
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,380
(There are 32 of them left now.)

69
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:35,690
(Tiger mastiff is not dangerous alone,
but works well as a team.)

70
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,840
(We must kill them as soon as possible,
or they might hurt Xu Xin.)

71
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,380
Luo Feng!

72
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,020
(I didn't see him
take out his sabre at all.)

73
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,850
(It's his first fight,
yet he's improved a lot.)

74
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,900
(Damn, it's 33 of them.)

75
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,230
Xu Xin, are you all right?

76
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,610
I'm good, you...

77
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:25,250
Luo Feng, I didn't know you could use fly-cutters.

78
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,980
I'm still practicing.
I dare not use it in combats.

79
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:33,870
(I'd better keep it a secret for now
that I'm a Spirit Master.)

80
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,030
Let's go.

81
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,200
(It's a trap.)

82
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,810
(The fiercer the attack is, the less
attention they will pay to the defense.)

83
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,760
(I'm stronger than a two-tailed ocelot.)

84
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,580
(But my speed is slower.)

85
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,060
(Looks like I need
more training on that.)

86
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,830
Gao Feng wins. He is something.

87
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:44,010
Captain, we could use him as the bait.

88
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:47,960
Right. If Gao Feng
fights that old monster,

89
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,180
he will surely die,

90
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,100
but that old monster
will be badly injured.

91
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,970
Then we can

92
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,250
take advantage of it.

93
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,000
=Swallowed Star=

94
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,530
No monsters are coming.

95
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,290
Should we go help the Captain?

96
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,820
No. Two-tailed ocelot is just
a primary beast officer.

97
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,010
It won't hurt the Captain.

98
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,680
You had been trapped in the wilderness
without water for so long,

99
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,820
thank god you survived.

100
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,540
Xu Xin, how come you
joined the volunteer team?

101
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,860
We're working on RR Virus Blocker.

102
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,700
RR Virus Blocker?

103
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,650
My college tutor is a bioengineer.

104
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,740
He recently developed
the RR Virus Blocker.

105
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,540
The tests were successful.

106
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:31,090
But we had to come here
to get the data to see

107
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,120
if it works on monsters.

108
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,610
It's too dangerous. You could have

109
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,600
trusted the warriors to do it.

110
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,560
A team of warriors
was with us to keep us safe.

111
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,900
The thing is we
have to collect the data on site.

112
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:56,300
My tutor, my classmates,
and the warriors...

113
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,640
They didn't die in vain.

114
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,000
Someone uses the volunteer team and
injured warriors as a bait

115
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,770
to drain the power of
the advanced monsters

116
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,810
and finally kill them.

117
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,930
It's dirty!

118
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:17,390
Whoever it is, we'll come after them.

119
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,770
They have yet to give it up.

120
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,940
I'm sure the beast they are after
didn't show up yet.

121
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,200
Why do they have to go through

122
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,450
so much trouble to set
a trap to hunt a monster?

123
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,650
It's got to be a strong and smart one.

124
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,140
It must be a beast officer
or even above that.

125
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,140
Prearranged ambush site

126
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,520
and the ultrasonic devices.

127
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:45,950
Looks like they've used this dirty trick
to their advantage many times.

128
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:49,170
Probably, they are also
a warrior's team.

129
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,780
A corrupt and depraved one.

130
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,410
(Huya Squad)

131
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,410
(returns to the warrior supply base)

132
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,060
(from 0201, too)

133
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,220
(Maybe...)

134
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:03,450
Captain, you can have whoever you want

135
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,530
but I'll deal with Luo Feng.

136
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,610
You're so angry with him?

137
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,090
Just a rookie who doesn't
know what he's doing.

138
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,890
But he embarrassed me many times.

139
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,440
He won't know what I'm capable of

140
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,850
if I don't teach him a lesson.

141
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,160
What's your plan, bro?

142
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,730
I'll cut his limbs and
leave him stranded.

143
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:31,180
And then I'll have the tiger mastiffs
eat him up piece by piece.

144
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,810
I'll make him regret messing with me.

145
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,500
Alright, just don't forget our business.

146
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,820
I won't.

147
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:46,460
Advanced beast officer,
the hunter, moon wolf.

148
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:52,430
It's worth a lot more than
the Fire Hammer Team.

149
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:55,600
We still don't know
who injured that old monster.

150
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,520
Li Xiao, save the last bullet for me.

151
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,110
I'm not a bad shooter.

152
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,560
You do hate Luo Feng a lot.

153
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,700
No problem. The rocket projectile is
self-navigated.

154
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,140
You won't miss him.

155
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,380
How's it going?

156
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:24,360
It's all set.
Let's wait for them to take the bait.

157
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,760
They're out.

158
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,000
Captain.

159
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,510
Other monsters will be here soon.

160
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,180
We need to leave as soon as possible.

161
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,810
(Captain is safe and sound after
a fight with a beast officer.)

162
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,300
Should we continue the investigation

163
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,970
into who's after all this?

164
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:58,060
We must do, but let's focus on
the mission right now.

165
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,410
We can't afford any
more unnecessary casualties.

166
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,530
All casualties are necessary.

167
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,650
Your death will bring us money.

168
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,280
Target locked. Ready to fire.

169
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,710
I'm good to go, too.
I'll blow his leg in one shot.

170
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,440
Very good.

171
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,640
(What's that noise?)

172
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,160
Captain.

173
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,560
Luo Feng!

174
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,600
(Dry cleaning)

175
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:14,990
Zhang Ke.

176
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,300
Zhang Ke.

177
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,260
Zhang Ke.

178
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,450
Get inside the building.

179
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,230
You have nowhere to hide!

180
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,140
Xu Xin.

181
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,160
I'm... I'm here.

182
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,190
The route of retreat has been cut off.

183
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,240
Huya Squad.

184
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,740
They found us. Go!

185
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,240
Don't worry.

186
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:19,250
The black snake, wild bull
and the iron scorpion!

187
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,210
All of them are beast officers.

188
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,070
(So many beast officers.)

189
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,670
