Luo Feng,
I heard you want to be a warrior?

47
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,072
To be honest, me, too.

48
00:03:45,072 --> 00:03:48,112
It's just that I'm much closer to
this goal than you are.

49
00:03:48,112 --> 00:03:49,248
What do you mean?

50
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,488
It's easy. I also want to be a warrior.

51
00:03:53,488 --> 00:03:55,472

52
00:03:55,744 --> 00:03:59,280

need someone to be my sparring.

54
00:04:04,032 --> 00:04:05,760
So are they.

55
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,784
Well, Zhang Haobai?

56
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:14,288
Those two are also our senior students?

57
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,608
What about that kid?

58
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:21,936
It seems that we don't have his data.

59
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,816
They want to be a warrior, too.

60
00:04:24,816 --> 00:04:28,176
You can have a friendly competition.

61
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:29,634
Ah!

62
00:04:31,616 --> 00:04:33,552
I'd love to.

63
00:04:33,552 --> 00:04:36,912
That's fast.
It should be 25 meters per second.

64
00:04:36,912 --> 00:04:38,928

Don't worry, mom.

102
00:07:28,016 --> 00:07:29,648
You know he's good.

103
00:07:29,648 --> 00:07:32,944
Feng, which college you want to apply?

104
00:07:32,944 --> 00:07:35,248
Dad, with my grades, I think

105
00:07:35,648 --> 00:07:37,488
I can apply for
Jiangnan No.1 Military Academy.

If I become the key person to be trained
by the country,

107

we can get a house.

108
00:07:41,872 --> 00:07:45,312
That's good. Mom and dad don't
have to sleep on the couch every night.

109

Feng, we know you are thoughtful.

110
00:07:47,888 --> 00:07:49,744
But it's your wish to be a warrior.

111
00:07:49,744 --> 00:07:53,936
The rich go to martial clubs,
and we can't afford it.

112
00:07:54,688 --> 00:07:56,336
Dad, don't say that.

113
00:07:56,336 --> 00:07:57,840
Although we are not rich,

114
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,320
you always give Hua and me
whatever you have.

115
00:08:00,752 --> 00:08:02,528
I never feel I'm worse than anyone.

116
00:08:02,528 --> 00:08:05,600

Take care.

125
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,744

126
00:08:58,272 --> 00:09:00,928

00:09:19,936 --> 00:09:21,968
I'm running out of time.
I can't be late.

131

Boy, we have no grudge against you.

132
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,544
But you have offended the wrong people.

133
00:09:30,544 --> 00:09:31,824
We don't want to give you a hard time.

134
00:09:31,968 --> 00:09:34,592
Leave your right hand here,
and we'll let you go.

135
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,560
My right hand is used for writing,
as well as beating dogs.

136
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,232
Come on!

137
00:09:43,232 --> 00:09:44,720
Boy, you're doomed.

138

If they are the normal gangsters,

140
00:10:05,456 --> 00:10:08,208
they would have left in
this kind of situation.

141
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,288
They are not here to fight.

142
00:10:12,992 --> 00:10:15,536
Why hasn't Feng come yet?
The exam will start soon.

143

Looks like they made it.

149

158
00:11:41,104 --> 00:11:43,024
I witnessed everything.

159
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,584
He's late for a reason.

160
00:11:45,584 --> 00:11:50,432
Besides, it wasn't past 15 minutes
when he reached.

161
00:11:50,432 --> 00:11:51,840
I saw it clearly.

162
00:11:52,304 --> 00:11:53,840
Of course.

163
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,864

as well as the instructor of

170
00:12:09,088 --> 00:12:09,856
Thank you.

171
00:12:14,528 --> 00:12:16,528

172
00:12:17,264 --> 00:12:19,200
But do you think
you are totally safe now?

173

174

175

I didn't.

176
00:12:30,736 --> 00:12:31,680

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,224
What are you doing?

183
00:12:43,568 --> 00:12:44,368
Ah!

184
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:47,728
(Thought without learning is perilous)
Oh, I'm so sorry, Mr. Luo Feng.

185
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,664
I didn't mean it.

186
00:12:49,664 --> 00:12:50,464
You!

187
00:12:50,464 --> 00:12:52,800
All of you go back to your seats.

188
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,912
But teacher, my test paper...

189
00:12:55,104 --> 00:12:56,992
What happened has happened.

190
00:12:56,992 --> 00:12:58,624
Hurry and finish your paper.

191
00:12:58,624 --> 00:12:59,488
But...

192
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:09,232
(There's still time for me.)

193
00:13:09,232 --> 00:13:11,392
There are 10 minutes left.
Remember to check your paper.

194
00:13:11,744 --> 00:13:14,096
Two more questions, I still have time.

195
00:13:15,232 --> 00:13:16,704
Five minutes left.

196
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:28,144
There's still time, I...

197
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,064
-What's wrong with you, Feng?
-Luo Feng!

198
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:41,504
Haobai, you did well
in the exam this time.

199
00:13:41,504 --> 00:13:43,808
One more step further to
become a warrior.

200
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,496
Dad, my goal is to be
an elite warrior like uncle.

201
00:13:48,496 --> 00:13:50,624
Good. Ambitious!

202
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,040
Bro, if he passes the test for
warrior-to-be during college,

203
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,312
I will get him into our Huya team.

204
00:13:57,312 --> 00:14:00,288
Thank you, uncle.
I'm sure I'll pass the test.

205
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,336
Haobai, I heard that a good student with
good grades in your school

206
00:14:04,336 --> 00:14:06,224
fainted during the exam?

207
00:14:06,224 --> 00:14:07,936
It's Luo Feng.

208
00:14:07,936 --> 00:14:11,232
He thinks he has good skills and grades,

209
00:14:11,456 --> 00:14:13,152
and never respects me.

210
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,928
He deserved it.

211
00:14:28,336 --> 00:14:30,096
Luo Feng, you're awake.

212
00:14:30,096 --> 00:14:32,896
Xu Xin, you...

213
00:14:33,504 --> 00:14:35,936
You fainted
during the exam the other day,

214
00:14:35,936 --> 00:14:38,976
I'm here to visit you on behalf of
the student union.

215
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,624
Thank you for

216
00:14:46,256 --> 00:14:47,408
what happened earlier.

217
00:14:47,408 --> 00:14:49,296
Never mind.

218
00:14:49,696 --> 00:14:53,472
By the way, your parents have stayed for
three days, and they went back just now.

219
00:14:53,472 --> 00:14:55,872
Really? I've been in a coma for so long?

220
00:14:55,872 --> 00:14:58,800
Luo Feng, you've been in a coma long.
Come and have food.

221
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,024
What about an apple for you?

222
00:15:01,216 --> 00:15:01,888
You!

223
00:15:02,176 --> 00:15:02,992
Luo Feng.

224
00:15:02,992 --> 00:15:04,336
Calm down.

225
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,896
Failing in the examination is nothing.

226
00:15:06,896 --> 00:15:10,656
Your health is the most important thing.
You can take it again next year.

227
00:15:10,656 --> 00:15:12,896
Yes, your health is the most important.

228
00:15:14,544 --> 00:15:15,632
Have some.

229
00:15:19,648 --> 00:15:22,592
I didn't know you are quite close.

230
00:15:22,592 --> 00:15:23,760
Of course.

231
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,264
Besides,
schoolmates should help each other.

232
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,832
Humph.
Thank you so much, President Zhang.

233
00:15:31,984 --> 00:15:35,040
Oh, Xu Xin. We need to deal with
handover procedures of student union.

234
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:37,040
I think it's about time.

235
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,400
Now that Luo Feng is awake,
let's visit him another day.

236
00:15:40,752 --> 00:15:43,696
Okay then. Luo Feng, I'm leaving.

237
00:15:43,904 --> 00:15:45,068
Take care.

238
00:16:01,467 --> 00:16:04,767
(Yi'an No.3 High School)

239
00:16:06,352 --> 00:16:07,616
(Today, the exam result comes out.)

240
00:16:08,288 --> 00:16:11,536
(I missed two questions, but...)

241
00:16:11,536 --> 00:16:12,976
Feng, here!

242
00:16:17,872 --> 00:16:20,112
Don't be nervous. You'll be fine.

243
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,056
I'm there. What about you?

244
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,264
Did you see?

245
00:16:29,264 --> 00:16:29,633
Am I there?

246
00:16:29,633 --> 00:16:30,064
(Jiangnan No.2 Military Academy)
Am I there?

247
00:16:30,064 --> 00:16:30,333
(Jiangnan No.2 Military Academy)

248
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,168
(Jiangnan No.1 Military Academy)

249
00:16:31,168 --> 00:16:31,567
(Jiangnan No.1 Military Academy)
I made it!

250
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:32,896
I made it!

251
00:16:33,433 --> 00:16:33,967
(Jiangnan University)

252
00:16:34,016 --> 00:16:35,904
No...

253
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,512
Your griping power is at least 300 kg.

254
00:16:48,512 --> 00:16:52,016
And hitting power might be over 900 kg.

255
00:16:52,016 --> 00:16:54,112
You are... Instructor Jiang.

256
00:16:54,496 --> 00:16:58,528
Sorry. You helped me so much.
But I still failed.

257
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,768
Don't be discouraged.
You'll have a better opportunity.

258
00:17:02,768 --> 00:17:04,416
The other day,

259
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:07,488
I saw you fight those
three senior martial club students,

260
00:17:07,488 --> 00:17:10,512
your hitting power was about 800 kg.

261
00:17:10,512 --> 00:17:13,360
In just a few days,
it actually exceeded 900 kg.

262
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,992
It's unbelievable!

263
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:19,408
In other words,
you are now as good as a warrior-to-be.

264
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,368
Warrior-to-be?

265
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,648
It's the first step towards
becoming a warrior.

266
00:17:23,648 --> 00:17:25,040
Unlike the college entrance examination,

267
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,336
there is no threshold for the test.

268
00:17:28,336 --> 00:17:30,624
It's held
at the beginning of each month.

269
00:17:30,896 --> 00:17:34,592
As long as you pass
the test and the Field Test,

270
00:17:34,592 --> 00:17:36,384
you will be awarded the title of warrior

271
00:17:36,384 --> 00:17:39,680
and become a real warrior.

272
00:17:41,056 --> 00:17:45,632
However,
there are other requirements, too.

273
00:17:45,968 --> 00:17:48,496
Only after actual testing
can we find out about it.

274
00:17:48,752 --> 00:17:51,488
But you should have a good chance.

275
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:52,272
Really?

276
00:17:52,928 --> 00:17:54,640
(If I can become a warrior,)

277
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,224
(the welfare provided by the country)

278
00:17:56,224 --> 00:17:58,368
(will let parents and Hua
live a good life.)

279
00:17:59,248 --> 00:18:01,520
(Dad doesn't have to work hard
every day)

280
00:18:01,888 --> 00:18:05,072
(and Hua could study Finance.)

281
00:18:05,392 --> 00:18:06,848
(I will sign up for)

282
00:18:08,608 --> 00:18:09,664

319
00:20:29,745 --> 00:20:30,625
Here...

320
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:31,441
Stop!

321
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:33,361

I'll show you
