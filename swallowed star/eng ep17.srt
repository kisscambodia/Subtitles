(Based on the novel "Swallowed Star".)

25
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,780
(Previously on Swallowed Star)
(It had just laid egg)

26
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,880
(Previously on Swallowed Star)
(and is still powerful.)

27
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,250
(Looks like it'd be a bitter fighting.)

28
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,080
(Brother. Anything going on over there?)

29
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,560
(I'm just trying to
make sure you're safe.)

30
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,970
(It gave up the fight in the liar)

31
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,760
(to protect the egg.)

32
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,100
(We'd kill the iron dragon first.)

33
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,600
(But giving the egg to
a research institution)

34
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,040
(would be more valuable.)

35
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,260
(The advanced beast general
is really something.)

36
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,260
(It is stronger than any monster
I've ever fought before.)

37
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,930
=Episode 17=

38
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,020
Oh, no. The iron dragon's gone mad.

39
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,270
Hum. Try to escape?

40
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,280
Get out of here!

41
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,160
Go.

42
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,580
I don't think they will just let us go.

43
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,300
Something must have
happened to its lair.

44
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,120
That's why it's in such
a hurry to get back.

45
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,330
The only thing that
would make it so anxious

46
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,780
is the egg.

47
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,000
Let's take care of the enemies here.

48
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,640
(The iron dragon!)

49
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,910
(Right in time.)

50
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,440
(Its tail is 11 meters long.
It can't hit me from there.)

51
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,060
(56 centimeters short.)

52
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,120
(Damn it.)

53
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,190
(It has reached its maximum height.)

54
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:56,670
(It hasn't given up yet! Advanced beast
generals have good eyesight.)

55
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,720
(Even if I fly to two to three
kilometers above the sea level,)

56
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,300
(it can still see me as long as
there are no obstacles.)

57
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,060
(I have to break through the clouds.)

58
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,120
(I'm such an idiot!)

59
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,950
(The sky above city 003)

60
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,360
(is full of flying monsters.)

61
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,480
(I'd die if I have to deal with
the flying monsters)

62
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,690
(up here.)

63
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,910
(Damn it.)

64
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,767
(If I go down fast,
I'll hit iron dragon for sure.)

65
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,250
(If I slow down, the flying
monsters will catch me.)

66
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,630
(It's now or never!)

67
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,330
(The injury is getting worse.)

68
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,360
(The residential building
could cover me up.)

69
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,490
(I can hide in the underground garage.)

70
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,210
(I don't think the iron
dragon would find me.)

71
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,890
(The iron dragon is commanding
the herds around to hunt me down.)

72
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:26,220
(It's impossible to stay
here until I recover from the wound.)

73
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,370
(But it's okay.)

74
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,720
(I forgot when I was
escaping the hunting)

75
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,150
(that there are many
subway tunnels in this city.)

76
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,150
(The tunnel is small.)

77
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,120
(The iron dragon can't get in.)

78
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,080
(I sought far
and neglected what lied close at hand.)

79
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,950
(That almost killed me.)

80
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,490
(Lucky me.)

81
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,100
(There's a tunnel not far from here.)

82
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,030
I didn't expect there's another
master hiding in the shadow.

83
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,060
He stole the egg
while we were fighting the iron dragon.

84
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,040
No wonder it was so
desperate and ran away.

85
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,540
Now there's nothing left in its lair.

86
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,720
Two fire triffids pigs were killed.

87
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,410
All the other monsters have fled.

88
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,400
If the mystic master
joined forces with us,

89
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,970
we would kill that iron
dragon more easily.

90
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,810
Everyone has his own ambition.

91
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,230
He's been able to escape

92
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,820
from so many beast officers,

93
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,960
and he stole the egg.

94
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,760
He must be

95
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,560
as strong as an intermediate God of War.

96
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,720
Wang, then we...

97
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,080
We hurt the iron dragon.

98
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,970
It ran like hell for the egg.

99
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,970
Its injury will definitely get worse.

100
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,050
Let's follow the trail and investigate.

101
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,810
It won't escape.

102
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,950
OK.

103
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:01,000
Young Master's training is
not yet fulfilled.

104
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,700
But his strength has improved a lot.

105
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,060
Still far from what my dad wants to see.

106
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,560
My parents are both Gods of War.

107
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,240
Of course I'm good.

108
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,850
By the way, Pan Ya.

109
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:17,470
You said Luo Feng is 19 years old,

110
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,680
but he's a primary senior warrior?

111
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,050
How could he compare with you?

112
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,810
Our Huya Squad won't
get peace of mind until he's dead!

113
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,560
Now I'm the only one left in the team.

114
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,400
I'll kill him myself sooner or later.

115
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,530
(Thunder Team!)

116
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:11,200
=Swallowed Star=

117
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,520
Luo Feng!

118
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:30,590
I've been looking for you everywhere.

119
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,960
Good that I find you here.

120
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:39,960
Ah, it's Luo Feng. I've seen you before.

121
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,580
(Captain of Huya Squad.)

122
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,510
(Pan Ya wants to kill me.
If these three weren't here,)

123
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:51,610
(he'd be a piece of cake.
But those three...)

124
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:55,240
(The old man and the big white guy
are both advanced senior warriors.)

125
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,220
(Li Wei isn't strong enough,)

126
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,450
(but his background is terrifying.)

127
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:06,010
Sir, this captain has a grudge
against Fire Hammer Team.

128
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,440
And you can see what he's about to do.

129
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,820
Our state has laws

130
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,960
that forbid warriors to kill each other.

131
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,760
I'm not asking you to stop him.

132
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:18,330
But please stay out of this.

133
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,600
(As long as the three stay out of it,
I should be able to...)

134
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
Now you are begging for mercy.

135
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,320
Oh dear.

136
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,060
When you grabbed the two-headed
black snake from us with the Indians,

137
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,930
you never expected this, did you?

138
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,480
I was holding a grudge
against the Huya Squad,

139
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,340
and didn't pay attention to the
interests of the whole. Can you...

140
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:41,580
The two-headed black snake
is not a rare material.

141
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,900
Normally, I wouldn't even be interested.

142
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:49,850
But it's unforgivable
that you humiliated me.

143
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,630
Wei.

144
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:55,980
Shut up. You're not qualified
to call him like that.

145
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,980
As the son of God of War,

146
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,690
I have all the materials I need.

147
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,790
But what I really like to collect

148
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,030
is the human skulls.

149
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:12,490
Especially those known
as the "gifted" juvenile warriors.

150
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,480
I've killed a few of
the gifted like you.

151
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:25,740
After all, I don't want to see a
genius better than me.

152
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:32,410
You have no idea how interesting it is

153
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,390
to see a genius
genuflecting on his knees

154
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,280
with no dignity.

155
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,630
What's in your bag?

156
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:47,610
Two Gods of War, Li Kan and Wang
Tong were fighting

157
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,500
the iron dragon there.
The fight was fierce.

158
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:56,410
And you came out of the subway tunnel

159
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,210
connecting to the battlefield.

160
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,300
You snuck into iron dragon's lair
when they were fighting.

161
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,770
You came out of that tunnel in a panic,

162
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:10,220
and forgot to observe the
environment around you.

163
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,160
You must want to get back
to the base city soon.

164
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:19,710
What treasure did you
steal from its lair?

165
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:24,410
So you came here to be killed by us

166
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,470
with a nice present for us.

167
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,510
(What should I do?
I'll lose if I fight them.)

168
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:35,880
(But I'll be damned if I don't resist.)

169
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,390
(I'll take chance.)

170
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,560
Yes. The iron dragon's egg

171
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,260
is right inside my bag.

172
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,320
The iron dragon's egg?

173
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,040
I'm sure you're aware of
the value of the egg.

174
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,860
It's worth at least five billion

175
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:53,160
in the market, and
more in the black market.

176
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:02,270
(The old man and the big
white man are high in the rank,)

177
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:05,920
(but after all, five billion is a lot.)

178
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,060
(They will want it.)

179
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:11,960
Kill him and we'll split the money.

180
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:20,960
I don't care about the
money, but the egg...

181
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,540
They could be my trophy in city 003.

182
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,090
Do it.

183
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,900
Then come and get it!

184
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,230
You want to split the money? Go to die!

185
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,460
There's a hidden weapon in your bag!

186
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:27,040
You plotted against an advanced
senior warrior like Cullen.

187
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,040
Not bad!

188
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:34,670
But the same trick won't work on me!

189
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,130
You're wrong about one thing.

190
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,850
There is no hidden weapon in my bag.

191
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,850
No?

192
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,830
More?

193
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:57,130
You're a Spirit Master!

194
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,740
You're quite vigilant.

195
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,480
I couldn't knock you out
at close range.

196
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,300
So I have to strike a fatal blow

197
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,300
when you thought you got it all.

198
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,040
You...

199
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:18,440
I won't kill you since
you didn't come at me.

200
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,440
What's that look?
Is it sympathy for the weak?

201
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,840
No, I'm a genius. I'm the strong one!

202
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,370
There's no better genius than me!

203
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:36,430
So, I must kill you!

204
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,800
I'm better than you!
Don't feel sorry for me!

205
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:47,920
The noise of the battle should have
alerted the surrounding monsters.

206
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,630
I'm going to kill you, Luo Feng!

207
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,200
Ah!

208
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,500
(003 City Mall, a shopping center
built by humans in the old world.)

209
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,000
(It's now the liar of the iron dragon.
There are five floors.)

210
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,600
(The iron dragon occupies two floors.)

211
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,560
(The other three are inhabited
by its elite monsters.)

212
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,500
(The iron dragon egg, laid by the iron
dragon living in the 003 city mall.)

213
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,000
(It's cyan with subtle patterns.
Great value of scientific research.)

214
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,560
(It's worth 5 billion in the black market.)

(Based on the novel "Swallowed Star".)

(Next episode)
(Bastard!)

246
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,900
(I won't let him off!)

247
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:28,450
(Recently, nine warriors
have been killed in city 003.)

248
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:31,500
(I'm sure the murderer
has friends and family!)

249
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,870
(Your powers can be unleashed
beyond these walls.)

250
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:36,250
(But people here envy you.)

251
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:41,490
(That's right. Let him live in
fear of betrayal all day long!)

252
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,780
(You're alone in the wilderness.)

253
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,990
(Luo Feng, something bad happened.)

254
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,190
(Hua, he's in trouble.)
