(Help me prepare a warplane.)

26
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,820
(And find where Luo Feng is.)

27
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,920
(Give me an hour and I'll bring
Luo Feng here.)

28
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,360
(I'll always remember
I was part of the Fire Hammer Team.)

29
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,040
(There are the most talented students
in the world.)

30
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,660
(The best teachers, the best equipment.)

31
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,400
(It's known as the world's
top one training camp.)

32
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,400
(It's called)

33
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,300
(Elite Training Camp.)

34
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,600
=Episode 21=

35
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:06,270
Elite Training Camp is the top
warriors training camp in the world.

36
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:11,050
It has a more widely known name
among the warriors,

37
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,640
War of God Preparatory Camp.

38
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,440
Ah.

39
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,450
War of God Preparatory Camp, then...

40
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,720
Yes, 90% warriors in Elite Training Camp

41
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,450
will be the Gods of War.

42
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,910
90%!

43
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:27,400
Another 10% were disabled or died.

44
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,550
It is not a place for fun.

45
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,280
It offers the best teaching.

46
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,390
Students also have to endure
the hardest training.

47
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,010
OK.

48
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,210
Even so,

49
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,460
There are still countless people
trying to get in.

50
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,640
You know,

51
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,760
every quota
in the Elite Training Camp is priceless.

52
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:51,000
Even the consortium can't buy a quota

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,430
with their connections and money.

54
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,630
Luo Feng, you have the chance

55
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,530
to enter the world's top training camp.

56
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,980
But on one condition,
you have to pass the B-level test.

57
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,980
B-level, that means...

58
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:10,780
Actually, A-level test would do.

59
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,670
But just now,

60
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,580
Hanxia military asked for one quota from

61
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,990
Extreme Martial Club.

62
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,180
That's why you have to take the
B-level test, which is harder.

63
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,920
Luo Feng, are you willing to take it

64
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,920
to join Elite Training Camp?

65
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,270
Yes.

66
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:28,750
OK.

67
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,990
Good, but don't stress out.

68
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,500
Even if you fail the B-level test,
you will enter the basic training camp.

69
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,370
All right, let's go. The test will be
conducted directly at headquarters.

70
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,020
Before that, go home and say goodbye
to your relatives and friends.

71
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,640
Within five years in Elite Training Camp,

72
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,930
you only get a 2-month holiday each year.

73
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,490
Director Zhuge.

74
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,680
He is Heng Xia?

75
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:21,740
Yes.

76
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,730
A young warrior from the Extreme Martial
Club for basic training camp this year.

77
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,400
He's a genius, too.

78
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,960
Heng Xia, this is your senior, Luo Feng.

79
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,930
He will go to the global headquarters of
Extreme Martial Club with you this time.

80
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,240
Your senior's goal is
Elite Training Camp.

81
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,220
Ah!

82
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,320
Hello, senior. My name is Heng Xia.

83
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,450
Hello.

84
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,160
On March 28th,

85
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,560
you and I will fly to the global
headquarters of Extreme Martial Club.

86
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,980
You all have to

87
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,980
get to the airport before 2 p.m.

88
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,880
Yes.

89
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,970
(I've been here for so many years.)

90
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,920
(I'm leaving soon.)

91
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,250
(I'll leave the country
for the global headquarters.)

92
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,740
(Sigh, five years is long.)

93
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,480
(Dad, Mom)

94
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,670
(Hua.)

95
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,250
(I can't live with them
for five years.)

96
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,430
(And Wen, he should be
studying hard now.)

97
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,650
(The final exam is coming.)

98
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,830
(Xu Xin.)

99
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,850
We arrived, Mr. Luo Feng.

100
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,640
OK.

101
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,540
Ah.

102
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,000
Mom, Dad, I'm going out.

103
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,600
Hello.

104
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,580
No. No.

105
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,220
Take a look, please.

106
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,160
No.

107
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,800
No, thanks.

108
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,050
Wen.

109
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,400
Feng.

110
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,320
We meet once every half a year.
You're leaving again.

111
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,750
I have no choice.

112
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,440
The time of departure is nailed,
no change can be done.

113
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,320
Well, it's like you're not happy.

114
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,520
Elite Training Camp is the dream of
all warriors.

115
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,780
I have been in the Military Academy
for a semester.

116
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,680
I'm not as good as the senior students
in the martial club.

117
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,510
But you're heading towards
the God of War!

118
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,800
You want to be a warrior, too?

119
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,170
I knew that I was not talented enough,
so I went to the military academy first.

120
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,490
The resources there would
help me improve.

121
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,900
Ah, but even in school,

122
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,560
we still need to pay for
the expensive training facilities.

123
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,940
I have to work part-time to
earn extra money.

124
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,710
But there's less time for me to train.

125
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,160
Huh?

126
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,160
(Received a remittance of one million)

127
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,820
This... This money...

128
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,240
Wen, since you want to be a warrior,

129
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,620
you can't waste your time
on part-time jobs.

130
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,920
I can help you with the money problem.

131
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,250
Don't forget to pay me back
when you become a warrior.

132
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:20,970
Feng.

133
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,480
Well, I have another date
with Xu Xin. Goodbye.

134
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,680
I hope you will become a warrior soon!

135
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,470
Xu Xin... Oh, got it.

136
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,470
Come on, Feng!

137
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,130
=Swallowed Star=

138
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,740
Luo Feng!

139
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,520
Xu Xin.

140
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:36,590
Young Master, Xu Xin went out
with a boy I don't know.

141
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,920
His name seems to be Luo Feng.

142
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,510
How dare he!

143
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,510
You know what to do.

144
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:50,750
Young Master,
what about the things I want...

145
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,560
This year's latest limited-edition
branded bag.

146
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,600
It'll be on your desk when it's done.

147
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,720
OK. Young Master, I'll finish the task!

148
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:05,930
So... You're leaving at the end of
the month.

149
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:06,510
Yeah.

150
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,290
The world's top Elite Training Camp.

151
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,290
I heard about it from my grandfather.

152
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,800
You'll for sure be a God of War
since you get in.

153
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,990
Congratulates, future God of War.

154
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,980
You know, my new boyfriend

155
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,030
is handsome and rich,
and he's also a warrior.

156
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,100
A warrior! Impressive.

157
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,320
Oh, it's you.

158
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:46,200
We run into each other for 2 days.
It's fate calling!

159
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,000
Ah?

160
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,720
You got the wrong person, right?

161
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,150
How can it be? Didn't you say you
want to go shopping with me?

162
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,410
Eh.

163
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,420
Who is it?

164
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,410
The guy I just mentioned.

165
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,160
I think you have the wrong person.

166
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,830
My boyfriend just came back
from the wilderness yesterday.

167
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,720
How can you meet him two days in a row?

168
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,560
(Boyfriend!)

169
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,290
Well...

170
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,290
Oh, yes, yes.

171
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,960
I'm sorry. I got the wrong person.

172
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:24,120
You said boyfriend...

173
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,360
You...

174
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,350
Sorry.

175
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,730
Six months ago,
we were high school seniors,

176
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,120
standing on the border of the base city,

177
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:51,360
staring at the old world
that ordinary people can't set foot in

178
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,230
and discussing the future with
each other.

179
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,020
And you,

180
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,970
you have already taken the first step.

181
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,190
Now you will take the second step.

182
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,070
Is Elite Training Camp the second step?

183
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,630
I'm not in it yet.

184
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,000
I need to study for five years.

185
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,650
Except for the holidays
in January and February every year,

186
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:15,150
I can't leave the camp any other time.

187
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,220
OK.

188
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,060
I see.

189
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,720
But as long as they rate me
as good as the God of War,

190
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:22,960
I can apply to finish it earlier.

191
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,690
No.

192
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,970
This is not good.

193
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,950
There are the top teaching resources
in the world.

194
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,480
Even Hong and Thunder
sometimes teach there.

195
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,190
It's a rare opportunity!

196
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,350
You should study for 5 years.

197
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:37,840
But...

198
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,160
I'll be waiting for you.

199
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,400
(Extreme Martial Club)

200
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,200
(I was living there half a year ago)

201
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,960
(and training in the dim corridor,)

202
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,770
(living in a crowded room.)

203
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,110
You are Luo Feng?

204
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,920
Who are you?

205
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,820
My name is Wang Xingping,
from the Wang family in Jingdu.

206
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,120
I am here to warn you.

207
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,200
Stay away from Xu Xin.

208
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,850
Wang family in Jingdu.

209
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,960
Wang family, one of the nine
core families of HR Alliance.

210
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,690
Good. You are a smart guy.

211
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,840
A wise man should know the rules.

212
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,220
Rules?

213
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:53,150
You should know
that people are different in this world.

214
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:57,050
Some people can only abide by
the law and rules.

215
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,470
Even so,
disasters may come from the sky.

216
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,340
Some people can break the law,

217
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,840
murder and burn. And they'd be alright.

218
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,790
You should know
what kind of person I am,

219
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:15,660
and what kind of person you are.

220
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,860
That's right. We're different.

221
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:22,430
You swagger around with
your power.

222
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,750
I heard that you've only been a warrior
for more than half a year,

223
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,860
and you're a primary senior warrior now.

224
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,330
Well, my useless bodyguards
are also warriors.

225
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,750
You guys tell him your levels.

226
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,120
Intermediate senior warrior.

227
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,500
(Ah.)

228
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,750
(Intermediate senior warrior,
same as Uncle Wu.)

229
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,280
Intermediate senior warrior.

230
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,180
Intermediate senior warrior.

231
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,370
(Three intermediate senior warriors
as bodyguards.)

232
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,970
Advanced senior warrior.

233
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,400
(Almost as strong as Thunder Team.)

234
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:08,140
(It seems that the Wang family
in Jingdu is really powerful.)

235
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,880
(Because of Li Wei,)

236
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,760
(it's very likely that I'm on
the Paulinus' investigation list.)

237
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,370
(If the Wang family...)

238
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,810
So? Why don't you have a fight?

239
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:21,630
Huh?

240
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:25,130
Fight friendly.

241
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:28,080
(Three intermediate senior warriors
and one advanced senior warrior.)

242
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,300
(Without Spirit Energy,)

243
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,270
(I'm not sure I can win.)

244
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,740
(But if I use Spirit Energy,)

245
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,040
(I'll be a target
of Li Wei's parents in no time.)

246
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,860
(What to do?)

247
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,810
(No, I can't throw in the towel.)

248
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,020
Come on!

249
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,600
Brother Wang, you are here, too.

250
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,000
(Wang Xingping, one of the nine
core families of HR Alliance.)

251
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
(Young master of the Wang family
in Jingdu city.)

252
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,300
(He transferred from Jingdu
to Jiangnan University for Xu Xin.)

253
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,900
(Heng Xia, freshman of
Jiangnan University. A talented warrior)

254
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,900
(sent to the basic training camp
by Extreme Martial Club. Handsome.)

255
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,900

background, father is a God of War.)
