(Based on the novel "Swallowed Star".)

25
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,860
(Previously on Swallowed Star)
(You've passed B-level test.)

26
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,060
(Congratulations, Luo Feng)

27
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,680
(19 years old, primary senior warrior.)

28
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,920
(He's on the list of suspects
who killed Wei.)

29
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,380
(Jiangnan Pavilion is over there.)

30
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,840
(Shi Jiang, Zhao Ruo. Your junior
is here.)

31
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,200
(Higher points
mean rarer cultivation resources.)

32
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,040
(If you find that he might be
a Spirit Master.)

33
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,880
(William, I need you to do something.)

34
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,120
(Special training begins.)

35
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,600
=Episode 24=

36
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,900
(Strength 28000)

37
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,120
(Thanks to the resources here,)

38
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,330
(I've mastered the power generating
method of Nine Thundering Sabre.)

39
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,690
(Now my fist power is 2.8 times
stronger.)

40
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,240
(The power of my legs and feet,
along with my running speed)

41
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,120
(have been greatly improved.)

42
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,710
The training has been completed.

43
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,520
You're working too hard.

44
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,420
What time is it, senior?

45
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,040
It's almost eight o'clock.

46
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,520
Tonight, all the seniors from Hanxia
will come and welcome you.

47
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,530
(Invitation)

48
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,820
Don't be late!

49
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,720
I won't.

50
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,240
Cheers!

51
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,810
Finally.

52
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,960
You are the protagonist.
Of course, everyone comes to you.

53
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,840
And Senior Chu Qiang paid for all this.

54
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,140
You should drink to him later.

55
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,390
Senior Chu Qiang?

56
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:58,630
(No.2 Chu Qiang 540601)

57
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,130
He's second on the list.

58
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,350
There he is.

59
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,990
The world's major organizations
are all trying to woo him.

60
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,760
But a year ago,

61
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,400
Senior Chu Qiang has joined the
Hanxia Military.

62
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,950
After that, he is even busier,

63
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,670
but he keeps training
until late at night almost every day.

64
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:21,560
Wait for me. Let's make a toast to
Senior Chu Qiang together.

65
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,010
Hello.

66
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,840
We are partying downstairs,
but we got too much cake.

67
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,440
Would you like to try it?

68
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,050
Thank you.

69
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,880
What's up?

70
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,440
I'm William Addison from Europa.

71
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,440
I've been in training camp for a year.

72
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,000
Your name is Luo Feng, right?

73
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,660
Yeah.

74
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,350
I've always been curious
about Hanxia's martial arts.

75
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,130
I heard they recruited you only.

76
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,920
There must be something unique
about your skills.

77
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,550
Would you like to compete with me?

78
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,380
Compete?

79
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,000
The competition among students is

80
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,620
carried out in the challenge room of
Ninth Tower.

81
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,320
There's usually a stake.

82
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,560
But let's just learn from each other
with no stake.

83
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,140
William, Luo Feng is new here.

84
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,900
So you want to fight him and earn money?

85
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,140
Bet with me if you dare.

86
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,200
We're just learning from each other.

87
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,200
There's no stake.

88
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,680
William, we all know that
you're looking for new people to fight.

89
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,760
A student told me just now,

90
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,890
that he went to the challenge room
with you

91
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,140
and lost a billion.

92
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,980
Now you're looking for new people
to fight with no stake.

93
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,390
What do you want?

94
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm keen on studying martial arts
all over the world.

95
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm familiar with the senior students'
moves.

96
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,840
I just want to learn some new moves
from new students.

97
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,780
It's not about money.
So there's no stake.

98
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,970
Excuses.

99
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,700
It's a pity that the new students
from Hanxia recently

100
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,510
are not good.

101
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,830
My friend said that

102
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:10,760
Hanxia's martial arts are in name only,
but I don't believe it.

103
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:17,980
Because I believe Luo Feng's strength
will not disappoint me, right?

104
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,560
(There must be some purpose behind
his obvious provocative approach.)

105
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,390
(But he's so aggressive.)

106
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,490
(I have to save Hanxia's honor.)

107
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,990
If you want to fight, let's do it.

108
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,050
But it's no fun without a stake.

109
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,050
A little bit more, five billion.

110
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,670
How can you bet with him?
What's in your mind!

111
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,200
All right, I'll bet you.

112
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,590
OK.

113
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,200
I'll apply to use the challenge room
when I get back.

114
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,200
See you later.

115
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,960
Luo Feng.

116
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,760
Senior Chu Qiang.

117
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,770
So there's no need to introduce myself.

118
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,930
Senior, Luo Feng is new here.

119
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,850
And he's gambling 5 billion
with a senior.

120
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,230
Help me persuade him.

121
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,500
I'm sorry, sis.

122
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,120
He didn't get overwhelmed by a senior.

123
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,370
There are not many new students
with such courage and insight.

124
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,370
But talking is not enough.

125
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,260
You have to practice hard.

126
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,730
When you're done,

127
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,550
if you want to join our military,

128
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,760
just come to me!

129
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,700
Thank you, senior.

130
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,760
=Swallowed Star=

131
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:10,510
I'm pissed.
Even Senior Chu Qiang is helping you!

132
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,670
All right, all right.

133
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,820
Don't be angry, senior.

134
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,360
Those who can enter the
Elite Training Camp

135
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,520
are all geniuses.

136
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,000
No matter how talented you are,

137
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,650
you have to
suffer losses when fighting the seniors.

138
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,650
(Combat power level setting)
I've checked.

139
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,780
I think combat power is the indicator
that best reflects

140
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,010
(Medium: potential. Good: qualified.)
the strength of students.

141
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:34,730
(Excellent 8-16: excellent students.)

142
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,930
(Battle scene)
My combat power is 4.48, which is good.

143
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,120
And those students
who have been training for a year

144
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,740
(Gymnasium)
are at the medium level, like William.

145
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,900
So I dare to agree.

146
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,900
I won't spare you if you lose.

147
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,830
It's done.

148
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,370
It's tomorrow morning.

149
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,430
You're still worried, Yao.

150
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,600
We need to know every detail of
this fight.

151
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,490
I'm going to watch it myself.

152
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,960
Well, who do you think will win today?

153
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,390
I think Luo Feng will.

154
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,600
I think William.

155
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,760
Luo Feng. Remember this.

156
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,900
There is no shortcut to
becoming stronger.

157
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,800
Just accept your weakness and
do your best.

158
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,250
Don't worry about winning or losing.

159
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,930
(Ninth Tower)

160
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,260
(Waiting to connect)

161
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,000
(Connected)

162
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,010
(Battle scene)
Please select the battle scene.

163
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,120
You choose.

164
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,560
(Gymnasium)

165
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:22,800
Luo Feng, you could have chosen a scene
that was good for you.

166
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,760
But you chose a gymnasium with
no obstacles in it.

167
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,760
You are too confident

168
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,660
or you have other skills?

169
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,120
(The battle begins.)

170
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,390
Come on!

171
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,810
Fly-cutter.

172
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,810
It's a common weapon for Spirit Masters.

173
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,910
William's starting to take the lead.

174
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,630
So mean!

175
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,010
This is called maximizing the
utilization of equipment.

176
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,800
His nose is slightly open and
his breath comes in short pants.

177
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,210
He's taking it.

178
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,890
Provocative approach is not enough.
He should have a backup plan.

179
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,960
Anger will make him aggressive and
move more,

180
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,120
