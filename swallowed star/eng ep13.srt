00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,330
Mr. Lu Gang's funeral

35
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,450
(Obituary: Loss of God of War.)
will be held at the Heroes Hall

36
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,550
(Obituary: Loss of God of War.)
at 10:00 a.m. this morning.

37
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,100
It's 9:45 in the morning.

38
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,360
Warriors and dignitaries have begun
to pay their respects.

39
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,600
(Obituary: Loss of God of War.)

40
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,230
National TV is here.

41
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,900
God of War's funeral is broadcast live
across the country.

42
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,250
We don't have many Gods of War
in our country.

43
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,000
Every God of War will be mourned
by the whole nation.

44
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,160
(Mr. Lu Gang)

45
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,200
(died for the country and mankind.)

46
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,100
Xin.

47
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,700
Yes. Grandpa.

48
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,000
(Xu Xin's grandfather?)

49
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,450
(He must be the master of the Xu Clan.)

50
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,560
(He's also here.)

51
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,250
Gang.

52
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,900
Guo Hai,
I didn't expect to see you here.

53
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,760
I thought you were in the wilderness.

54
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,700
Mr. Lu Gang's Funeral is a big deal.

55
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,100
I have to come even if
I was on a mission.

56
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,830
Mr. Lu Gang guided me back then.

57
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,200
I can't believe
a strong man like him would...

58
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,600
It was the rat surge.
He was strong but...

59
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:23,860
The kid was in county 0201 at that time,

60
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,700
but he managed to escape!

61
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,660
Kid?

62
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,900
There, Luo Feng.

63
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,560
He's still got a thing for Xin.

64
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,000
Last time, I warned him

65
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,800
to stay away from my sister.
Looks like he hasn't given up yet.

66
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,330
He's just a soldier.

67
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,660
Far worse than you.

68
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,590
You're 21 years old, and you're
an intermediate senior warrior.

69
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,630
Soldier?

70
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:46,900
That's delayed information.

71
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,000
I know Luo Feng.

72
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,730
He's killed over 10,000 monsters
in two months.

73
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:56,100
Almost all were advanced beast soldiers,
hence the name "Psycho".

74
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,400
He's probably as strong
as a primary senior warrior.

75
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,400
Primary senior warrior? He's only 18.

76
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,230
Captain,
the Fire Hammer Team is also here.

77
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,060
Let's take this opportunity
to get rid of them.

78
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,860
Captain, you're saying...

79
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,150
This time,
we'll be working with the Thunder Team.

80
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,360
We can play some tricks

81
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,310
and pit them against
the Fire Hammer Team.

82
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,060
The Thunder Team is strong,

83
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,630
they can easily kill
the whole Fire Hammer Team.

84
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,260
That's a good plan.

85
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,330
They should be here by now.

86
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,000
We'll go in now, Young Master.

87
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,230
You guys go ahead.
I'll go to the hotel to get some rest.

88
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,530
Foreigners?

89
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,100
It's the Paulinus Clan.

90
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,230
Paulinus Clan,
one of the nine clans of HR Alliance?

91
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,900
The white man's name is Charon,
the old man's surname is Liu.

92
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,600
(What a sharp look!)

93
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,460
It seems the old man
has rich combat experience.

94
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,000
They're all advanced senior warriors,
especially the old Liu.

95
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,530
He's almost a God of War.

96
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,960
God of War!

97
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,800
They're bodyguards of the Paulinus Clan.

98
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,960
Two advanced senior warriors are here.

99
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,400
It means they're
on an important mission.

100
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,200
Uh? Huya Squad.

101
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,700
They are the Fire Hammer Team?

102
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,800
Yes, Mr. Liu.

103
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,500
I don't care about
your personal grudges.

104
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,260
I want you to keep an eye out
for the mission in City 003.

105
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,330
I don't want to be held back.

106
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,940
We must protect the Young Master.

107
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,900
Yes, it's all set.

108
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,000
I can't believe
the warplane could land right here!

109
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,800
It’s the superior
of Extreme Martial Club.

110
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,730
Even the dignitaries come to greet him.

111
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,700
(It's him.)

112
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,100
You know Senator Zhu Xi?

113
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,560
I met him once in test of warrior-to-be.
Who is he?

114
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,400
Senator Zhu Xi, one of
Extreme Martial Club's core powers.

115
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,500
His power is second to
the funder of the club,

116
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,530
the most powerful man in the world,
Hong.

117
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,200
He's also one of the 5 major inspectors
of the club.

118
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,900
Rumor has it that
he's outgunned God of War.

119
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,230
Outgunned God of War?

120
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,860
(We didn't find his body,
maybe he is...)

121
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,030
He was buying time for reinforcements.

122
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,060
He was strong enough
to escape unscathed.

123
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,900
Mr. Lu Gang was so good,

124
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,960
but he sacrificed in the rat surge...

125
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,330
The war between the warriors
and the beasts will continue.

126
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,430
We need to be more vigilant
about the internal strife.

127
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,630
You mean Huya Squad.

128
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,860
They seem to have made contact
with the Paulinus Clan.

129
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:19,200
It's a powerful family
with many Gods of War.

130
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,760
Huya Squad could only

131
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,200
do some legwork for the Paulinus Clan.

132
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,800
How could Gods of War
possibly help them?

133
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,060
Captain,
if the Paulinus has nothing but wealth,

134
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,150
they wouldn't have attracted
so many Gods of War, they...

135
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,160
No, for such a big clan,

136
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,800
it isn't hard to raise Gods of War.

137
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,240
Just like the three children
of Mr. Lu Gang's,

138
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,130
two of them are senior warriors.

139
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,000
The gene can be inherited.

140
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,330
-Inherited?
-The cell in the warrior's body

141
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,860
absorbs genetic energy

142
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:54,350
which perfects the genes, and it
can be passed on to future generations.

143
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,700
Let's say the most powerful man, Hong.
The second best, Thunder.

144
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,500
And Senator Zhu Xi we met today.

145
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,000
Their children
are usually Gods of War.

146
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,230
So a big clan like the Paulinus,

147
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,800
can always strengthen
the bloodline.

148
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,450
It's an advantage
we ordinary warriors don't have.

149
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:15,530
If the strong gene is passed on,
then in the future...

150
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:18,700
Maybe we'd defeat the monsters for good.

151
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,250
But it's a very long way to go.

152
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,200
What we can do now
is to defeat as many monsters as we can.

153
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,800
I have a bold idea.

154
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,400
Mr. Lu Gang had been guarding City 003.

155
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,730
And now that he's gone,
there will be many more monsters there.

156
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:39,800
The nation has called in
a team of senior warriors.

157
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,130
Why don't we go to City 003, too?

158
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,730
City 003.

159
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,360
It's one of the most dangerous areas
in Eurasia,

160
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,000
with Asia's most prolific buildings.

161
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,500
There are large numbers
of beast generals there.

162
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,500
Some are even stronger than that.

163
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,860
And it's near the ocean.

164
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,530
Many ocean beasts emerge in rivers.

165
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,930
They are far worse than land beasts.

166
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:06,730
Have you forgotten?

167
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,030
Why did we take the genetic agentia?

168
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,260
Not to be somebody

169
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,900
or to show off,

170
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,900
but to kill more monsters

171
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,100
and take back what is rightfully ours.

172
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,560
Right. We can't let Mr. Lu Gang
die for nothing.

173
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,330
Captain and Luo Feng are right.
We can't back down!

174
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,800
We're going to City 003!

175
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,960
=Swallowed Star=

176
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,230
There are a lot of troops
and high-ranking warriors.

177
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,800
It is very close to City 003.

178
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,700
To deal with any sudden attack,

179
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,760
the military configuration is way better
than that of other military commands.

180
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,130
There are a lot of
flying beasts in City 003.

181
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,400
So this military district
has to take on more air defense.

182
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,060
There are ocean beasts in rivers too.

183
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,400
This city's got ocean beasts,
land beasts

184
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,200
and flying beasts, all of them!

185
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,060
The Fire Hammer Team came!
They're seeking their death.

186
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:01,800
Don't worry.
Mr. Liu can defeat them easily.

187
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:03,730
But

188
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,360
the 2 martial clubs and 5 great powers
forbid warriors from killing each other.

189
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:09,800
We...

190
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,030
Don't worry.

191
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:15,200
Mr. Liu can kill them
without everyone knowing.

192
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,000
Even if the two martial clubs
and the five great powers find it out,

193
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:24,100
the Paulinus could deal with it easily
as they are so powerful.

194
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,730
The captain's right. This time,

195
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,930
I'll kill Luo Feng myself!

196
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,580
(The UN has declared
a state of emergency.)

197
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:45,300
That's City 003,
it used to be the economic center,

198
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,160
Shanghai.

199
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,360
Now there are good
and evil people mixed up.

200
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:54,930
There are many beast generals
and Gods of War there.

201
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,000
There are many powerhouses
from home and abroad.

202
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,700
It's also a place
where Mr. Lu Gang fought.

203
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:07,060
We can't just go into the city,
let's go slowly from the suburbs.

204
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,300
Hurry. Spread out!

205
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,830
It's an armored car
before the Great Nirvana.

206
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,430
Black Crowned Golden Eagle.

207
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,460
Prepare for the battle.

208
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,260
A Black Crowned Golden Eagle,
primary beast officer.

209
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,700
Two black snakes,
advanced beast soldiers.

210
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,760
Over 30 Lion Mastiffs.

211
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,500
So many monsters in half an hour.

212
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,000
It has never happened before.

213
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:49,530
That's the City 003.
Cunning beasts are everywhere.

214
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,930
You'll barely have time to take a break.

215
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,230
Captain, we got a big one.

216
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,300
Two-headed black snake,
and it's about to have a horn.

217
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,460
At least an advanced beast officer.

218
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,700
-Foreigners.
-They don't seem to be a match.

219
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,300
Right.

220
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,030
Though they are foreigners,
we are all warriors protecting mankind.

221
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,900
We can't just sit and watch them die.

222
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,560
Good, join hands.

223
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:07,630
OK.

224
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,860
(It's after me.)

225
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,060
Hit its vital part!

226
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:07,900
(So hard).

227
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:11,960
(Nine Thundering Sabre.)

228
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,860
(Second stage, hidden power!)

229
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,330
Good.

230
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,500
Gao Feng.

231
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,730
That's good.

232
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,160
-It's them.
-Advanced senior warriors, this is bad.

233
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,880
It's Thunder Team's prey.

234
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,760
(Thunder Team?)

235
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,200
You'll have to spit it out
even if you have it.

236
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:24,330
This one's mine.

237
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,400
(Two-headed black snake,
advanced beast officer)

238
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,500
(One of the best of the snake beasts.
Mutant ones are close to beast general.)

239
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
(The poison teeth are deadly.
Whoever gets bitten will be dead.)

240
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,160
(Indian Team. Senior warriors.
A team of Indian senior warriors.)

241
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,160
(It's led by a bald man
who's good at using long sticks.)

242
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,160
(It's strong. Two team members
are good at shield knives.)

(Please release the Indian team.)

275
00:20:48,933 --> 00:20:51,067
(Who are you to make demands?)

276
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:56,800
(Two advanced senior warriors,
if they attack,)

277
00:20:57,367 --> 00:20:59,000
(we may not even have a chance
to react.)

278
00:20:59,233 --> 00:21:01,100
(Instead of waiting and defending,)

279
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,467
(we'd better...)

280
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:12,833
(Call me when your team finds out
where Fire Hammer Team is.)
