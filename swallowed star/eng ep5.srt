(Based on the novel "Swallowed Star".)

25
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,000
(Previously on Swallowed Star)
(Luo Feng has been put in the detention.)

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,900
(I want your men to
mess with him there.)

27
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,030
(He is a warrior-to-be,)

28
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,150
(and already in detention for fighting.)

29
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,550
(If he causes trouble in there,)

30
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,410
(he will be disqualified.)

31
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,600
(I'll transfer you
to the Yi'an detention house first.)

32
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,700
(Get rid of someone for me.)

33
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,120
(Well,
is this the energy from the universe?)

34
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,480
=Episode 5=

35
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,640
(The scent of shadow last night
was strange.)

36
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,890
(I feel like there is
the malice approaching.)

37
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,120
Bah, these dishes are unsavory!

38
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,340
(Is it an illusion?)

39
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,200
Go, go.

40
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,360
I thought it was someone tough.

41
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,560
Just this brat?

42
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,520
Be good, we will only break
one arm and leg of you.

43
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,300
You won't suffer much.

44
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,800
Come on, all of you. And you.

45
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:57,500
I have to make sure
you're qualified enough. Go!

46
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:26,580
(Keep quiet)

47
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,710
(For new life)

48
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,920
Good, that makes you a perfect prey.

49
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,160
Come on now.

50
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,010
Well, disappointing!

51
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:58,170
I wanted to take it slowly
and have fun,

52
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,030
but now, I have to make it quick.

53
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,850
Good. You're getting me
more and more excited.

54
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,180
(Turn over a new leaf)

55
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,720
Five Acupoints Skywards
is not a big deal to him.

56
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,900
(His spirituality surprised me.)

57
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,450
(How is it possible?)

58
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,400
(How could my fly-cutter miss him?)

59
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,500
Get down, all of you!

60
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,590
Stay down. Don't move!

61
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,470
Get him to the infirmary now.

62
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,990
(In addiction to Zhang Haobai,)

63
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,310
(I also saw Luo Feng's family members
were injured.)

64
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,480
I thought there was something fishy.

65
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,110
So I checked the monitor.

66
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:54,990
Oh.

67
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:58,880
I heard that the security guard was
about to delete the surveillance video.

68
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,320
Thank you for bringing it here.

69
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,230
Director, we got something from Cobra.

70
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,770
He said he was ordered by Zhou Huayang.

71
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,200
I see. Make the arrangement.

72
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,860
Yes.

73
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,570
(Oh,
thank you for providing the evidence.)

74
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:17,020
(We will deal with the case
according to law.)

75
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,820
(Where is this place?)

76
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,400
(Looks like a military sanitarium.)

77
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,240
(I think my eyes and ears
are sharper now.)

78
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,450
(I can control objects
without touching?)

79
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:19,850
(Go!)

80
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:30,160
(Is this the rare Spirit Energy
the instructor mentioned?)

81
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,240
(Whether it's Spirit Energy or not,
I'll check it out later.)

82
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,820
(I should practice
Genetic Energy Practices now.)

83
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,630
=Swallowed Star=

84
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,300
(My head!)

85
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,290
(Where is this now?)

86
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:33,180
(Did I get into my subconsciousness?)

87
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,470
(The fog)

88
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,110
(is Spirit Energy.)

89
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,760
(This dark golden ball)

90
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,120
(is probably
the source of Spirit Energy.)

91
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,590
(Does it have something to do
with my headaches?)

92
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,260
(Maybe my current condition)

93
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,420
(does not allow me
to stand that much of energy.)

94
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,760
(I need to try harder
to make good use of this energy.)

95
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,710
Ah, Mr. Luo Feng. Feeling better?

96
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,040
Yes, much better.

97
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:30,730
Sit, please.

98
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,160
I'm Dong An from Yi'an detention house.

99
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,820
This is the
military sanitarium in the district.

100
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,340
Mr. Luo Feng, you can go home today.

101
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,150
I can go home?

102
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,600
What about my qualification
as a warrior-to-be?

103
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,830
Don't worry about it.

104
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,830
We got witness's testimony

105
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:55,180
and checked the surveillance.
We've also ascertained what happened.

106
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,730
(Who is the witness?)

107
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,120
(I should say thank you in person.)

108
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,000
As for prisoners
who tried to attack you,

109
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,510
according to our investigation,

110
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:08,700
they were ordered to
break one arm and leg of you.

111
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,840
Who ordered them?

112
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,640
A local villain named Zhou Huayang.

113
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,390
I don't know him.

114
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:20,970
(We've already interrogated him.
Maybe there is someone behind him,)

115
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,580
(but I'm not sure.)

116
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,740
(Maybe the guy
has powerful connections.)

117
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,800
You can ask Jiangnan Security Bureau
to investigate it.

118
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,750
As an organ in charge of
military affairs, they can help you.

119
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,440
OK, thank you.

120
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,540
(Powerful connections?)

121
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,060
(I haven't offended anyone
except Zhang Haobai.)

122
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,920
Oh, and one more thing,
someone asked me to give you this.

123
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,230
(Application
of College Entrance Examination)

124
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,010
He failed? How come?

125
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,230
Alas,
I didn't expect Cobra was so unreliable.

126
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,770
It seems that we have to find
a real warrior next time.

127
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,230
Next time?

128
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,010
What?

129
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,150
Cobra sold me out.

130
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:11,740
I pulled a lot of strings, but couldn't
delete the surveillance video.

131
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,450
If Luo Feng submits a request to
Security Bureau for investigation,

132
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,410
this video will be a valid clue.

133
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,490
How can this happen? How come?

134
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,610
Zhou, did you sell me out?

135
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,300
Even if I zip my lips, if Luo Feng
turns to the Security Bureau,

136
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,480
they will find you sooner or later.

137
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,640
Even your uncle could not
cover you on this.

138
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:40,510
We have been friends for years.
That's why I'm telling you this.

139
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,390
Otherwise,
you won't even know what's going on.

140
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,160
Go to your uncle and discuss it.

141
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,880
He's much better than you.

142
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,460
No, no, I don't want to
be caught by the Security Bureau!

143
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,240
Uncle, I'm going to find my uncle!

144
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,660
OK, here you are.

145
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,040
Director Dong, could you tell me

146
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,800
who was the witness
that testified for me?

147
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,450
Does this application form
remind you of someone?

148
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,620
Enough?

149
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,200
Hu.

150
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,070
This is a big deal.
Do you have any idea?

151
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,560
Don't worry, brother.

152
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,580
Haobai, you are grounded from now on.

153
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,400
Don't go out and make troubles.

154
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,680
Yes, uncle.

155
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,770
Alas.

156
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,750
We could have had
a winner last time! Damn it!

157
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,520
And you.
You're lucky you can get out of there.

158
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,380
Don't make any trouble again!

159
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,340
Don't do anything else.

160
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:04,560
Even if the Security Bureau comes,
don't act rashly. I'll deal with it.

161
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,190
Only the powerful ones
get a say in this world.

162
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:12,030
Luo Feng is just a warrior-to-be.

163
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,520
A brat who hasn't fought a real monster.

164
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,280
If he dares to mess with me,

165
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,800
I'll make sure he suffers.

166
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,760
(She went through all the troubles
to send me this form,)

167
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,240
(I'll take good care of it.)

168
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,330
Luo Feng.

169
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,600
I'm here to get some fresh air.
You like the scenery here, too?

170
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,890
Yes.

171
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,700
Xu Xin, thank you for testifying for me.

172
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,200
You're welcome.
I've always believed you.

173
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,670
By the way, congratulations on passing
the test of warrior-to-be.

174
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:25,900
Thank you,
but I haven't passed the field test yet.

175
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,270
Compared with the predecessors
who have fought with

176
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,270
real monsters, I have a long way to go.

177
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,600
I remember the way you looked at
the warrior when

178
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,600
the Black Crowned Golden Eagle attacked.

179
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,220
It was so dangerous,

180
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,080
there was no fear in your eyes,
but yearning.

181
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:58,080
I've learned one thing since then.

182
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,890
Your goal is not within the fence.

183
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,210
Not within the fence?

184
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:14,520
You want to protect the world.
I'll help you with it.
