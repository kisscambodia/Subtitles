(Previously on Swallowed Star)
I won't make the same mistake this time.

26
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,020
Congratulations! You are warriors now.

27
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,367
Yeah, we passed!

28
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,680
Dear new warrior, Luo Feng,

29
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,120
welcome to the House of the Extreme.

30
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,900
Purchase the first three stages
of the Nine thundering sabre.

31
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,180
He must be brought to justice!

32
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm the lieutenant of the team.

33
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,380
I'll take care of you.

34
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,020
I will get rid of him

35
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,180
sooner or later.

36
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,310

37
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,280

(Fire Hammer Team Battle Suit)

39
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,800
(Luo Feng.
It's your first day in our team.)

40
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,790
(You're lucky.
There's a pop-up mission.)

41
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:08,880
Captain, I'd like you to meet our
new recruit, Luo Feng.

42
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,110
This is our captain, Gao Feng.

43
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,710
Captain.

44
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,800
Go get it. I'm sure you'll fit in soon.

45
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,520
(Strong strength, but he seems to
be carefully controlling it.)

46
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,900
Yes. Captain!

47
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,060
These three are all members
of the Fire Hammer Team.

48
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,650
(Wei Tie, Zhang Ke, Chen Gu, Wei Qing)
Wei Tie, Zhang Ke, Wei Qing.

00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,650
(Wei Tie, Zhang Ke, Chen Gu, Wei Qing)

50
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,080
This is the manager of HR Alliance.
Please brief them.

51
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,420
Here's the thing.

52
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,410
We established a volunteer team within
our Biology Institute

53
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,300
and sent them to collect DNA samples
of monsters in county 0201 lately.

54
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,050
But we were informed that the team
was under attack.

55
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,380
Please bring them back safe and sound.

56
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,210
Doesn't the HR Alliance claim to
control half of the world's economy?

57
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,180
Why don't you send
a team of warriors to do it?

58
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,030
Alas.

59
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,990
Only one of their communication watches
is still working,

60
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,400
and the battery will be dead
in less than an hour.

61
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,020
Once the signal is gone,
we might not be able to rescue them.

62
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,140
We won't make it in an hour.

63
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,740
You're the only hope now.

64
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,810
Well, if that's the case...

65
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,960
Please find those volunteers.

66
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,720
They're very important
to the HR Alliance.

67
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,460
Since it's an emergency, let's go now.

68
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,460
If you have any questions,
let's talk on the way.

69
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,430
Everybody, run!

70
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,330
Don't mind me.

71
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,560
Wei Qing, Wei Tie.
Luo Feng is also a sabre user.

72
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,240
Teach him a little bit more.

73
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,890
Well, got it. Don't hold us back.

74
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,080
I think something's
around here.

75
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,660
What is it?

76
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,590
Well.

77
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,870
Shh, I heard it, too.
Get ready to fight.

78
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,700
Some big monsters are coming!

79
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,910
It's one-horned boar!

80
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,260
Luo Feng's in danger, go help him!

81
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:30,760
This is... Nine Thundering Sabre?

82
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,260
He's not skillful enough. Let's go.

83
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,960
Looks like Luo Feng can handle it.
Wait a minute.

84
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,090
Ha ha! Impressive. It's your first fight

85
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:09,160
and you killed a senior beast soldier.

86
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,360
Senior beast soldier?

87
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,980
Yes, the so-called level-F.

88
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,440
We warriors put the monsters
into different ranks.

89
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,960
There are beast soldiers,
officers and generals.

90
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,700
Each is subdivided into primary,
intermediate and advanced level,like us.

91
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,090
Bro Qing.

92
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,540
The unicorn is yours as you killed it.

93
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,720
Manager Wang, about the list of
the volunteers, how's it going?

94
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,400
(It's in your communication watches.)

95
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,070
OK.

96
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,230
(Xu Xin, female, Jiangnan University)
(Xu Xin, why is she...)

97
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,800
(She's also on the list.)

98
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,100
Luo Feng, you know someone on the list?

99
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,500
Yes.

100
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,500
We'll do the search and rescue together.

101
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,690
There will be
the best possible team plan.

102
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,380
Remember. Care for nothing.
Don't act recklessly.

103
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,470
Look what I found.

104
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,070
What's this, Zhang?

105
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,330
Ultrasonic device.

106
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:07,520
It's been transmitting at frequencies
that humans can't hear.

107
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,690
That's why there are
so many monsters here.

108
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,010
Someone's using it
to attract them to come.

109
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:16,260
Well,
this is the only way to county 0201.

110
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,930
They're using the warriors passing by
as bait to attract the monsters

111
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,210
and then kill them in one shot.

112
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,960
So the bastards are lurking nearby.

113
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,530
I didn't see anyone.

114
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,830
It's probably one of their traps.

115
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,270
Maybe they are lurking
somewhere else as we speak.

116
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,460
Let's speed up and get there
as soon as possible.

117
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,810
Boss, did you just hear anything?

118
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,820
What's up?

119
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:49,650
It'd be bad if any one of them
is still alive.

120
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:53,360
Let's go.
There are a lot of monsters here.

121
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,630
=Swallowed Star=

122
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,230

123
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,390
No contact yet?

124
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,340
No.

125
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,980
That's weird. It hasn't been long.

126
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,520
Could be another incident.

127
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,330
We need to hurry.

128
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:52,020
(Huya Squad, Zhang Zehu)
(This kid's with the Fire Hammer Team?)

129
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,760
Hey, you look awful.
How's your nephew doing?

130
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,400
Chen, you're taking a rookie with you.

131
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,010
He might hold you up

132
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,300
and get you all killed.

133
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,220
We're in a hurry to save lives,

134
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,120
or else,
I have to teach you guys a lesson!

135
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:17,050
(Huya Squad, One-eye)
You don't like them, why not kill them?

136
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,450
It can wait.

137
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:23,980
Did you hear he mentioned saving lives?
Looks like they're going to 0201.

138
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,680
0201. Is that today's...

139
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,000
Let's inform the captain
that we've got another visitor.

140
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,410
(Huya Squad Li Xiao)
Boss. Here comes the Fire Hammer Team.

141
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,740
Alright.

142
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:58,990
(Huya Squad, Pan Ya)
(Geezer, we got the perfect bait for you.)

143
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,210
(Look like no one's been here.
Next house.)

144
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,580
Did you reach them?

145
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,820
No.

146
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,700
That's impossible.

147
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,970
Ultrasound devices are placed here too.
We need to be very careful.

148
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,490
Judging from the watch
and the ultrasonic device,

149
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,880
they must have been attacked
by monsters.

150
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,040
There must be casualties.

151
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,980
There are many monsters in the county.

152
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:35,550
It'd be hard for them to

153
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,400
survive the siege.

154
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,080
It's time to hunt.

155
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,000
What's up?

156
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,610
Maybe we missed some of their devices.

157
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,850
If that comes from the devices,
then the monsters...

158
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,720
So many monsters here!

159
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,910
Run! We can't be held up.

160
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,800
(Huya Squad Dong. Huya Squad Tietou)
Tietou, you stay and coordinate with Zhang Zehu.

161
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,380
OK.

162
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,440
Dong. Follow the Fire Hammer Team.

163
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,100
Don't move.
Let me make it harder for you.

164
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,500
Bastards, how dare they
act like this on our old turf?

165
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,750
There are too many monsters,
we can't search for the survivors.

166
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:36,280
They run so fast.

167
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,840
Looks like I missed someone last time.

168
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,850
It doesn't matter.
I'm killing you right away.

169
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,760
Gunshot?

170
00:14:59,020 --> 00:14:59,680
Over there!

171
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,980
Maybe the survivors are in danger?
Let's get over there.

Matched.
She's the rescue target, Xu Xin.

173
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,240
There are more monsters!
Take the survivor and run!
