00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,560

00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,460
=Episode 12=

36
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,600
(Mom and dad start to enjoy life
after working hard for most of their lives.)

37
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,900
(Hua's enjoying
his relationship.)

(Nan)

39
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,700
(Thanks to this city,
the last stronghold of human.)

40
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,000
(Warriors should fight for it.)

41
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,730
(In the second stage of
Nine Thundering Sabre,)

42
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,330
(I need to strike twice when hitting.
It's too hard.)

43
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,600
(We can't let monsters
ruin the city.)

44
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,130
(I have to master the second stage
while in the wilderness this time.)

45
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,630
Captain, send me to county 0201.

46
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,360
Alone?

47
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes.

48
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,000
The monster is a threat to our city,
I'd like to help.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,160
But there's a lot of monsters out there,
once they besiege you...

50
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,900
Spirit Master's not
afraid of a siege, though.

51
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,800
But are you sure?

52
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,700
Only you?
It's dangerous to go to the wilderness alone.

53
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,400
I know.

54
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,200
Where are you heading?

55
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,400
County 0201.

56
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,460
If you can kill monsters
and collect trophies

57
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,850
like ears,

58
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,400
you'll get reward from the army.

59
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,200
Try to get back before dark.

60
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,850
Here we go.

61
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,700
How many monsters
did you kill?

62
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,100
198.

63
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,300
Luo. Word is out in the base
that you killed many monsters.

64
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,380
They call you "Psycho."

65
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:44,800
Ah?

66
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,500
So handsome!

67
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,790
(Luo Feng No. 1)
He is Luo Feng.

68
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,130
-No offense. We admire you!
-Hey, Luo Feng!

69
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,700
(Many monsters in the wilderness
were heading to)

70
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,530
(0201 yesterday evening.)

71
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,900
(The military has raise)

72
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,100
(response level for the threats,)

73
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,800
(sending warriors to supply base.)

74
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,000
(Many monsters were killed
in the last 50 days.)

75
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,900
(My body power
has also improved.)

76
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,700
(But my sabre skill hasn't.)

77
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,800
(Something's wrong.
It's Wan Dong. After him...)

78
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,500
(Rat surge!)

79
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,700
Chen, bad things happened
to 0201. Come to Club.

80
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,920
Ah, Luo Feng went there!

81
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,040
I heard Lu Gang is also there.

82
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,500
I hope they're all right.

83
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,770
(Emergency! The military claims)

84
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:51,500
(rat monsters coming to 0201,)

85
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,850
(forming level 3 rat surge.)

86
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,640
(They can ruin a military base in minutes.)

87
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,410
(The military has deployed several planes
and rescue vehicles.)

88
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:03,360
(So far, no exact figures
on casualties.)

89
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,160
(Luo Feng.)

90
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,560
(Breaking News)

91
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,150
Are you OK?

92
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,750
(Damn, it's a dead end.)

93
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,400
(It's too late.)

94
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,800
You're Lu Gang,
God of War!

95
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,200
(It's true power of
Nine Thundering Sabre.)

96
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,300
Come on.

97
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,000
=Swallowed Star=

98
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,700
How's it going?

99
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,800
We're doing everything
we can to evacuate

100
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,860
and concentrate troops.

101
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,750
But according to their current speed,

102
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,800
the supply base in the Northern District
will be destroyed before the military arrives.

103
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,700
There are still
20,000 people there.

104
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,600
We're expecting heavy casualties.

105
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,380
When will the rat surge reach the base?

106
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,190
-Less than five minutes.
-What about the military?

107
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:27,200
The conveyor has arrived over the base.
But the warplanes ran into an accident.

108
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,500
It'll take at least ten minutes.

109
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,700
That means if someone holds off
the rat surge for five minutes,

110
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,600
The base will be safe, right?

111
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:37,150
Yes, but Mr. Lu, your safety is
very vital, please...

112
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,000
Let's go another way.

113
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,800
Now, jump!

114
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,400
(It's amazing he slows them down
with fire and lightning.)

115
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,900
Here's how you use
Nine Thundering Sabre.

116
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,560
Go!

117
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,400
When will planes arrive?

118
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,700
In 5 minutes at least.

119
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,230
I'll find ways to stall them.

120
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,500
It's working!

121
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,650
The leader seems wise.

122
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:49,000
The plan is outflanking and
these are cover.

123
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,800
Planes can't stay close to the ground long.

124
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,460
You two, jump in.

125
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,100
What about you?

126
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,100
You are future of the city.

127
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,300
Go.

128
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,660
Mr. Lu Gang!

129
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,190
Too many rats.
He will be exhausted at this rate.

130
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,760
(Finally.)

131
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,500
I'll ask captain
if they're back.

132
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:35,100
(Through combined efforts,)

133
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,400
(Jiangnan city survived
from the rate surge safely.)

134
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,500
However, casualties are huge.

135
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,560
God of War sacrificed in this case.

136
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,000
The military disclosed Lu Gang
used himself as bait

137
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,460
to attract the rats.

138
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,560
(In the course of evolution,)

139
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,000
(human are facing constant
threats of destroy.)

140
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,800
(warriors are the only hope.)

141
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,200
(But I'm not strong enough.)

142
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:10,700
(I'm not strong enough.)

143
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,840
(I just can't make the second strike!)

144
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,860
(Mr. Lu Gang was gentle
when hitting.)

145
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,800
(That's what this is about.)

146
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,760
(I was trying too hard,
which is beyond my physical fitness.)

147
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,360
(So there isn't enough
explosive force.)

148
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,530
Out!

149
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,900
He mastered
Nine Thundering Sabre!

150
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,260
You can't beat him.

151
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,360
We should get rid of him sooner.

152
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:40,460
Don't worry, I'll find someone strong
enough to make them die miserably.
