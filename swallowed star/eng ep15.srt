at the hotel today.)

while they're scattered.)

I'll make you pay!)

(I can't go further, this kid's so strong!)

34
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:39,700
Xiao!

35
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,933
You are so good!

36
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:03,233
I can only beat you with some tricks.

37
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,630
His right lung was shot.
This kid's not gonna make it.

38
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,930
But don't you worry.
Your family will be with you soon.

39
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,130
This thing.

40
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,960
I'm sure you're familiar with it.
A small ultrasonic device.

41
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,260
It can attract monsters
by mimicking their sonic frequencies.

42
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,360
They must really like you.

43
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,530
You! You're pretending!

44
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,000
You missed.

45
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,930
You're... A Spirit Master!

46
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,700
Did you break Zhang Ke's right hand?

47
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,300
Kill me.

48
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,680
I'm not like you guys from Huya Squad

49
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,700
who hurt other warriors,
but the monsters will.

50
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,130
Young Master, that was a clean cut.
Quick and deadly. Cut the throat.

51
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:22,360
Yeah, that was a hunting wolf,
a beast officer.

52
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,660
Smell of blood.

53
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,800
Hu, Xiao, reply. What's going on?

54
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:36,930
Oh, no.

55
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,300
Hu! Xiao!

56
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,000
Captain.
There's a bullet hole in the wall.

57
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,100
Monsters attacked suddenly.
They were so careless!

58
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,700
They stayed at the hotel
and relaxed their vigilance.

59
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:35,400
But that's strange. Master Liu.
Hu and Xiao are alert.

60
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:39,200
If they couldn't make it,
they would tell us with their watches.

61
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,600
Maybe other warriors attacked them.

62
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,160
(Master Liu is very prudent.)

63
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,000
(I don't know if
I can hide it from them.)

64
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:59,000
Of course, there's another possibility.
A beast officer attacked them.

65
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,700
They are extremely intelligent.

66
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,400
Especially those
in the hell of city 003.

67
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,500
They've mastered a lot of
human assassination techniques.

68
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:14,400
If a beast officer found them
and attacked them suddenly...

69
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,230
Then they would not
have a chance to tell us.

70
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,730
(Salty)

71
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,700
Master Liu, what about...

72
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,260
The master's training is still on.
The mission continues.

73
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,200
But if it was a warrior...

74
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,300
Even if it was a warrior who attacked,

75
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,600
it was an elaborately planned assassination
of these two losers.

76
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,800
It means he's just average.
No need to worry.

77
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,800
But if he was after Young Master...

78
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,900
Young Master is noble,
no one dares to kill him.

79
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,400
You've got nothing to worry about.
We'll work together.

80
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,430
No one's gonna lay a hand
on Thunder Team.

81
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,000
Alright. We'll follow you.

82
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,000
What's up?

83
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:37,000
Ultrasonic device. No.
This device has never stopped!

84
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,430
Lion mastiff, 5 meters tall.
A beast general.

85
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,400
What's going on?

86
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,400
They could do nothing right.

87
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,700
Go upstairs, now!

88
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,000
=Swallowed Star=

89
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,200
(So strong. They are indeed
the advanced senior warriors.)

90
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:39,000
Captain! Captain! Ah!

91
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,400
(Lion mastiff, 5 meters tall
and over six meters long.)

92
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,500
(An advanced beast officer.)

93
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,760
(He's getting a horn.
Almost a beast general.)

94
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,000
Protect Young Master.

95
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,700
Look behind you.

96
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,560
There's another advanced beast officer!

97
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,500
(What's going on?)

98
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:54,700
Uncle Li.

99
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,100
Uncle Wang.

100
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,900
Look at you. You're all messed up.

101
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,130
Li Wei, your dad got your distress call,

102
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:25,100
and found there were only two
Gods of War near you.

103
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,000
He called us as soon as he could.

104
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,100
Luckily, we weren't too far away
and we came in time.

105
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,400
(God of War. Two!)

106
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,300
What on earth happened, Liu?

107
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:40,300
You shouldn't mess with the herd
with two advanced beast officers!

108
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,930
Here's the thing, Mr. Wang.

109
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,730
We went for field training with
Young Master this morning

110
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,000
and two teammates that stayed here
were attacked by monsters.

111
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,400
They were dead. When we got back,

112
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,400
the monsters were hiding in the shadows
around the compound

113
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,100
and attacked us.
We were caught unprepared.

114
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,000
Strange! Warriors usually

115
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:05,500
hide in covert places
where monsters can't find.

116
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,600
How did you find the stronghold?
And who stayed here?

117
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:13,200
His squad, Huya Squad,
was in charge of finding stronghold and guarding.

118
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,660
Master Wang, Master Li.
My name is Pan Ya.

119
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,000
Huya Squad.

120
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,360
It's a team of senior warriors
hired by our Thunder Team.

121
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,660
We protect Young Master together.

122
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,800
Someone plots against you.
It probably holds grudges against you.

123
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,300
You're saying someone
got back at Huya Squad.

124
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:36,200
Li Wei's father has some enemies,
but they are all Gods of War.

125
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,500
They won't plot against a child.

126
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:44,260
Now the dead were
members of Huya Squad.

127
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,700
So it can only be retaliation
against your squad.

128
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,900
Uncle Wang, I'm not a child.
I'm almost an intermediate senior warrior.

129
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,530
I can handle most of the
primary beast officers.

130
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:02,530
Primary beast officers? Very average.

131
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,300
Or I should say bad.

132
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,300
A true warrior master can handle a beast
of his own rank.

133
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,500
Some can even go kill
monsters of higher ranks.

134
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,230
You're physically
as strong as an intermediate senior warrior.

135
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,260
But you can only deal with primary beast officers.
You need more training.

136
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,100
Your body condition is good.
With your talent

137
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,600
and the support of your parents,

138
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,460
you still might
be a God of War in 10 years.

139
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,730
When you become a God of war

140
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,600
and join the Palace of Gods,
then people will respect you

141
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,960
instead of treating you
like some stuck up young master.

142
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,760
(Palace of Gods.)

143
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,260
Got it.
Thanks, Uncle Wang and Uncle Li .

144
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,800
Master, what is Palace of Gods?

145
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,030
You'll be told
when you're an advanced senior warrior.

146
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:04,000
It's possible that
you will make it someday.

147
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,600
It's okay if I give you a heads up.

148
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,400
Palace of Gods is a group of

149
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,630
Gods of War or
even stronger warriors

150
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:17,400
from all base cities of
the five great powers.

151
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,300
All Gods of War in the world
are members of the Palace of Gods.

152
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,130
The world's most powerful warrior, Hong,

153
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,900
and the second most powerful one,
Thunder, are the creators.

154
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,500
(Hong and Thunder.)

155
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,860
(So the world's first and second best
aren't just competitors.)

156
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,600
Palace of Gods is
the temple of the warriors.

157
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:40,100
Its purpose is to pursue
the limits of the human body,

158
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,800
and to wipe out
all the monsters on earth.

159
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:48,600
All right, Li Wei,
you'd better get out of here now.

160
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,830
Soon this place will be at war.

161
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:52,700
War?

162
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,200
Wang and I are gonna fight an iron dragon,
an advanced beast general.

163
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,000
Advanced beast general.

164
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:04,200
This operation is dangerous.
Miles around would be involved.

165
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,000
(Two Gods of War hunt
an advanced beast general together.)

166
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,360
Three months ago,
the iron dragon led monsters

167
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,200
to raid the Southeast Army Supply Depot,

168
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,400
resulting in massive casualties.

169
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:19,560
Over a thousand men were eaten
by the iron dragon in battle.

170
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,400
We think it was preparing for spawning.

171
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,630
Spawning? Then its offspring...

172
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,130
Will grow into another beast general.

173
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:33,500
It's estimated that the iron dragon
laid its eggs earlier.

174
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,000
This weakens it.

175
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,900
Now is the perfect time to kill it.
