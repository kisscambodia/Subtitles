00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,300

27
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,900

(My career as a warrior is over.)

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,060
(The moon wolf!)

30
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,700
(Seeing from its size,
it should be an advanced beast officer.)

31
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,060
(I got you!)

32
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,130
(Ah!)

33
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,360

taught you about karma.)

00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,600

35
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,800
(Ah!)

36
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:58,120
=Episode 11=

37
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,460
(Zhang Zehu, it's okay you come at me.)

38
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,660
(But I won't let you set my team up!)

39
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,300
Drop your weapons,
or we will fire.

40
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,560
Hump!

41
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,460
Let's go.

42
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,200
Captain, do we just
let them go like this?

43
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,830
Pan Ya's a snake.

44
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,360
We can report it to the Security Bureau.

45
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,600
But without proof, we'll get nowhere.

46
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,100
Zhang Ke's injuries are worrisome.

47
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,400
We've had someone sent
the girl back to the city.

48
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,960
For your team member here,

49
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,200
he may need a new plan for life.

50
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,400
Huya Squad!

51
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,500
It's fine. Captain. I've been thinking
about retirement for a long time.

52
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,160
I've been busy with missions
since my daughter was born.

53
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,800
I am not a good father.

54
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,400
Maybe this is the time.

55
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,830
Captain, I still want to be a warrior...

56
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,200
Alas.

57
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,000
It's not easy being a warrior.

58
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,760
Dead bodies of warriors are sent to
my tiny infirmary every day.

59
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,460
There's always a way.

60
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,730
Let's check with the HR Alliance Mall

61
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,500
and see if there's a robotic arm
for warriors.

62
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,460
Captain, thank you for your kindness.

63
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,430
How can a robotic arm be
as strong and fast as a warrior's?

64
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,230
(Robotic arm, then Hua...)

65
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,000
Hello, she's back? That's good to know.

66
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,330
Yes. Yes. It won't happen again.

67
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,660
Okay, thanks. Bye.

68
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,800
Miss Xu is home. Thank you so much.

69
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:25,130
(Why does Mr. Wang
care so much about her safety?)

70
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,600
We've made payment to you, Captain Gao.
Please check it.

71
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,330
OK.

72
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,300
There's something I'd like
to ask, Mr. Wang.

73
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,860
The robotic arm?

74
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,130
One of my team members was seriously
injured in this mission.

75
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,230
If we can't get him a good robotic arm,
I'm afraid...

76
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,830
I'm sorry to hear that.

77
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,700
But our best robotic arm can only
help him get daily life back.

78
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,030
It's not for warriors.

79
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,230
But...

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,660
But what?

81
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:09,060
For all I know, there is the treasure
that can regenerate broken arm.

82
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,400
What is it?

83
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,760
(Regenerate? Then Hua...)

84
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,710
(SAT 29/06 25° SUN 30/06 22°
MON 01/07 24°)

85
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,200
It's called the water of life.

86
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:21,100
It's made from the spirit of Earth King,
the King Beast.

87
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,700
It costs as much as 30 billion each.

88
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,200
Thirty billion!

89
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,560
But there is nowhere you can buy it.

90
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,260
Alas.

91
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,160
Let's not get carried away.

92
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,230
It's good to retire
and be an instructor.

93
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,800
At least, I have more
time for my family.

94
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,630
Mr. Wang, this time,
apart from rescuing your people,

95
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,760
we have taken down some monsters
that pose a threat to the city.

96
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,430
Ah?

97
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:56,400
The moon wolf! You killed a moon wolf?

98
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:56,960
Oh.

99
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,160
We were being lucky.

100
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,000
The moon wolves are hunters.

101
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,760
It's far more dangerous than
any other beast at the same level.

102
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,760
It was an advanced beast officer.

103
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,860
It's as dangerous as a general beast.

104
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,200
I could not beat it
if it was as strong as usual.

105
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,360
And we have paid a great price.

106
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,060
We will pay a good price to you

107
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,360
as you killed a moon wolf.

108
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,200
Taking all the other monsters
you've killed into account,

109
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:30,200
how about a billion dollar as reward?

110
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,800
That would do.

111
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,930
Zhang Ke. This is to celebrate
your retirement.

112
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,630
From now on, you'll be Instructor Zhang
of the Extreme Martial Club.

113
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,660
We've been set up by Huya Squad.

114
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,830
I'm lucky I only lost one arm.

115
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,100
Thank you, Captain

116
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,930
and Luo Feng. You saved
the day and my life.

117
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,730
Don't say that, Zhang.
As a Spirit Master,

118
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,100
I didn't notice what
Huya Squad was up to,

119
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,000
so you have to retire early.

120
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,830
You saved my life.
You can't blame yourself!

121
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,100
The future of the Fire
Hammer Team depends on you!

122
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:18,530
Yes. Luo Feng is a Spirit Master
who grows much faster than others.

123
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:22,560
We're going to kick
Huya Squad's ass in no time!

124
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:23,900
Speaking of which,

125
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,430
Huya Squad and we are at odds now.

126
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,630
They are stronger than us.

127
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,200
Pan Ya and Zhang Zehu are scheming.

128
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,960
I'm afraid they're going to retaliate.

129
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,300
I wouldn't worry about it.

130
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:46,260
The state and the club will
protect the veterans and their families.

131
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,930
But you guys...

132
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,200
It's true that the threat of Huya Squad
must be taken seriously.

133
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,860
I have a proposal for you to consider.

134
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,430
Class A genetic agentia?

135
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:00,800
Yeah.

136
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,730
Genetic agentia optimizes human genes.

137
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,500
Class A genetic agentia

138
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,300
can increase the warrior's
strength greatly in a short time.

139
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:15,400
I'm confident that in two months,
you'll reach senior warriors level.

140
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,100
Of course, the downside is that
once the agentia takes effect,

141
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,730
it's nearly impossible for
you to further improve yourself.

142
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,700
Luo Feng. You're young
and you're a Spirit Master.

143
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:29,830
You have a big future.
You don't need this.

144
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,930
But this agentia...

145
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,750
It's available at Extreme Mall
and very expensive.

146
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,000
I have a friend who's a senior warrior.

147
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,200
He can buy it at a lower price.

148
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,060
I'll take it.

149
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,500
Count us in. We're not young anymore.

150
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:53,400
Primary senior warriors
are the best thing for us.

151
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,200
Okay, I'll reach to my friend later.

152
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,460
All of us would be senior warriors!

153
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,100
Mom, Dad.

154
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,050
Honey, what happened to your arm?

155
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,500
It's all right. I'm home safe and sound.

156
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:41,760
My girl. Daddy will play with you
every day from now on, OK?

157
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,200
(Zhang, I'll make Zhang
Zehu and his team pay!)

158
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,700
=Swallowed Star=

159
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,630
(Since the first battle
in the wilderness,)

160
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:27,360
(I've improved a lot in Genetic Energy
Practices. I gotta practice more.)

161
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,850
(I've mastered the first
stage of Nine thundering sabre.)

162
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:37,900
(I'm a Spirit Master. So I'm as good
as an intermediate senior warrior.)

163
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,900
(I can't rely too much on that.
My priority is physical fitness.)

164
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,400
(I immediately started practice when
I come home. I haven't taken a shower.)

165
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:57,660
Captain.

166
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,600
Luo Feng. There's a nice item for you
at the HR Alliance Mall. Come.

167
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,260
S9 flycutter?

168
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,100
I contacted my friend who just
came back from the wilderness.

169
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,950
These are part of the collection
from the beast generals they killed.

170
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,430
Beast generals!

171
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:22,950
They are smart and
hate warriors very much.

172
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,050
When they kill a warrior,

173
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,350
they will collect the
warrior's weapons as trophies.

174
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,450
For them, these trophies
are their badges.

175
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,500
I see.

176
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,400
Your flycutters were destroyed
in battle with the moon wolf.

177
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,600
It's not about your skill,
but the quality of the weapon.

178
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,130
Luo Feng, you're a Spirit Master.

179
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,600
The quality of your flycutters
determines your power.

180
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,000
These six flycutters are my gift to you.

181
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,200
I can't accept it. I will pay.

182
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,100
Zhang Ke's retirement
did make our team weaker.

183
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,650
But we wouldn't be afraid of Huya Squad
if you could improve fast.

184
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,500
All right, I'll take that.
Thank you, Captain.

185
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,300
I'll work hard to catch
up with the team.

186
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:16,000
You haven't got changed
since you got back from the wilderness.

187
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,600
Ha ha!

188
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,550
I was busy practicing and forgot.

189
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,800
(Xu Xin)

190
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,000
You just came back yesterday.
Why not take some rest?

191
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,400
I'd rather work here
as there is too much going on at home.

192
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,300
Work?

193
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,460
Oh.

194
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,600
In addition to her lab job,

195
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,360
Miss Xu is also a part-time
manager at our mall.

196
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,160
Luo Feng, thank you
for bringing me back.

197
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,600
I'll catch up with you
when I'm done with my work.

198
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:56,800
Where's Xin?

199
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,130
Oh.

200
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,200
Mr. Xu, there you are.
Miss. Xu just went up.

201
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,400
You are?

202
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,300
(HR)
I'm Luo Feng.

203
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,000
Luo Feng, from the Fire Hammer Team?

204
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,700
Thank you for bringing my sister

205
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,400
back from the wilderness. I'm Xu Gang.

206
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,300
Hello.

207
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,060
(So he's Xu Xin's brother.)

208
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,000
Xin went to the data room?
I'll go find her.

209
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,360
Hump.

210
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,000
Who is this Xu Gang, Mr. Wang?

211
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,900
Oh, you don't know?

212
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,160
The Xu Family is a big family
in the HR Alliance.

213
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,550
The HR Alliance is an alliance of
nine super clans around the world.

214
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,550
These clans are supported by

215
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,150
over a dozen secondary clans
among the five states.

216
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:56,200
His clan is one of
the 12 clans in our state.

217
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,900
(Xu Xin comes from a powerful family.
I've never heard of it.)

218
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,033
(Emergency!)

219
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,450
(The beast general, giant rock bear
is approaching Jiangnan city fast.)

220
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,550
(It has breached
the military's first defense.)

221
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:47,000
(The beast general, giant rock bear
is approaching Jiangnan city fast.)

222
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,200
Calm down, we can't deal with it.

223
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,030
Captain.

224
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,360
(Ah, here come the warriors!)

225
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,200
(It's Lu Gang, the God of War.)

226
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,400
(He saved the pilot from the fighter
destroyed by the giant rock bear.)

227
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,000
God of War.

228
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:35,030
-It's the Fluxay.
-Fluxay from the Nine Thundering Sabre.

229
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,800
(He won! Defeated the giant rock bear!)

230
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:39,230
(God of War also practiced
Nine Thundering Sabre.)

231
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:45,150
That's the God of War.
Much better than the ordinary ones.

232
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,260
Even our clan wants him badly.

233
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,060
Although a 21-year-old young,
intermediate senior warrior

234
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,960
and a young man from a leading family
in capital are after Xin,

235
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:01,130
I still think Xin deserves better.

236
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,500
Don't you agree, Luo Feng?

237
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:09,400
Mr. Xu, you don't seem to
be fond of a warrior like me.

238
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,800
Of course I'd respect God of War, but...

239
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,850
You're saying this
to get me to back off

240
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,300
and give up your sis. Don't worry.

241
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,830
I'll be the best warrior,

242
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,600
a true champion.

243
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:31,100
Then you'll be ashamed of
how little you thought of me today.

244
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,130
Coming from the same family,

245
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,260
Xu Xin has never been arrogant
because of her background.

246
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:43,060
Mark my words, pride and prejudice
often blindfold many.

247
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:54,160
(Giant rock bear)

248
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,760

(Alone.)

281
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,060
(Try to get back before dark.)

282
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,960
(How many monsters did you kill?)

283
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,330
(Hi, Luo Feng.)

284
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:14,760
(Something's wrong.)

285
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,300
(Chen. There's an incident in 0201.)

286
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,960

Nine Thundering Sabre.)

people left in the city.)

far from enough.)

289
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,800
(I'll find a strong hand)

290
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,060
(and make them die miserably.)

291
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,530
