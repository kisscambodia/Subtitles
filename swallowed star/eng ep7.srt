(Based on the novel "Swallowed Star".)

25
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,770
(Previously on Swallowed Star)
(It's good. You've improved a lot)

26
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,940
(after a month's special training.)

27
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,640
(Welcome to the Extreme Martial Club.)

28
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,420
(You can move into
the villa for warriors today.)

29
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,190
(Your task)

30
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,880
(is to go there to
collect the supplies.)

31
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,400
(We will be monitoring
you all the time.)

32
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,290
(If the warriors-to-be
attack each other,)

33
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,640
(we will arrest them on the spot.)

34
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,180
(The air is filled with smell of blood.)

35
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,620
(Next goal.)

36
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,350
(What? Golden eagle?)

37
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,560
(Terminate the test now!)

38
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,910
=Episode 7=

39
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,760
Usually, only Level-H to Level-F
monsters would be out there.

40
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,630
How come there's
a golden eagle of Level-D?

41
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,810
Terminate the test now!

42
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,000
No, let it be.

43
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,330
Director Zhuge.

44
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:13,790
This golden eagle is a newly born larva.

45
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,750
It's probably somewhere
between Level E to F.

46
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,100
As long as they play their cards right,

47
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,760
they should be able to escape
if not defeating it.

48
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,280
Even so,

49
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,340
we should get rid of
this hidden trouble soon.

50
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,750
Wouldn't it be better to leave that
to the warriors-to-be?

51
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,760
Who is the nearest warrior-to-be
to the golden eagle?

52
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,510
The signal shows it's Luo Feng.

53
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:41,590
Luo Feng.

54
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,460
Bring it on!

55
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,620
(It used the body of a one-horned boar
to shield and attack.)

56
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,600
(So intelligent!)

57
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,560
(Is golden eager invincible?)

58
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,710
(There must be another way.)

59
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,340
Missed it.

60
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:11,910
(Come on!)

61
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,170
(Come at me at full speed.)

62
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,300
(I won't make the
same mistake this time.)

63
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,530
Luo Feng.

64
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,530
Well, this kid is lucky.

65
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,030
He eluded the deadly beak

66
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:04,980
and the flying sabre
fell right next to him.

67
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,650
Otherwise,
he'd have been ripped to pieces.

68
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:08,780
No.

69
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,300
The golden eager's flight path
is changed

70
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,810
by the flying sabre.

71
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,980
That's exactly why

72
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,000
he was "lucky".

73
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,830
It's well-planned.

74
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,630
He planned all that.

75
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,190
The golden eager's fatal attack

76
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,850
missed him by 1.5cm in the last minute.

77
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:39,790
Could it be...

78
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,630
The test is over. I'll announce
the list of qualified candidates.

79
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,790
Lv Fang collected
three samples and one supply.

80
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:05,320
Yang Wu collected
three samples and two supplies.

81
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:12,870
Luo Feng collected 36 samples
and five supplies.

82
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,640
Wan Dong collected 51 samples
and seven supplies.

83
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,550
So many!

84
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,780
Luo Feng. Chin up!

85
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,820
You are quite impressive!

86
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,300
There'll be plenty of chances for you
to beat him.

87
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,560
It's not on my mind at all.

88
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,040
That's the list of qualified candidates.

89
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,760
Congratulations! You are warriors now.

90
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,600
Yeah!

91
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,930
Yeah, we passed!

92
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,100
Bravo!

93
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,920
(Finally.)

94
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,480
Feng.

95
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,650
=Swallowed Star=

96
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:57,540
Dear new warrior, Luo Feng,
welcome to the House of the Extreme.

97
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,910
I'm your personal guide.

98
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,210
This is a place where
you can find information about warriors,

99
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,150
and buy all kinds of weapons, guidance,

100
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:19,650
special books, outfits, medicaments,
vehicles and so on.

101
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,760
When you become a real warrior,

102
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,410
you'll have the chance to learn about
Spirit Master.

103
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,010
Do you have information on
Spirit Master?

104
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,870
Based on your rank and permission,
I can show you the following:

105
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,740
(Warrior 101 database)
Spirit Masters are the most

106
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,930
gifted warriors.

107
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,760
There are two types of them.

108
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,140
(Telekinesis)
First, those who can control items.

109
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,890
They can control weapons
to attack from a distance.

110
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,400
(Psychic attack)
Second, those who master psychic attack.

111
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,220
They can attack opponents' spirits.

112
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,240
Attack on spirits.

113
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,600
The Spirit Master learn faster
than the average warriors

114
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,760
thanks to their Spirit Energy.

115
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,580
Usually, the Spirit Master
is about two grades

116
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,860
higher in the spirits
than the warrior of the same rank.

117
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,220
(So I'm as powerful as
an advanced senior warrior?)

118
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,220
That's all you're permitted to know
about the Spirit Master now.

119
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,580
Is there anything else
you'd like to know, Mr. Luo Feng?

120
00:10:23,017 --> 00:10:25,240
No. Show me the catalog,

121
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,940
special books on attacking skills.

122
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:28,450
OK.

123
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,700
(Misty sword.
Phantom knife tactic. Destruction)

124
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,410
(Feature)

125
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,580
Well.

126
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:36,910
(Category: swordsmanship.
Level: S. Price: 3 billion)

127
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,380
(Category: sabre skills. Level: SS.
Price: 10 billion)

128
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:37,910
(Category: marksmanship. Level: Top.
Price: 100 billion)

129
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,080
Oh, my god, it's so expensive.

130
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,650
Don't worry. You can buy it by stages.

131
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,260
Take Destruction for example.

132
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,230
It's from Hong, the world's strongest
warrior, and comes in six stages.

133
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,480
The world's strongest warrior, Hong.

134
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,800
Hong is the most powerful man
in the world today.

135
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,700
He's also the founder of the
Extreme Martial Club.

136
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,300
He alone can destroy a big nation.

137
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,540
Although it's the best marksmanship,

138
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,750
I'm good at sabre.

139
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:12,850
Nine thundering sabre.

140
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,200
It belongs to the second best warrior
in the world.

141
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,880
Thunder's ultimate sabre skills.
It's extremely difficult to master.

142
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,860
I'm good at sabre.

143
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,370
This is the most powerful one
in the world.

144
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,960
A qualified warrior fights hard
to be on top.

145
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,340
Purchase the first three stages
of the Nine thundering sabre.

146
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,230
Certified and purchased.

147
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,620
The first three stages will be
delivered within 24 hours.

148
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,510
Do you want to purchase
weapons and outfits?

149
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,750
(Extreme Mall)

150
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,870
Almost forgot about them.

151
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,180
(A-6, 20 million. Shield. B-5, 3 million.
O5 Series, 18 million. )

152
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,350
(Sabre A-6, 20 million)

153
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,270
Oh, my god, 20 million Huaxia dollars
isn't enough for these.

154
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:19,490
Luo Feng.

155
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:22,330
You are...?

156
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,610
My name is Chen Gu.

157
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,790
An advanced senior warrior
in Extreme Martial Club in Jiangnan.

158
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:31,050
General Instructor Wu asked me
to bring you this.

159
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,330
Nine thundering sabre. That's fast.

160
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,800
It requires a warrior to
deliver it in person?

161
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,290
It's for the best sabre skill
in the world.

162
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,790
Many people are after it.

163
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,370
It has to be delivered by
someone reliable.

164
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:51,300
And there are a few things
I'd like to tell you in person.

165
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,890
In person?

166
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,070
According to the rule, you can only

167
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,850
study this skill yourself.
No copying or reselling.

168
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:04,590
Or you will be wanted by the two
major martial clubs and all governments.

169
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:06,880
I see.

170
00:13:08,183 --> 00:13:09,200
And one more thing.

171
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,480
Luo Feng, one month ago,

172
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,610
you were in Yi'an detention house,
right?

173
00:13:15,483 --> 00:13:16,700
They have looked into it.

174
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,370
I didn't pick a fight.

175
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,640
I know. It's been found that

176
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,880
a young man named Zhang Haobai
was behind it.

177
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,420
Assassination of a warrior-to-be
is a felony.

178
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,380
He might be sentenced to jail for
20 to 30 years or face death penalty.

179
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,980
His uncle, Zhang Zehu contacted
Extreme Martial Club

180
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,000
and wanted to settle out of court.

181
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,570
Out of court?

182
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,970
Zhang Zehu is a warrior of
Thunder and Lightning Martial Club.

183
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,580
I know him a little.

184
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,040
Luo Feng, don't worry.

185
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,080
I'll go with you.

186
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:08,600
General Instructor Wu Tong.
It was my nephew's fault.

187
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,820
But it didn't cause much harm.

188
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:16,960
I'm willing to pay five million Huaxia dollars
for compensation.

189
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,450
Five million?

190
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,860
You think you can bully a rookie
just like that?

191
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,830
You said it was a negotiation.

192
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,780
But you came
with three members of Huya Squad.

193
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,500
Aren't you throwing your weight about?

194
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,960
Do you think we're easy to mess with?

195
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,770
How much do you want?

196
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,970
Well, 50 million will do.

197
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,090
50 million?

198
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,850
And your nephew should apologize
to Luo Feng's father.

199
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,050
Get down on his knees and apologize.

200
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,970
Luo Feng has joined
Extreme Martial Club.

201
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,760
Of course, we need to get justice for
his family.

202
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,030
You're crossing the line!

203
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:03,280
OK, 50 million is fine.

204
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,370
But getting down on his knees
and apologizing is too much.

205
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,780
It's not up to you or me.

206
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,870
Only one person has the final say.

207
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:19,620
Mr. Zhang Zehu,
thank you for coming here in person.

208
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,040
But there's no way I'll agree
to settle out of court.

209
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,370
Zhang Haobai hurt me. That's fine.

210
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,070
But he hurt my innocent family.

211
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,270
I will never forgive him.

212
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,550
He must be brought to justice!

213
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,420
Does this kid know the rules?

214
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,680
We respect Luo Feng's decision.

215
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:41,780
Damn.

216
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,050
You're in Extreme Martial Club.
Behave yourselves.

217
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,050
You should know that I will be

218
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,660
a senior warrior very soon.

219
00:15:59,170 --> 00:15:59,930
So what?

220
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,990
Alright, you're ballsy!

221
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,210
Let's go.

222
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,550
Impressive. You're neither haughty
nor humble in front of

223
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,760
the advanced soldiers.

224
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:19,200
Thank you, Chen, Instructor Jiang
and General Instructor Wu.

225
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,790
Don't mention it. We're family.

226
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,450
But it's a pity.
I really need that 50 million.

227
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,510
I spent most of my money
on the sabre skill.

228
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,600
Now I can't even afford my outfits.

229
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,500
It's nothing, I have the reward points.

230
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,290
I can buy them at a 50% discount.

231
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,940
I'll buy it for you and
you transfer the money to me later.

232
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,780
It works that way?

233
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,820
Of course, we're on the same team.

234
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,370
It's nothing.

235
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,360
Same team?

236
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,530
Director Zhuge asked me to put
you in a team of senior warriors.

237
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,160
After thorough consideration, I decided
to put you on the Fire Hammer Team.

238
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,160
I'm the lieutenant of the team.

239
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,540
I'll take care of you.

240
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,310
Of course, I should warn you

241
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:09,020
the missions are often
extremely dangerous.

242
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:13,840
If you're bad on your first mission
or you slow your team down,

243
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,460
we'll have to kick you out.

244
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,250
I see.

245
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:31,200
I can't believe he escaped the attacks
from the golden eager.

246
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:35,920
I will get rid of him sooner or later.
