(Previously on Swallowed Star)
(I want you all to work hard!)

26
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,970
(We all want to be warriors.)

27
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,760
(Let's compete.)

28
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,760
(Don't you worry about that.)

29
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,450
(You know he's good.)

30
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,280
(Yes, Young Master.
We found Luo Feng's residence.)

31
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,940
(Leave your right hand here,
and we'll let you go.)

32
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,510
(They are not here to fight.)

33
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,110
(What if I testify?)

34
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,170
(Mr. Jiang.)

35
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,790
(There's still time, I...)

36
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,890
(-What's wrong with you, Feng?
-Luo Feng!)

37
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,560
(I will sign up for the test of
warrior-to-be.)

=Episode 3=

39
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,810
(Tencent Video)

40
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,180
I'm heading out.

41
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,570
Dad, why do you leave so early today?

42
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,680
I've got a big job today
and I can make few hundred bucks more.

43
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,970
Feng, good luck!

44
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,340
Thanks.

45
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,100
Dad, today is a big day.

46
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,810
Don't miss the good news from brother.

47
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,540
Rest assured. If I pass the test,

48
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,960
you'll be the first to know.

49
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,840
Did you hear it?
They asked you to bring your phone.

50
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,620
Yes, it's with me.

51
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,760
It's about time. I'm leaving, too.

52
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,540
Let me introduce you.

53
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,750
This is Yang Wu.

54
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,330
He'll also take the test today.

55
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,360
Instructor Jiang said that you just
finished College Entrance Examination.

56
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,170
Are you only 18?

57
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,620
He's young, but there's a good chance
he could pass the test.

58
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,260
Hey, kid,
you've got a big future ahead of you!

59
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:14,240
I'm overpraised. Yang, you're so strong.

60
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,820
I'm sure you will pass the test.

61
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,000
Alas.

62
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,040
It's not about who's stronger.

63
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,520
It's more about comprehensive quality
and the speed to react.

64
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,280
Uh, Yang. What's this test like?

65
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,080
Hey, you'll know it soon.

66
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,380
To be the warrior,
it won't be easy to pass the test.

67
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,920
There will be a field test after that.

68
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,050
You should take every test seriously.

69
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,060
(Looks like I need to work harder.)

70
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,080
Oh, Luo Feng.

71
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,100
Have you decided what to do
after you pass the test?

72
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,370
Well, I haven't thought about that.

73
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,610
Instructor Jiang says you're talented.

74
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,640
Generally, there are four choices
for the warriors.

75
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,270
The first is to join the army,

76
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,940
protecting the country and people
from monsters.

77
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,180
The second is to join a martial club,

78
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,920
taking the initiative
to attack the monsters.

79
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,560
The third is to join a syndicate,

80
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,060
helping with the recovery
of industrial economy.

81
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,470
The fourth is to be a mercenary,

82
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,160
maintaining order in
remote and volatile areas.

83
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,210
Take me as an example,
I'll join the Extreme Martial Club.

84
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,320
Instructor Jiang, then...

85
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,450
I know.

86
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,170
As long as you become a warrior
and join our club,

87
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,360
we will provide you
with a detached villa

88
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,810
and at least
20,000 Chinese dollars a month.

89
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,390
Ha ha. I was afraid you might forget.

90
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,950
(A detached villa and a base salary
of 20,000 Chinese dollars per month.)

91
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,780
(A detached villa is worth
at least 200 million.)

92
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,190
(If I got the title of the warrior,)

93
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,190
(mom and Hua could...)

94
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,090
(Alas.)

95
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:56,040
(She's got enrolled in a top college
and will become a social elite.)

96
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,040
(But I chose to be the warrior.)

97
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,640
(I'm afraid I'll never see her again.)

98
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,320
Guys, this is the form of
colleges you wish to go.

99
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,000
Now, I want you to fill it out.

100
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,950
(Luo Feng is absent today, too.)

101
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,060
What's up?

102
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,850
Young Master. It's done!

103
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,380
Okay, I'll be right back.

104
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,860
Zhang Haobai.
You haven't handed in your form!

105
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,860
Monitor. Please give Feng's form to me.

106
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,240
He's not coming today.

107
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,440
What happened to Luo Feng?
Wasn't he discharged?

108
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,950
Oh, it's nothing.

109
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,830
Feng is busy with the test of
warrior-to-be.

110
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,010
Wow, the test of warrior-to-be?

111
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:45,930
Ha ha.

112
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:49,230
You think Feng gave up because
he failed the exam?

113
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,080
He's not that kind of person.

114
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,870
Ah!

115
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,960
(Test of warrior-to-be?)

116
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,600
Luo Feng.

117
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,160
Yes.

118
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,960
Instructor Jiang.

119
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,890
We're almost there.

120
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,890
Yangzhou headquarters of martial clubs,
Extreme Martial Club.

121
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,100
(This is where the test will be held.)

122
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,330
(Master is also here.)

123
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,760
(This sword, is it...)

124
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,160
(him?)

125
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,100
I'm the chief instructor of
Yangzhou Extreme Martial Club, Wu Tong.

126
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,260
I'll host the test today.

127
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:36,280
Come on in. The exam's about to start.

128
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,550
(Test-in-process)

129
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,340
(This is the old world.)

130
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,440
(I could only see the old world
in base city from a distance.)

131
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,610
(These weapons...)

132
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,200
Pick a weapon. Here they come!

133
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,640
(They?)

134
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,220
One-horned boar. Iron-hair boar.

135
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,120
Shadowcat!

136
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,200
These are monsters!

137
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,420
Hum! Let's go!

138
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,210
(Calm down!)

139
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,160
(I can't be defeated here.)

140
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,520
Hey, buddy.

141
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,500
First time here?

142
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,330
Don't worry, it's very normal.
My name is Li...

143
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,500
A tiger mastiff!

144
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,800
(No, I'm not a coward.)

145
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,130
(Nice! The neck is the weakness
of the one-horned boar.)

146
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,610
(He can make quick adjustments
in such a condition,)

147
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,680
(this kid's got talent.)

148
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,520
Gee. The weapon is too heavy to use.

149
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,980
There are more monsters, over there!

150
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,740
Maybe the real test starts now.

151
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,440
=Swallowed Star=

152
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,280
(Transport Company of Luo's)

153
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,380
Oh,
Mr. Zhang's courtyard is so splendid!

154
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:45,040
Wish I could live
in a good house someday.

155
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,690
Stop daydreaming. Just get to work.

156
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,800
I want to go back to my sons soon.

157
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:53,720
Come on,
we all know you have two good sons.

158
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,620
One, two, three. Go!

159
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,080
Young Master, he's Luo Feng's father.

160
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,100
Ah, what's so sticky?

161
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,860
The danger index is 79,
it's just a monster of level G.

162
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,380
The test has always been difficult.
Better be careful.

163
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,560
The index is rising.

164
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,670
100, 150, 300, over 500 now!

165
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,850
It's coming!

166
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,170
Oh, no!

167
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,420
It's close.

168
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,060
Level E. The gold vulture!

169
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,640
What to do, Yang?

170
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,260
Run!

171
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,530
(Come on!)

172
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,430
(No. Bad timing!)

173
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,410
Instructor Jiang,
I'm sorry I didn't do well.

174
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,970
Luo Feng.

175
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,050
Yes.

176
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,450
I'm here to tell you
that you've passed this test.

177
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,760
What?

178
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,660
It doesn't require you
to kill all the monsters.

179
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,300
We are testing your fighting ability.

180
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,840
You get points by injuring the monsters
and avoiding their attacks.

181
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,700
From statistical analysis, we found that

182
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,070
your power reached 1,101 kilograms
when killing the tiger mastiff

183
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,440
and the speed was 28.6 meters per second

184
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,290
when you avoided attacks
from the gold vulture.

185
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,710
You did much better than
our base requirement.

186
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,240
With your extraordinary ability
to survive and kill,

187
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,990
you scored the highest.

188
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:13,390
(Candidates of the Warrior-to-be test.)

189
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,060
(Comprehensive Score)
Look.

190
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,960
(Luo Feng    Power:1,101 kg    Total:11 )

191
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,170
Sorry to keep you waiting.

192
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,560
(Candidates of the Warrior-to-be test.
Luo Feng.)

193
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,100
First of all, congratulations.

194
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,440
The field test

195
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,760
will be held on the first day
of the next month.

196
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,420
Please prepare yourselves.

197
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,080
Yes.

198
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,340
I have to warn you

199
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,450
that you might get

200
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,310
injured or killed

201
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,620
in the field test.

202
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,400
Got it.

203
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,200
Now, follow me to get your rewards
of being the warrior-to-be.

204
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,580
Oh, there's a reward for
those who have passed the test?

205
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,160
Of course.

206
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,690
Otherwise,

207
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,290
you won't be able to
attend the field test

208
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,400
with your current strength.

209
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,170
The field test is so hard.

210
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,940
So what's the reward?

211
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:07,810
Genetic Energy Practices.

212
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,560
(Dad)
(Calling)

213
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,880
(Can't get through.
Dad's still at work?)

214
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,670
I remembered he said he was going to...

215
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,670
You've crushed my ground.

216
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:33,610
It's from South Mountain. A piece costs
hundred thousand. Can you afford it? ‬

217
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,500
I told you the crack was there before.
Why did you push us?

218
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,410
Right!

219
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,980
Don't you play rough with me.

220
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,220
Mind where you are right now.

221
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,020
Young man, how could you do that?

222
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,080
You guys, shut them down.

223
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,900
(I'll show you what happens
if you mess with me.)

224
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,810

(I'll take it as
I've heard nothing today.)

00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,100
(We got a report of a break-in.)

259
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,550
(Is there a misunderstanding?)

00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,360

You're about to get your ass kicked.)

(He'll be released someday.)
