00:00:27,867 --> 00:00:32,100
(Based on the novel "Swallowed Star".)

2
00:00:35,433 --> 00:00:39,467
=Episode 1=

3
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,750
(The end of the world is coming!
Where should the human go?)

4
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:08,867
(Wu)

5
00:01:53,136 --> 00:01:56,992
File No. TJ210324.

6
00:01:57,808 --> 00:02:00,160
Name: Great Nirvana.

7
00:02:00,864 --> 00:02:03,680
Welcome to consult. Please follow me.

8
00:02:04,688 --> 00:02:09,360
(It all started in the summer at the end
of the old century,)

9
00:02:09,744 --> 00:02:14,768
(more than 2 billion people worldwide
died of RR virus.)

10
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,410
(Fire exit)

11
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,360
(First case of viral mutation was found
in animals infected in the Middle East.)

12
00:02:26,608 --> 00:02:29,632
(Unknown species invaded America.)

13
00:02:30,512 --> 00:02:34,960
(North America Coalition announced
abandonment of 13 East Coast states.)

14
00:02:38,272 --> 00:02:43,728
(RR virus brought a new
intelligent species, the Monster.)

15
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:56,752
(Then, mankind has entered the era of
Great Nirvana.)

16
00:03:10,144 --> 00:03:12,000
(Proposal No. 62:)

17
00:03:13,072 --> 00:03:15,392
("Comprehensive Nuclear Program".)

18
00:03:18,528 --> 00:03:20,400
(Scientists believed that)

19
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,868
(if all the nuclear bombs were launched,)

20
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,134
(the earth would be totally destroyed
three times.)

21
00:03:28,016 --> 00:03:30,864
(However, that is not the case.)

22
00:03:31,648 --> 00:03:36,352
(65 million years ago,
the earth was hit by an asteroid)

23
00:03:36,656 --> 00:03:39,856
(whose energy equalled to
hundreds of thousands of nuclear bombs.)

24
00:03:40,032 --> 00:03:42,240
(But the earth was not destroyed.)

25
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,240
(Einstein once said)

26
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,952
("I don't know what weapons we will
use in the Third World War,)

27
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:54,528
(but I'm sure
we will use stones in the Fourth.")

28
00:03:55,232 --> 00:03:59,344
(It's us that will be destroyed,)

29
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,184
(along with human civilization.)

30
00:04:01,456 --> 00:04:03,328
(We always use nuclear weapon)

31
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:06,624
(as the trump and value it)

32
00:04:06,896 --> 00:04:10,496
(thinking that the huge mushroom cloud)

33
00:04:10,496 --> 00:04:12,496
(could solve all the problems.)

34
00:04:12,944 --> 00:04:14,496
(But we all see that)

35
00:04:14,496 --> 00:04:17,360
(plants grew one year after
the bombing in)

36
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,920
(Hiroshima and Nagasaki.)

37
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,488
(Even in the nuclear test site
in Novaya Zemlya,)

38
00:04:23,712 --> 00:04:27,920
(vegetation and wildlife have fully restored.)

39
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,128
(The power of nuclear weapons)

40
00:04:30,288 --> 00:04:33,424
(is far less powerful than we thought.)

41
00:04:33,712 --> 00:04:36,784
(A thousand bombs failed
to stop the Monsters.)

42
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:40,544
(The United Nations declared
a state of emergency.)

43
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,088
(Please take refuge
in the underground base immediately.)

44
00:04:46,976 --> 00:04:49,424
(If there is a global nuclear war,)

45
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,816
(it is human civilization
that is most likely)

46
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,544
(to be destroyed.)

47
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:04,367
(Survived or destroyed?
The last homes for mankind)

48
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:23,328
(Human beings survived
in the Great Nirvana.)

49
00:05:25,872 --> 00:05:27,248
(Although many countries were occupied,)

50
00:05:27,552 --> 00:05:31,744
(with military strength, technology and
our indomitable willpower,)

51
00:05:31,984 --> 00:05:34,224
(five major countries survived.)

52
00:05:37,824 --> 00:05:39,616
(We formed the Earth Alliance)

53
00:05:39,984 --> 00:05:42,976
(and established bases in 23 regions.)

54
00:05:44,256 --> 00:05:47,392
(Human beings are always here.)

55
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,576
(The most important reason)

56
00:05:58,912 --> 00:06:05,088
(is the warrior, of course.)

57
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,467
(Five years ago)

58
00:09:28,112 --> 00:09:29,024
Feng.

59
00:09:29,776 --> 00:09:30,656
Luo Feng.

60
00:09:31,392 --> 00:09:34,720
In any case,
the old world is just spectacular.

61
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,856
I still can't believe

62
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,008
that human beings survived
in the Great Nirvana.

63
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,216
Indeed, human civilization was almost
destroyed that time.

64
00:09:46,032 --> 00:09:47,216
Unexpectedly,

65
00:09:47,472 --> 00:09:49,920
the Earth Alliance formed by
the five major countries survived.

66
00:09:50,272 --> 00:09:52,944
A whole new civilization started.

67
00:09:53,856 --> 00:09:57,136
All thanks to them.

68
00:09:57,776 --> 00:10:00,608
The heroes known as warriors.

69
00:10:01,728 --> 00:10:03,616
Only the strong warriors

70
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:05,424
can explore the old world.

71
00:10:05,952 --> 00:10:09,136
I'll be one of them in the future!

72
00:10:09,136 --> 00:10:13,136
Feng, your skill is outstanding and
you're diligent.

73
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,648
It's just a matter of time
before you become the warrior.

74
00:10:16,688 --> 00:10:19,008
After all,
there is still a long way to go.

75
00:10:19,504 --> 00:10:22,256
My first goal is next month's
college entrance examination.

76
00:10:22,784 --> 00:10:24,592
I plan to go to the Military Academy.

77
00:10:24,944 --> 00:10:25,808
After all,

78
00:10:25,808 --> 00:10:28,432
for poor students like us,

79
00:10:28,432 --> 00:10:30,432
getting subsidies and free education

80
00:10:30,432 --> 00:10:32,560
is the best we can do for our family.

81
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,984
Studying in the Military Academy

82
00:10:33,984 --> 00:10:36,336
helps to improve yourself and
become a warrior.

83
00:10:37,408 --> 00:10:40,016
Don't forget me, brother.

84
00:10:41,136 --> 00:10:41,904
Wei Wen.

85
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,232
Did you see something

86
00:10:43,232 --> 00:10:44,928
flying through just now?

87
00:10:45,168 --> 00:10:46,976
It's like a flying Monster.

88
00:10:47,472 --> 00:10:48,768
Impossible.

89
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:51,376
After the Great Nirvana,

90
00:10:51,536 --> 00:10:53,824
no Mutant Monster could
get close to the shield.

91
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,392
Was I wrong?

92
00:10:57,936 --> 00:11:00,560
Forget it. Let's go back.

93
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:09,567
(Warning)

94
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,767
(Highest alert)

95
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,336
Sir! The Mutant Monster has
crossed No Man's Land.

96
00:11:16,336 --> 00:11:17,744
Intercept now!

97
00:11:19,376 --> 00:11:20,576
What is our target?

98
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,680
Black Crowned Golden Eagle.
It ranks third in the Eagle Monsters.

99
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,128
Flying at 3.9 times the speed of sound.

100
00:11:26,128 --> 00:11:29,968
Its feather is harder than the diamond,
as hard as third-level chrome.

101
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,360
From the image,
the wingspan is 36 meters,

102
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,832
the body length reaches 21 meters.

103
00:11:34,832 --> 00:11:36,080
Adult. Grade S.

104
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,904
Grade S. How far is it?

105
00:11:37,904 --> 00:11:38,736
A thousand km away.

106
00:11:38,736 --> 00:11:41,136
According to the speed of
Black Stork Golden Eagle of Mach 3.9,

107
00:11:41,488 --> 00:11:42,960
it will reach in 15 minutes.

108
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,792
What about the fighters?

109
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:45,184
Attack in five minutes.

110
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,472
The target's in sight. Request to fire.

111
00:11:49,472 --> 00:11:50,608
Request approved.

112
00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:09,867
(Lost)

113
00:12:18,096 --> 00:12:19,568
Shall we call out the warrior?

114
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,440
Yes. Hope it's not too late.

115
00:12:25,472 --> 00:12:29,616
(38th anniversary of Long March hero,
Dong Nanbiao's sacrifice is being held.)

116
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:31,968
(Wreaths are laid in all martial clubs
across the country.)

117
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,160
(National Research Institute has made
a breakthrough in RR virus research.)

118
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,824
(It can reduce its survival time
in the air by 30 minutes.)

119
00:12:39,824 --> 00:12:42,656
Is the breakthrough in RR virus research
meaningful?

120
00:12:42,992 --> 00:12:44,448
(Tencent Video)
The Great Nirvana is over.

121
00:12:44,752 --> 00:12:48,656
Of course. Humans are infected with
the RR virus and produce antibodies.

122
00:12:48,912 --> 00:12:50,928
That's why we gained
unprecedented power.

123
00:12:51,568 --> 00:12:55,088
In some way,
it made the powerful warriors.

124
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:59,056
When we talk about warriors,
your eyes shine.

125
00:13:00,064 --> 00:13:02,656
Forget it. Let's live in the moment.

126
00:13:02,896 --> 00:13:04,576
Goals are good,

127
00:13:04,752 --> 00:13:07,376
but it's too far away from us now.

128
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:10,048
I went to the wrong classroom,
and they were all staring at me.

129
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,112
We're going to graduate.
It doesn't feel real.

130
00:13:14,432 --> 00:13:17,040
Oh, do you hate to leave someone?

131
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,128
I'm not.

132
00:13:26,384 --> 00:13:27,568
Oh, here he is.

133
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,568
We are leaving now.

134
00:13:29,568 --> 00:13:30,896
See you after the exam. Bye.

135
00:13:30,896 --> 00:13:32,320
Seize the chance!

136
00:13:42,064 --> 00:13:44,176
Xu Xin, I'll take you home.

137
00:13:44,768 --> 00:13:45,936
(Zhang Haobai.)

138
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,688
Are you blind? Don't you see my car?

139
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,668
(Sparkly Studio)

140
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,368
Damn! Take cover!

141
00:15:57,888 --> 00:15:59,616
The warrior killed the Mutant Monster.

142
00:16:01,136 --> 00:16:03,488
The crisis is over,
and radar is being repaired.

143
00:16:03,984 --> 00:16:05,456
(Only one shot.)

144
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,808
(This is the power of the warrior.)

145
00:16:11,424 --> 00:16:13,344
(So incomparable.)

146
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:16,240
(I've decided)

147
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,304
(to be)

148
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,268
