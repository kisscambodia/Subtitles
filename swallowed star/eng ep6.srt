(Be good, we will only break
one arm and leg of you.)

27
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,450

28

30
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,210
(Is this the extremely rare
Spirit Energy the instructor mentioned?)

31
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,960
(Mr. Luo Feng, you can go home today.)

32
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,160
(If he dares to mess with me,
I'll make sure he suffers.)

33
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,520
(Your goal is not within the fence.)

34
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,800
(You want to protect the world.
I'll help you with it.)

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,260
=Episode 6=

36
00:03:13,683 --> 00:03:14,480
Mr. Zhu?

37
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,980
(You have new mail, open or close)
Director, here's a document for you.

38
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,000
(Processing. Please be careful.)

39
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,870
It's good. You've improved a lot

40
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,870
after a month's special training.

41
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,160
There's a good chance that you would
pass the field test tomorrow.

42
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,350
Yeah, but I'm not good enough.

43
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,490
Instructor Jiang,
your speed is amazing.

44
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,440
You avoided all my attacks,
barely moving your feet.

45
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,310
It's not about speed.
It's Micro-Level Body Movement.

46
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,070
Micro-Level Body Movement?

47
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,310
There are four levels of
body movements in warriors' world.

48
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,350
Basic level, micro level, perfect level
and superb level.

49
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,900
Micro body movement means

50
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,570
you predict rivals' moves
by observing their movement,

51
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,370
and avoid their attacks with
minimal movements.

52
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,640
It's a skill built
on numerous combat experience.

53
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,530
What? This brilliant skill
is only on the second level?

54
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,440
It's not a complicated skill.

55
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,860
Most senior warriors have mastered it.

56
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,650
Senior warriors?

57
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,880
Oh, you don't know, right?

58
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,320
There are also
hierarchies among warriors.

59
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,070
According to the grading system,

60
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:47,320
there are soldiers, senior warriors,
and the rare God of War.

61
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,550
Each level is subdivided into 3 levels:
primary, intermediate and advanced.

62
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,420
Generally, warrior becomes junior
soldier once passing the test.

63
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,040
Usually,
you can defeat them with hot weapons.

64
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,470
Senior warriors are not afraid of
hot weapons.

65
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,200
Their mental speed

66
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,330
is far faster than
the fastest guns we have.

67
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,040
Their body movements are perfect.

68
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,410
Next is the God of War.

69
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,140
They are as fast as lightning,
and they can smash buildings.

70
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,490
They're the real God of War.

71
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,600
Instructor Jiang, is there

72
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,800
any level higher than that in the world?

73
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,000
Yes, it does exist.

74
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,190
They are powerful enough to destroy
the universe.

75
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,730
But such a warrior is really rare.

76
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,610
There are only
two or three of them in Huaxia.

77
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:58,760
Ah.

78
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,100
Huaxia, one of the 5 greatest powers,

79
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,300
has only 2 or 3 warriors
beyond the God of War level?

80
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:02,970
Um.

81
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,340
General Instructor Wu.

82
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,400
(Jiang Nian, Director Zhuge arrives.
Come down with Luo Feng.)

83
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,420
On my way.

84
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,450
Luo Feng, follow me.

85
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,333
Luo Feng, I heard from Jiang Nian

86
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,933
that you have mastered
the Five Acupoints Skywards?

87
00:06:23,067 --> 00:06:25,070
Yes, not long ago.

88
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,170
(Who on earth is Director Zhuge?)

89
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,560
(It seems that he is senior to
General Instructor Wu Tong.)

90
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,640
How's your fist power and speed now?

91
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,230
I just tested them today.
My fist power is 3,110 kg.

92
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,070
My speed is 58 meters per second.

93
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,330
Good. I'm here today,

94
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,520
on behalf of the Extreme Martial Club,

95
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,160
to invite you to join us in advance.

96
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,860
Ah, join the
Extreme Martial Club in advance?

97
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,920
But I haven't passed the field test yet.

98
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,110
I've confirmed your ability.

99
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:01,280
You're a talent worthy of our attention.

100
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,640
This is our offer.

101
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,020
Take a look at it, please.

102
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,010
A villa and 20 million Huaxia dollars

103
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,680
Guidance on guiding technique,
sabre skill and body skill,

104
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,680
with a total price of
100 million Huaxia dollars.

105
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,630
One hundred million!

106
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,470
The best offer we ever gave

107
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,850
was guidance on guiding technique
and skills worth 50 million.

108
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,960
But I have faith in you
that I raised it.

109
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,720
Would you accept it?

110
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,390
OK, I'll sign it.

111
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,840
Welcome to the Extreme Martial Club.

112
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,330
You can move into the
villa for warriors today.

113
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,530
Jiang Nian, you'll be in charge.

114
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,230
OK. Director Zhuge.

115
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,700
My name is Zhuge Tao.
I'll see you around.

116
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,680
Instructor Jiang, who is Director Zhuge?

117
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,167
He is one of the three directors

118
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:06,567
of the Jiangnan
Extreme Martial Club headquarter.

119
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,080
Among the Extreme Martial Clubs
of Jiangnan city,

120
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,340
he is only below the president.

121
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,270
And his strength has reached the level
of advanced senior warrior.

122
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,160
Advanced senior warrior!

123
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,960
Alright, let's get moving now.

124
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:30,280
(Huaxia memory.)

125
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,450
(Tencent Video)

126
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,850
I'm not dreaming, am I?

127
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:49,530
Of course not. I've signed a contract
with the Extreme Martial Club.

128
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,410
But you haven't
passed the field test yet.

129
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,000
Luo Feng, let's go.

130
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,267
(Liquor)

131
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,810
I didn't expect to move to the upscale
neighborhood in the downtown area

132
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,130
from the slum district
outside the city.

133
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,800
Here we are.
It's the exclusive villa area

134
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,730
of Extreme Martial Club
of Jiangnan city. Moonlight Villa.

135
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,140
Villa?

136
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:48,110
Mom, dad, I didn't mention it's a villa

137
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,970
because
I was afraid you'd be overexcited.

138
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,780
Kiddo.

139
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,800
Oh, my god, is it true?

140
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,790
This is really...

141
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,930
Yes, from today on,

142
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:30,010
here's our home.

143
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,250
I learned about it before I came.

144
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,260
The first floor is the living room
and the dining room.

145
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,600
The second floor is for bedrooms
and video rooms.

146
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,880
There's an elevator, too.

147
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,630
Hua, you can move freely in this villa.

148
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,320
(It's all worth it)

149
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,320
(since they are all happy.)

150
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,000
(But now,)

151
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,090
(I have to deal with something else.)

152
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,930
=Swallowed Star=

153
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:28,750
I guess you must be Zhou Huayang, right?

154
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,530
Yes, it's me.

155
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,130
Looks like you're well-informed.
You actually found me.

156
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,560
I've been waiting in Nan'an Residence
for a long time.

157
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,890
I followed your car all the way here.

158
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,570
Come on, what do you want me to do?

159
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,470
Bro, I'm sorry.

160
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,020
Why apologize?

161
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:53,450
I did arrange the fight
in the detention house, but Cobra...

162
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,270
I really didn't know Cobra.

163
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,220
It must be Zhang Haobai.

164
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,080
Zhang Haobai?

165
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,940
He has an uncle who's a warrior.

166
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,370
Cobra is a disqualified warrior.

167
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:08,200
Well, he contacted his uncle.

168
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,840
Warrior? Uncle?

169
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:15,870
Brother, please forgive me.

170
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,240
I won't take it.

171
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,240
Bro.

172
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,820
I know what was going on,
and I'll let you go.

173
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,360
I'll get it over with Zhang Haobai.

174
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,600
But I...

175
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,530
This cup of tea is on you. I'll take it.

176
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,540
Now we are even.

177
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,400
I'll deal with Zhang Haobai later.

178
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,300
Tomorrow is the field test
of the warrior.

179
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,750
(Feng, you signed a contract
with the club already.)

180
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,680
(Do you have to take the field test?)

181
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,080
(Yes, I heard that many people
get injured during the test.)

182
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,680
(I did sign the contract,
but if I don't get to be a warrior,)

183
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,680
(I wouldn't be able to use the account.)

184
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:15,160
(Besides, I want to know what I've got.)

185
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,770
It's a great outfit.
It's all made of first-class gold.

186
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,190
It can resist the attacks from
Level-H monsters.

187
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,190
But it's a pity that
it is just lent to us.

188
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:32,200
As long as we become a warrior,
we will get better outfits.

189
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,720
You are Luo Feng?

190
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,720
You are?

191
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,200
Wan Dong from Thunder
and Lightning Martial Club.

192
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,840
What can I do for you?

193
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:42,600
I'm a warrior-to-be,

194
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,067
and I just signed the contract with
Thunder and Lightning Martial Club.

195
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:48,360
Since we both have signed in advance,
do you dare to compete with me?

196
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,360
See who will get a high grade.

197
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:51,790
Not interested.

198
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,810
You!

199
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,560
You want to fight before
the field test starts,

200
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,250
you'll be disqualified right away.

201
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,740
Hey, this kid is so funny.

202
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,010
He's probably too confident.

203
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,830
But you already signed?

204
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,870
I didn't know yet.

205
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,790
Well, I...

206
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,580
Good boy!

207
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,760
Try you best in the field test.
Let me see what you've got.

208
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,380
I'm with Huya Squad.

209
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:32,440
We're going into the wilderness from
the north military area. This is permit.

210
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:36,490
(Temporary pass for Huya Squad)
But this is the place blocked

211
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,000
for the field test.

212
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,620
I have the permit. Are you blind?

213
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,180
Have you got all your fight
suits and outfits?

214
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,920
Now I'll announce the contents
and precautions of the field test.

215
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,050
Last week,
we were attacked by the monsters

216
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:07,080
when sending
important supplies to Hongning.

217
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,910
The convoy was destroyed.

218
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:12,110
It was in the wilderness area known as
the monster town

219
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,110
outside the city of Jiangnan.

220
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,630
Your task

221
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,240
is to go there to collect the supplies

222
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,150
and get DNA samples of the monsters

223
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,510
to develop vaccines.

224
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,950
DNA samples?

225
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,800
A boor like me is not
good at such things.

226
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,570
You don't have to do the research work.

227
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,990
All you have to do
is cut off their ears.

228
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,520
To avoid repeated sampling,

229
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,500
the ears must come from
different monsters.

230
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,150
The number of ears will
determine your grade.

231
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:42,140
Cutting ears? Simple yet rude.

232
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,460
The passing rate of field test is 20%.

233
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:48,700
In other words, 80 out of 100
candidates will be eliminated.

234
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,990
Now get in the car.

235
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,650
We will be monitoring you all the time.

236
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:59,480
If the warriors-to-be attack each other,

237
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,840
we will arrest them on the spot
and permanently disqualify them.

238
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,380
20% pass rate?

239
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,840
It is more difficult than before.

240
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,990
Alright, the field test starts now.

241
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,120
(Different from the virtual combat
of the warrior-to-be,)

242
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,470
(this is a real combat.)

243
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,730
Luo Feng.

244
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,270
I can't believe you survived
the assassination of Cobra.

245
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,430
You were so close to get me in trouble.

246
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:41,160
I'll show you the consequences of
offending a senior warrior.

247
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,390
(The air is filled with smell of blood.)

248
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:19,710
(Looking at the monster closely makes
me feel a strong homicidal intent.)

249
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:24,140
(The field test is indeed different
from the test of warrior-to-be.)

250
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:25,400
(Come on!)

251
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:54,800
(Micro body movement means you
predict rivals' moves by observing,)

252
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,920
(and avoid their attacks
with minimal movements.)

253
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,780
(I understand a bit now.)

254
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,270
(Next goal.)

255
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:26,460
Ah?

256
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,860
(Attacked by other warriors-to-be?)

257
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:43,900
(Warning)

258
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,510
What? Golden eagle?

259
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,680
There are only Level-H to
Level-F monsters there.

260
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,460
How come there's a golden eagle
of Level-D?

261
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,930
Terminate the test now.

262
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,960
No, let it be.

263
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,270

(Based on the novel "Swallowed Star".)

294
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,970
(Next episode)
(As the world's top skill, there are 6 layers.)

295
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,270
(How much do you want?)

296
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,080
(50 million Huaxia dollars.)

297
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,260
(50 million!)

298
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,700
(You're pushing it too far.)

299
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,890
(There are only Level-H to
Level-F monsters there.)

300
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,760
(How come there's a golden eagle?)

301
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,560
(Who is the nearest warrior-to-be?)

302
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,760
(It's Candidate No.93, Luo Feng.)

303
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,740
(Is golden eager invincible?)

304
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,700
(You know assassinating a warrior-to-be
is a very serious crime.)

305
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,190
(You might be dead.)

306
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,320
(I will get rid of him sooner or later.)

307
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,000
(Terminate the test now.)

308
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:39,340
(Swallowed Star Time to Shine
Every Sunday at 10 a.m.)
