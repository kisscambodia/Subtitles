00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,520
(wins the challenge.)

27
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,840
(I suspect that he is the murderer!)

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,010

in the camp)

00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,470

00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,020
(This gravity room is excavated
from the relics)

32
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,410
(of ancient civilization.)

33
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,350
(You are new here, you should seize
the opportunity to strengthen yourself.)

34
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,830
(I've met a lot of guides.)

35
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,630
(Now,)

36
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,840
(is it time for me)

37
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,240
(to protect them instead?)

=Episode 26=

39
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,410
(That monster...)

40
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,050
Wait for me!

41
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,640
(Jiangnan Pavilion)

42
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,230
What happened?

43
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,250
Jiangnan base city is in danger!

44
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,360
No information about the
head of the herd yet.

45
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,290
Chief! There's something wrong with the
frontline team's digital equipment.

46
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,410
They can't detect the head's movements.

47
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,460
What about the casualties?

48
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,920
90% of the Southeast Military Region
who are lower than advanced level

49
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,250
are dead.

50
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,830
Assemble our warriors immediately

51
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,350
to search and intercept in units.

52
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:57,310
Use military satellites
to secure the communication system.

53
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,870
Are there Gods of War from

54
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,100
the local two martial clubs
and HR Alliance coming to help?

55
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,830
Zhou Zhengyong from Extreme Martial Club
is out with Supervisor Liu.

56
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,630
Two Gods of War in Thunder and
Lightning Martial Club are injured.

57
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,290
HR Alliance has ordered to
restrict the warriors.

58
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,690
Now, only the world headquarters

59
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,860
of Extreme Martial Club can help.

60
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,260
Why can't we fight?

61
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,980
We are also from the Jiangnan base city.

62
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,520
It's our duty to fight.

63
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,900
The military speculates that the head of
the herd is as strong as a King Beast.

64
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:27,150
Luo Feng.

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,980
If you meet a King Beast,

66
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,590
you wouldn't even have a chance.

67
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,440
I...

68
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:41,770
Zhao Ruo.

69
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,170
You just got into the top 100
on the black dragon list.

70
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,160
This operation is too dangerous for you.

71
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,000
You two should train hard.

72
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,700
Why don't you stand up for us?

73
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,100
I've got a bad feeling.

74
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,060
Senior, go back.

75
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,400
I need to go to the city.

76
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,300
(Their levels are not high.)

77
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,130
(Where on earth is their head?)

78
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,280
(Domestic departure)
I'm sorry,

79
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,610
but the airport has been requisitioned.

80
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,590
Only people who perform important tasks

81
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,300
in Jiangnan base city can use it.

82
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,970
Is he also going to Jiangnan base city?

83
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:55,930
Yes.

84
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,360
He's with the HR Alliance,

85
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,330
responsible for the transport of
medical supplies for Jiangnan base city.

86
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,470
Hey, sir!

87
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,290
Huh?

88
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,180
Connecting to the real-time monitoring
of camera 3.

89
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:46,880
(Warning)
Where does this

90
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,070
powerful electromagnetic wave come from?

91
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,530
Damn!

92
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,330
The city's protective energy shield

93
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,270
and weapon system
will be temporarily malfunctioned.

94
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,760
Ready for the crash.

95
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,410
(The shock wave comes from
the north of the city.)

96
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,010
(There are stronger mutant
monsters there.)

97
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,670
(Judging from the power of
the shock waves,)

98
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,910
(it's stronger than normal
beast generals.)

99
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,230
(It's an advanced beast general.)

100
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,250
(Or a King Beast!)

101
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,900
(The front line is in urgent need of
ammunition. Need material backup!)

102
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,300
Please come in if you receive it.

103
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,800
(Warning)
Defenses in the southeast

104
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
aren't working!

105
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,480
Contact the Commander
of the Southeast Military Region.

106
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,120
Defend the southeast pass at all costs!

107
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:04,700
Yes!

108
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,180
How is the distribution of supplies?

109
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,720
Non-digital equipment is sent
to the front.

110
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,340
But we're still in urgent need
of medical supplies.

111
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,060
Contact the President of
HR Alliance now!

112
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,040
I'll talk to him in person.

113
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,710
Rest assured.

114
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,240
I'll send someone to take stock
and send it to the front.

115
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,120
You're welcome.

116
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:29,050
It is our duty to provide medical
assistance to the soldiers.

117
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,280
Call the person in charge of
the HR Alliance in Jiangnan Base City.

118
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,460
Listen up.

119
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,300
Be prepared to give up
Jiangnan base city.

120
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,460
HR Alliance has to preserve strength.

121
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,860
Stop sending the medical supplies
to the front.

122
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,340
Bring them all back to headquarters.

123
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,080
I'll talk to

124
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,100
Extreme Martial Club about you.

125
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,160
Emergency notice.

126
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,040
HR Alliance has decided to suspend

127
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,280
(HR Alliance Notice)
all one-way flights

128
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,410
to Jiangnan Base City.

129
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,040
(Do you return to the Departure Point?)
The manned vehicles heading for the city

130
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,060
should return immediately.

131
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,380
Ah.

132
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,110
Please.

133
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,530
Run! Faster!

134
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,360
Go, go!

135
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,030
Hurry! Get into the basement right now!

136
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,430
Hurry, don't get separated.

137
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,610
The soldiers have to die for it.

138
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,240
This is too...

139
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,560
-Commander!
-Yes.

140
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,110
-More monsters are coming!
-Ah!

141
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,200
They are about 3,000 meters away
from the Southeast Military Region.

142
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,780
Contact the North Military Region

143
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,610
and ask them to send 80% military forces

144
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,560
to support us.

145
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,260
Hurry! Support the
Southeast Military Region.

146
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,180
Go, go, go. Ready to go!

147
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:12,860
Ah?

148
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,210
In this way,
there will be no one guarding here.

149
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,140
Don't worry. As long as the war
in the southeast is over...

150
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,800
The monster!

151
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,290
The enemy!

152
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,870
Laser cannon. Target!

153
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,450
Attack!

154
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:26,750
Ah!

155
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,230
(What's going on?)

156
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,840
=Swallowed Star=

157
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,150
The head of the monster was found
in the Northern Military Region?

158
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,740
OK, I'm heading there.

159
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,010
We need people in the north pass.

160
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,300
Thank you for supporting.

161
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,040
It's our duty.

162
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,040
They look one way and row another.

163
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,800
No wonder we couldn't find their head
in the Southeast Military Region.

164
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,760
Their head has got into the city.

165
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,440
We must stop them!

166
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,680
To cooperate with the military,

167
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,430
the martial club has mobilized
special forces to intercept.

168
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,590
But if we confront them in the city,

169
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,810
the power of the Gods of War

170
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,740
might hurt many people.

171
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,450
So, it's best

172
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,890
we draw it out and
encircle and suppress.

173
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,040
OK.

174
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,910
Our target is to draw the head
out of the city.

175
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:36,910
What's that?

176
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,890
(Thank god I landed safely.)

177
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,760
(I need to contact the military
to get the medical supplies.)

178
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,440
What?

179
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,700
Hijacked HR Alliance's airfreighter!

180
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,800
So bold!

181
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,530
I just heard from the pilot.

182
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,710
The warrior is called Luo Feng.

183
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,480
Luo Feng! Again?

184
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:09,780
Luo Feng?

185
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,710
Connecting to the real-time monitoring
of the base city.

186
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,920
Locate Luo Feng.

187
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,930
(Those two look weird.)

188
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,100
(It's like their minds are
being controlled.)

189
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,870
Run! Run! Help!

190
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,640
Run! Hurry!

191
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,460
(That... It's him!)

192
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,180
Mom.

193
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,160
Great.

194
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:57,030
Ah, over there!

195
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,280
Everybody,
go to the underground shelter.

196
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,380
I'll take care of it.

197
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,750
Spirit Master!

198
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,520
It's him!

199
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,850
Let's go there and kill him!

200
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,370
Hump!

201
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:55,380
No.

202
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,180
He is a hero, defending base city now.

203
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,190
Everyone's watching.

204
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,770
If we just kill him,

205
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,770
you and the whole Paulinus clan
will fall into disgrace.

206
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:10,300
But he's the one who killed our son!

207
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,860
I'll make sure he dies.

208
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,020
And no one will find out.

209
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,500
(The place has been evacuated.)

210
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,210
(That's... me in the monster's eye.)

211
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,300
Go.

212
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,340
Fire!

213
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,380
Instructor Jiang, everyone's here.

214
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,340
So, Senator Zhu was right.

215
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,500
You're a Spirit Master.

216
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,660
How did you come?

217
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,640
I flew with HR Alliance's airfreighter.

218
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,710
There are medical supplies
for the military to be received.

219
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,400
The one just crashed?

220
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:41,560
Yes.

221
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,610
Leave it to us.

222
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,280
Cheer up.

223
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,730
Freezing weapons can only
buy us some time.

224
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,020
It won't last long.

225
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,870
This is just the beginning.

226
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:52,810
That monster...

227
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,460
It has spirit energy,
which is very rare in monsters.

228
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,520
It has a snake head and nine bodies.

229
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,510
It's called Nine-headed Snake Dragon.

230
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,420
Looks like the freeze gun
can't restrain it for long.

231
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,210
Shi Jiang, Chu Qiang.
Go and help evacuate the residents.

232
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,860
We'll take care of it here.

233
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,250
Make sure people are safe.

234
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:13,740
OK!

235
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,810
We need to draw it to a place
where there are fewer people,

236
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,110
so we can evacuate the residents.

237
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,670
Let's go to the manufacturing district.

238
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,010
But the infrastructure along the way
would be severely damaged.

239
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,570
We can draw it out of the city.

240
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,250
That's the best.

241
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,740
But it's the hardest.

242
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,240
If we fail,

243
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,390
residential areas along the way
will be affected.

244
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,570
It'll cause casualties.

245
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,170
(This plan is risky,)

246
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:45,290
(but it's a way to minimize the
casualties)

247
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,060
(and protect most of the citizens.)

248
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:49,530
(Besides...)

249
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,480
I suggest we play it safe

250
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,260
and draw it to the manufacturing
district.

251
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:58,650
I'm a Spirit Master.

252
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,040
I won't be affected by the monster.

253
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,330
If I try,

254
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,940
I think I can get it out of the city.

255
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,260
But the monster's spirit energy
is better than yours.

256
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,750
You're good,
but not good enough to defeat it.

257
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,750
Even so,

258
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,380
I might break through.

259
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,780
As long as we draw it out of the city,

260
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,690
we can protect the
infrastructure and people.

261
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,410
Increase the power of the freeze gun!

262
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,610
Now I have to stand up.

263
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,580
We can't gamble on people's lives.

264
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,650
I don't approve of this plan.

265
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,530
The monster is about
to break free from the freeze!

266
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,160
As long as it's in the city,

267
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,720
it will be a threat to the citizens.

268
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,780
The only discipline

269
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,040
is to make decisions
that I won't regret.

270
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,600
Please forgive me.

271
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,320
Luo Feng!

272
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,500
(Chu Qiang, primary God of War.
Senior in Elite Training Camp.)

273
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,500
(He trains hard and ranks the top three
on the black dragon list.)

274
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,360
(He has joined the military and
is determined to defend the base city.)

275
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,520
(Nine-headed Snake Dragon, advanced
beast general. It has spirit energy.)

276
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,520
(As strong as King Beast. Its electrical
superpulse can ruin equipment.)

277
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,410
(It's a great threat to the base city.)

278
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,680
(Its mental attack can disable warriors
lower than God of War.)
