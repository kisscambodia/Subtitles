you've passed this test.)

Feng.

Zhang Haobai,
how dare you hit my father!

35
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,050
You losers. What am I afraid of?

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,510
(Luo Feng.
There are cameras everywhere.)

37
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,980
(If you dare to hit me.
I'll keep you in prison forever.)

38
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,110
Try it.

39
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,100
(What a strength!)

40
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,770
Go!

41
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,400
We got a call about a break-in.

42
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,820
Please come with us
to the police station for questioning.

43
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,310
Mr. Luo, we need to further investigate
the confrontation

44
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,800
in Garden Villa.

45
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,370
During our investigation,
you will be in detention.

46
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,280
Please try to understand.

47
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,610
I'll cooperate as long as
you deal with it fairly.

48
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,840
Good.

49
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,940
Excuse me.

50
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,670
Yes?

51
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,360
Is my father in detention, too?

52
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,270
When will you release Feng?

53
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,810
Mr. Luo Hongguo, we have confirmed

54
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,560
that your colleagues and you
didn't get involved in the fight.

55
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,560
You may leave now.

56
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,700
But your son is still
under investigation.

57
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,530
Impossible. Feng won't fight others
unless it's necessary.

58
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,110
Is there a misunderstanding?

59
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,930
Ms. Gong, please try to understand.

60
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,560
Mom, dad, don't worry.

61
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,840
We know brother well and we believe him.

62
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:28,110
As long as they deal with it fairly,
brother will be alright.

63
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,880
Feng took part in the test of
warrior-to-be today.

64
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,260
Will this detention affect him?

65
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,330
Ah, warrior-to-be?

66
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:50,640
Newbie, come over! Massage me.

67
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,640
I'm sorry but I won't.

68
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,710
Brat, you never heard about me?

69
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,970
Looks like you need a good lesson.

70
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,800
(What? He's strong!)

71
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,830
Brat, forgot to mention

72
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,860
that I've past the test of
warrior-to-be before.

73
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,730
Warrior-to-be?

74
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,710
Hump.

75
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,950
So? Scared?

76
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,040
Warrior-to-be?

77
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:19,930
Looks like
you didn't pass the field test.

78
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,770
What? Are you also...

79
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,240
Ah! Hero! Please show some mercy.

80
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,820
Lad, stop!

81
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,240
If a warrior-to-be causes trouble,

82
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,640
he will be disqualified.

83
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,230
(Hump!)

84
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,230
(That's what Zhang Haobai wants.)

85
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,800
(Tomorrow Bank)

86
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:43,980
Mr. Zhang, what do you mean?

87
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,100
Zhou,
I know there's nothing you can't do

88
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,600
in Yi'an district in Yangzhou.

89
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,180
Actually, I need a favor from you.

90
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:02,090
Oh? You are rich and powerful,
what's troubling you?

91
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,650
A boy named Luo Feng, he pissed me off.

92
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:15,630
Luo Feng? Never heard of him.

93
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,630
He's my classmate.

94
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:21,120
He bit my bodyguard a while back
and dared to hit me.

95
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,640
High school student? If I'm not wrong,

96
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,250
you are a senior student
in the martial club.

97
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,760
How could
a high school student defeat you?

98
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,310
He... is a warrior-to-be.

99
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,810
Well, Mr. Zhang.

100
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,910
We didn't actually meet today.

101
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,160
Adios.

102
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:41,100
Zhou. A warrior-to-be would
scare the hell out of you?

103
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,000
Don't worry.
You don't have to do it yourself.

104
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,280
Mr. Zhang. What does that mean?

105
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,180
Luo Feng is
in the detention house in Yi'an.

106
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,400
I want your men to mess with him there.

107
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,320
Stop kidding. He's a warrior-to-be.

108
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,330
Hump.

109
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,990
Yes, a warrior-to-be.

110
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:06,090
He's already in detention for fighting.

111
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,670
If he causes trouble there,

112
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,740
he will be disqualified.

113
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,520
So what? Even if he's disqualified,

114
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,900
I can't afford to mess with him.

115
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,960
Your men only need to make a mess,

116
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,790
I'll arrange someone
to do the main part.

117
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,080
Someone? Did you

118
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,970
find someone even stronger
than the warrior-to-be?

119
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,800
Cobra, you've got a visitor.

120
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,400
Em?

121
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,630
=Swallowed Star=

122
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,760
OK. Got it.

123
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,880
Haobai. I'll help you.

124
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,160
Sorry, but I have to bail you out
few days later.

125
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,950
I'll transfer you
to the Yi'an detention house first.

126
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,640
Get rid of someone for me.

127
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,880
You know I don't like to take risks.

128
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,770
Here's one million.

129
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,480
I'll recommend you to
join the Huya Squad once it's done.

130
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,400
I'll try to delete the record

131
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,590
of your killing on the field test.

132
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,800
Cobra?

133
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,440
Huya Squad was trying to reach him.

134
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,470
Huya Squad is a senior warrior squad.

135
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,080
Why do they take Cobra so seriously?

136
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,520
Though he was disqualified,

137
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,000
he's so much stronger
than the junior warriors.

138
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,240
In the field test last month,

139
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,420
he himself caused
the greatest number of casualties ever,

140
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,630
though he's in jail.

141
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,150
But the field test
allows casualties.

142
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,360
It's only a matter of time
before he's released.

143
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,420
(If Luo Feng meets
this kind of opponent)

144
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,080
(in the field test, I'm afraid...)

145
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,590
What? Warrior-to-be?

146
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:43,550
Chief. I learned that from his family.

147
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,640
He isn't in the official records yet.

148
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,570
(Today is the day of the test.)

149
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:52,810
(The list of eligible candidates
didn't come out yet, but if...)

150
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,370
Hello, Yi'an detention center.

151
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,400
Hello, are you Chief Dong?

152
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,030
Yes.
(How does she know me?)

153
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,300
I witnessed the fighting
in Garden Villa yesterday.

154
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,880
My surname is Xu.

155
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,450
Xu? Could it be...

156
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,330
(Personal Data File System, Luo Feng.)

157
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,340
The kid's good but inexperienced.

158
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,300
It won't be easy for him
to pass the field test.

159
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:27,630
If he comes across
an opponent like Cobra,

160
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,840
he might be in danger.

161
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,430
We will see if he can grasp
Five Acupoints Skywards.

162
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:36,350
It's the first step to
be a warrior.

163
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,350
He can.

164
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,610
Senator Zhu.

165
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,570
Luo Feng showed great spirituality
in the test earlier.

166
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,750
Five Acupoints Skywards
won't be a problem for him.

167
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,670
Great spirituality?

168
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,540
His spirituality surprised me.

169
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:59,290
Surprised you? You're the Spirit Master.

170
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:07,150
I've heard of an extremely rare group
of warriors with great spirituality.

171
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,320
They are called the Spirit Master.

172
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,120
But I can't find
any information about it.

173
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:18,600
It's normal.
Because there are only few of them.

174
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,010
A Spirit Master is also
an excellent warrior.

175
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,920
They learn the Genetic Energy Practices.

176
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,280
But the difference is they learn
another energy at the same time.

177
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:29,950
(Another energy?)

178
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:30,760
The Spirit Energy.

179
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,280
(It means
under any circumstances)

180
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,710
(a Spirit Master is more powerful
than a normal warrior)

181
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,120
Then, can we practice that, too?

182
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,430
Yes.

183
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:43,440
Unfortunately, as far as I know,
spirituality is a gift.

184
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,840
When you become a real warrior,

185
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,120
you'll have the chance
to learn about it.

186
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,640
For now, just prepare for the field test
next month.

187
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,400
Yes.

188
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:02,140
Palm, sole, head.
Five acupoints are towards the sky.

189
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,670
Is this Five Acupoints Skywards?

190
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,860
What's he doing?

191
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,460
Genetic Energy Practices?

192
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,370
As you know, the warriors
are more powerful and faster,

193
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:23,290
with better physical strength,
defense and mentality.

194
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,810
And these abilities
are from Genetic Energy.

195
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:30,380
During the Great Nirvana,
humans were infected with R.R. virus.

196
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,810
The antibodies optimize our genes.

197
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:36,030
When it reaches a certain point,
we can take energy from the universe.

198
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:40,380
Energy will come into cells, causing an
explosive increase in strength.

199
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,560
That's the genetic energy.

200
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:46,570
Now the warriors have
a rudimentary knowledge to practice it.

201
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:49,240
That is
Five Acupoints Skywards Practices.

202
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,660
It's highly classified.

203
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,960
I will only show you once
on the monitor.

204
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:56,220
There's no copy or file.

205
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,400
You need to remember
in the shortest time possible.

206
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,520
(Five acupoints,
they're in palms, soles)

207
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,830
(and the head.)

208
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:14,990
(Make them skywards and be calm.
So you can feel energy from the universe.)

209
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:21,500
(Anyway,
what is energy from the universe?)

210
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,830
(Can I feel it this way? Or...)

211
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,000
(No. I have to calm myself down.)

212
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:02,040
(Calm down, if I'm easily distracted,)

213
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,710
(how would I defeat
the strong opponents?)

214
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:28,460
(Well,
is this the energy from the universe?)

215
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,870
(That's it!)

216
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,670
(I can feel the energy
flowing into my body)

217
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,860
(and all my cells are getting bigger.)

218
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,160
(No. It's evolving.)

219
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,680
(That's genetic optimization.)

220
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,770

(I'll help you with it.)
