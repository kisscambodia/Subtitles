1
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:09,550
Damn it!

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,880
Did you think you could escape?

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,200
So persistent! Just who the hell are you?

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:17,740
Me?

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,910
I'm just a guy who's a hero for fun.

6
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,660
Haha! And do you still think you look like a hero ?

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,150
You...

8
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,800
You're going to pay me for them.

9
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,310
Do you have all of my money yet?

10
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,480
Not yet...

11
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,250
What will you do? The due date's tomorrow.

12
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,900
You do know what will happen tomorrow if you don't have my money ready,

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,240
right?

14
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,440
Damn it!

15
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,440
I did it again.

One punch

Presented by Harunatsu

20
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,660
Three, two, one, kill shot

21
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:40,410
He joins the fight, he wins, the strongest in history

sanjou, hisshou, shijou saikyou

23
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,410
Are you talking to him? Frustration

24
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,410
nan datten da, frustration

25
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,920

27
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,050
One punch, that's it, one fight after another

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,050
one punch, kanryou, rensenrenshou

29
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,670
He wins, he always wins, overwhelmingly

00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,510

00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,470
On to the very edge

35
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,680
Hero

ore o tataeru koe ya

37
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,850
There are voices praising him

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,900
kassai nante hoshiku wa nai sa

39
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,900
but he's not doing this for acclaim

40
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,150
Hero

41
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:11,900
So he just fight evil without end

Nobody knows who he is

44
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,530
Enemies to fight are numerous as the stars

48
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,950
Hero

49
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,960
He's made up his mind and ain't gonna yield

53
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:40,720

i wanna be a saikyou hero

57
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,880
Could you give me just a little bit more time.

58
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,520
Are you busy ?

59
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,430
Come on in, we're done talking.

60
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,130
See ya, old man.

61
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,130
Tomorrow I'll come for what's mine.

62
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,200
Sorry about that, old man.

63
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,800
Don't worry about it. Probably you don't have any money either.

64
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,760
Sorta...

65
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,620
Lately, there haven't been many clients...

66
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,480
If i don't do anything my arms are going to get flabby.

67
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,460
So, what did you do this time?

68
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,160
Could you have ran into someone strong?

69
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,820
Yeah, he was a little bit stronger. He almost beat me.

70
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,890
I see.

71
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,590
But I can't have this fixed up within today.

72
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,440
So, I'll have to keep it for a bit.

73
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,840
Sure, thanks.

74
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,950
Oh! I almost forgot. I have something to show you.

75
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,740
Since, you're always ripping that suit.

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,640
So, I wanted to make a special one from special material.

77
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,390
Heroes have to transform, you know?

78
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,720
Oh! A superhero suit?

79
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,160
Exactly, a special suit for a super hero.

80
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,930
Shit! i don't want this.

81
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,470
The idea came from the samurai tradition...

82
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,540
He has a name for it too?!

83
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,160
How is it?

84
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,720
How should i put it?...

85
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,110
I see that he included his own tastes...

86
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,660
No, thanks for the offer though.

87
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,570
Don't worry about the money.

88
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,540
This is like a dream for me.

89
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:35,980
Crap,

90
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,160
i don't know what should i say to him?

91
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,640
Could it be that... you already asked a different tailor?

92
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,640
Hmm? Eh, etto...

93
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,790
Then it can't be helped ...

94
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,900
No, it's not that!

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,260
It's just, i thought I would decide on that, after I actually became a real hero.

96
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,480
He's always supported me... Somehow i can't refuse him.

97
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:02,860
Actually,

98
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,500
do you know why I keep wearing the same stuff always ?

99
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,520
It's because I don't want to forget about the important things.

100
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,860
I want to wear that suit, so that I remember where I came from.

101
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,930
I see, so that's how it is.

102
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,010
Alright, now the next!

103
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:27,360
On top of that, it's too early to call me Montsuki Hakama.

104
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,040
I see...

105
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,530
When I'm a professional hero, I'll ask you for it myself.

106
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:39,800
You're right... Right now, you only do this for a hobby.

107
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,610
Anyway, I'll come back tomorrow.

108
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,460
See you.

109
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,810
Ah, one more thing!

110
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,970
I know you do this for a hobby, but maybe drop the role of hero for a little.

111
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,080
Lately things around here haven't been peaceful at all.

112
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,370
Really ?

113
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,600
Just look at those stores.

114
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,420
There are many shops , but inside there's nothing .

115
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,030
This place isn't enough to live in.

116
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,250
He told me he still doesn't have the money.

117
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,840
I see...

118
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,070
In that case, that store will be mine.

119
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:19,450
But boss, why do you want that store?

120
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,600
Even if you had it, you wouldn't get any customers.

121
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,210
I know quite that well,

122
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,600
but my goal isn't to get money.

123
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,860
The impulse...

124
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,370
There's a force within me that tells me to destroy everything.

125
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:43,710
Boss, I got the papers for the candy shop.

126
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,720
Nice, good work.

127
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,150
I feel good.

128
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,060
It's close...

129
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,160
Just a little more...

130
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,490
What the old man said was true.

131
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,290
Lots of stores have closed recently.

132
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,120
And now that I think about it, the crimes in this area are really frequent.

133
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,640
There was one in the street,

134
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,300
in a house,

135
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,850
and that store earlier today.

136
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,320
In just one week I captured three delinquents...

137
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,950
Is this zone really no longer safe?

138
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,710
This is the rhinoceros beetle.

139
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,200
Wow, it's already completely a beetle, professor!

140
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,420
I told you it would transform as soon as it was born. Ah, it's like that!

141
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,120
Oh, is that so?

142
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:41,980
I didn't knew about that.

143
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,690
Who is it at this hour?

144
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,370
What a bother...

145
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,080
Do you have the rent?

146
00:07:55,230 --> 00:08:00,190
You, haven't payed rent in three months, you know that?

147
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,000
Uh... you see the thing is,

148
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,380
i don't have the money and I'm busy...

149
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:11,420
Ha! I don't know if you're a hero or what, but I'm sure there's a way you can make money with that.

150
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,200
Don't say that.

151
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,280
If you don't pay,

152
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,930
I'll kick you out. Know that.

153
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,880
Yeah...

154
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,240
You're strong, why don't you work?

155
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,360
I know that too, but...

156
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,780
Don't beat yourself up. After all, its cheap, right?

157
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,880
Here. It's done.

158
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,200
Oh, thanks!

159
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,820
Although, in that suit you look more like a tramp than a superhero.

160
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,300
Be more careful,

161
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,370
soon I'm not going to be able to fix it for you.

162
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,940
Today's the day, old man.

163
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,810
Alright, I'll take this as payment.

164
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,810
See ya!

165
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,810
Who was that guy?

166
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,960
The store will have to close.

167
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,920
They're taking everything soon.

168
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,580
They're from the Niya Niya Loans group,

169
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,600
, for sometime they've been taking money to insure the shop.

170
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:25,320
I can't pay the fees and interest anymore.

171
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,600
So... you were cheated?

172
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,960
Either way,

173
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,400
the shop closes today.

174
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,260
Why don't you ask the police for help?

175
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,390
I can't do that.

176
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,840
They live in that apartment,

177
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,540
where even the police can't interfere.

178
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,280
Surely you've heard of it.

179
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,960
I haven't, what is it?

180
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,660
Huh? You really don't know?

181
00:09:52,450 --> 00:10:01,370
Go straight ahead, leave the main street and you'll see a sign that says "Stop, Danger."

182
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:07,210
When you get to that street and walk a bit you'll see a supermarket. Get it?

183
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,210
Yeah.

184
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,790
The place is on the narrow street alongside that supermarket.

185
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,640
There,

186
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,060
No matter what happens , don't go near that apartment.

187
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,000
That apartment is the base of those thugs,

188
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,110
the house of crime...

189
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,030
Just as i thought, this is the place where i live.

190
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,400
No wonder, why the rent is so low.

191
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,350
You do know what will happen , if you don't give it back.

192
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:42,350
Hey! Do you know where is Niya Niya Loan located ?

193
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,200
Huh, need a loan?

194
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,720
No, it's not for that. I have business with them.

195
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,320
Then look for it yourself. I'm busy right now, asshole!

196
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,700
Presented by Harunatsu

197
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,990
Presented by Harunatsu

198
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,240
I wonder if this is the room...

199
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,600
Who is it?

200
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,440
Did you come to pay the rent?

201
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,260
That was close...

202
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,440
I had no idea who was living in that room!

203
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,880
Niya Niya Loan, you said?

204
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,400
Yeah, I heard they operate out of these apartment.

205
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,630
Well, not out of this room.

206
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,860
Hey, you!

207
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:44,170
Be careful which room you visit,

208
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:50,000
in this apartment not everyone is as nice as me.

209
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:52,440
Oh, I see...

210
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,960
It's probably better if I check the other side.

211
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,400
No one's home.

212
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,400
Wait.

213
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,520
Who are you?

214
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,320
I'm a tenant here.

215
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,080
Tenant? Of this apartment?

216
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,460
Yeah. I live on the other side,

217
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,460
I'm a hero as a hobby.

218
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,560
Is that so? Good luck with that.

219
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,530
Wait, did you say hero?

220
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:30,960
It can't be, brother! I think he realized that we're counterfeiting!

221
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,210
I see...

222
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:38,540
Bastard, you want to beat us for the reward!

223
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,530
Reward?

224
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,890
I don't know if you're a hero or what,

225
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:49,180
but I'm sure there's a way you can make money with that.

226
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,280
I see.

227
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,110
So there's a reward!

228
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,460
No doubt about it, I can see it in his face that he wants to catch us.

229
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,460
Fine...

230
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,310
Try it, if you can!

231
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,800
Huh? That guy...

232
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,630
What?

233
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,670
That guy,

234
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:38,090
is kind of giving me the creeps.

235
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,210
I've gotta warn the boss!

236
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,130
Oh, its you.

237
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:51,130
Who is that guy? Police?

238
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,440
No, but he beat up a bunch of our guys!

239
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,190
What did you say?

240
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,980
I think he's arrived.

241
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,080
Is it you?

242
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,780
The dangerous guy that we're looking for...

243
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:14,620
You... You're dressed really weird.

244
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,520
Are you really the boss of all these guys?

245
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,760
And what do you mean by that?

246
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,720
This is about "Gofukuya".

247
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,330
I've come to ask that you return the store papers to its owner.

248
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,660
There's gonna be trouble if there's nobody to fix my clothes.

249
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,480
Don't fuck with me!

250
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,120
Do you really think it'll be that easy?

251
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,860
I see that you're pretty confident in your strength.

252
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,790
But do you think that'll solve everything?

253
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,190
There's no need for that sort of thing.

254
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:42,540
What do you mean by that ?

255
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,990
I see, I pretty much get it.

256
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,120
I'll go and solve this misunderstanding.

257
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,600
Hey, did you hear what I said?

258
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,170
Yeah. That's why I said I'll bring back your papers.

259
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,840
And if you close the shop , then who will fix my clothes?

260
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:06,000
Hey, that's not why I brought it up.

261
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,130
It's fine,

262
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,150
I know what I'm doing.

263
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,250
Look at this.

264
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,060
Listen.

265
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,100
If we're talking about the percentage dictated by the law, "Gufukuya's" debt is already canceled.

266
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:27,840
When it surpasses a certain percentage,

267
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:32,640
that's called overpaying.

268
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:39,630
Besides, there's no basis in the law that says you can just take his store.

269
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,110
So please, give back the papers.

270
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:53,630
You beat up all my men to tell me this shit?

271
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,430
Huh? Oh, no that was just an accident.

272
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,920
Interesting...

273
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,440
not bad... not bad at all!

274
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,740
I have a bad feeling about this...

275
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,230
I knew I should have stopped him.

276
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,760
They're not the kind of people who will understand those kind of things, you know!

277
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,760
Don't worry, I'll clear things up quickly.

278
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,610
And what if something happens to you? I couldn't forgive myself.

279
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,110
Like I said, I'll resolve this quickly.

280
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,520
Don't worry. I do it for a hobby, but I'll keep being a hero.

281
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,430
See ya!

282
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,160
Don't get too excited.

283
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,040
Didn't you realize?

284
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:10,800
People like me, who take evil to a whole new level, we transform into monsters.

285
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:16,090
Finally, the moment has come!

286
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,940
Are you speechless from fear?

287
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,750
I see. This is the first time I've seen it.

288
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,390
I'm a monster "the Fish of Darkness"!

289
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,390
No, you're not  "the Fish of Darkness".

290
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:32,800
You're just a pervert .

291
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,380
I learned yesterday.

292
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:45,710
The caterpillar that comes out of the egg becomes a pupa until adulthood. We call this...

293
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,640
Did you say... pervert ?

294
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,430
Yes, speaking scientifically.

295
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,780
Me? The Fish of Darkness??

296
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,790
But you were already a strange one.

297
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,000
In this case, when a pervert gets even more perverted,

298
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,980
you just become a perverted pervert, a true pervert.

299
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,160
A true pervert?

300
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,980
Yep, a total pervert.

301
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,790
Don't fuck with me-gyu!

302
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,320
I'm not just any villain!

303
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,830
Not bad!

304
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,060
Same to you.

305
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,110
I think I've reached my limit.

306
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:38,320
It's not for nothing that the reward for capturing me is the highest.

307
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,310
Reward?

308
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,750
What's with that look ?

309
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,600
Did you come to pay the rent?

310
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,650
I don't have money, but I can give you this.

311
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,320
Money laundering, underwear theft, and counterfeiting.

312
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,130
They all have bounties, right?

313
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,000
I called the police, if we give them all of these together,

314
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,160
there'll definitely be enough to pay the rent, right?

315
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,490
You, you've done something really bad...

316
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,360
my main source of income.

317
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:24,240
If I wanted this bullshit, I'd have asked for it!

318
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,480
That old lady,

319
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,220
really kicked me out...

320
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,250
I'm glad you're well, Saitama-kun.

321
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,860
I see, I'm sorry.

322
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,020
I didn't like that place anyway.

323
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,790
I only liked the rent.

324
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,040
What will you do now ?

325
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,480
Well, for starters I have to find a new place to stay.

326
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,730
It's something you talked about,

327
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:07,690
but... Lots of things have been through that shop, and I had to deal with them all,

328
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,950
but now I think it's time to change.

329
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,560
Be more innovate and may be some other stuffs, you know.

330
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:18,960
I see.

331
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,510
That's a good thing.

332
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,940
Saitama-kun!

333
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:26,190
Thank you for protecting the store.

334
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,000
Yeah, you can count on me.

335
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,000
I'm still closing the store.

336
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,800
I've been thinking,

337
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,160
i'm too old for this.

338
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:39,610
I see.

339
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,770
I guess, it can't be helped.

340
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,720
I know it won't change much,

341
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:51,400
but of course You don't have to wear it if you don't want to, but I want you to have it.

342
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,960
This...

343
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:57,290
I finally can feel satisfied with my work.

344
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,410
Now that I think about it,

345
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,280
I was looking for a reason to retire anyway.

346
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,040
This is my final achievement.

347
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,740
It's everything I have.

348
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:21,100
I can already see a real hero in you.

349
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:25,360
You inspired me to make this suit.

350
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:36,060
Won't they think I'm a bit strange?...

351
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,970
And that was how it came to be.

352
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:46,360
For a while I was embarrassed to wear it, so I wore my tracksuit over it, but eventually I got used to it.

353
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,570
but eventually I got used to it.

354
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,540
Anyway, it's something important to me.

355
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,760
I see!

356
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:04,590
So, in order to become a true hero,

357
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:11,020
you need to have something very important to you, like you do.

358
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,150
What?

359
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,150
Master,

360
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,510
I think its about time you change suits.

361
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,350
It's okay, I'd like to give it to you as a gift...

362
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:28,570
I don't want it! Seriously, were you even listening to that whole story?

363
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:37,900
nee hayaku kaette kite ne

364
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:37,900
Hey, come back home soon

365
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:51,120
tameiki ga mikazuki wo yurasu yoru wa

366
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:51,120
On nights when the new moon shivers from my sighs

367
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:57,270
I close my eyes and think of you

368
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:57,270
me wo tojite kimi no koto kangaete bakari

369

370
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,290
I want to see you... I feel like crying

371
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:02,830
I feel so romantic

372
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:02,830

373
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:09,360

374
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:09,360
I hope these feelings reach you

375
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:18,100
datte zutto shitteiru no

376
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:18,100
I know very well

377
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:23,350
how hard you work all the time

378
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:23,350
ganbatteru koto takusan

379
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:28,010
You're the one I love

380
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:28,010

381

382
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:31,150
You're so strong but I'm still worried

383
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:37,110
watashi ni dake wa yowasa misete

384
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:37,110
Don't hide your weakness, at least show it to me

385
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:43,160
I'll find you before any stars

386
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:43,160
hoshi yori saki ni mitsukete ageru
