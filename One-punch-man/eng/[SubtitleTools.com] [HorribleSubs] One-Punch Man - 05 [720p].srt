1
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,360
CITY A - HERO ASSOCIATION HQ

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,030
Then it is decided that Mumen Rider
CITY A - HERO ASSOCIATION HQ

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,240
will remain the top-ranked
class C hero.

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,370
Understood. I will let him know.

5
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:18,990
I simply cannot understand

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,120
why he has no desire
to move up to class B...

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:28,920
Our next agenda item is
the 55th Hero Certification Exam.

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,510
For this exam,
the total number of candidates is...

9
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:36,050
11,684, with the exam offered
at six different venues.

10
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,680
That is an increase of more than
22% over the previous exam.

11
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,190
We mustn't be happy
with simple quantity.

12
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,400
Even with more candidates,

13
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,940
if the quality of the heroes
is reduced,

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,820
the numbers are meaningless.

15
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,030
Therefore, we ought to be even more
critical during evaluations.

16
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,080
Also, I hear that
a certain person of interest

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,540
is taking the exam this time.

18
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,000
Yes, it hasn't been confirmed yet,

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
but it seems very likely
that he will.

20
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:52,100
HERO TEST LOCATION #6

21
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:57,280
Candidates, please form
two lines for registration.

22
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,720
Next!
Side-to-side jumps for 30 seconds!

23
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,220
Ready...

24
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:26,890
Go!

25
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,020
Next, the 1500-meter run. Go!

26
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,200
Next, weightlifting!

27
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,200
Next, shot put!

28
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,080
Vertical jumping!

29
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,880
Whack-a-Mole!

30
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,800
Punching machine!

31
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,010
I'm going home...

32
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:10,640
THE ULTIMATE MASTER

33
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,230
Finally done with all the tests.

34
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,820
Now I just wait for the results.

35
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,990
Oh, you done, too?

36
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,530
Yes.

37
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,740
Hey, is there a point in you
taking fitness tests?

38
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:29,910
Huh?

39
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,830
I mean, can't you just give them
the data on your specs?

40
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,500
Well, whatever. So how was it?

41
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,920
Both the written and fitness tests
were far too simple.

42
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,550
Right? Is that really all there is
to becoming a hero?

43
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,760
We should get our results soon.

44
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,890
70 points is a passing grade.

45
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,600
The written test was so easy
anyone could get full points on it.

46
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,860
That just leaves the fitness test,

47
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,230
which for us should not have
posed any problems.

48
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,240
ONE HOUR LATER

49
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,030
I got 100 points.

50
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,530
Seriously?

51
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,610
Yes.

52
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,950
It says I'm certified as
a class S hero.

53
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,040
Class S? What's that?

54
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,880
I am sure these rankings
mean little.

55
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,460
How did you do, Master?

56
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,800
Huh?

57
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,880
Oh! The letter says I'm also...

58
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,090
Class S.

59
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,800
I am not surprised.

60
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,850
On top of that, the font size
is bigger than mine.

61
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,890
I expected nothing less, Master.

62
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,020
By the way, what did they
ask you at the interview?

63
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:40,730
Interview?

64
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,980
Yes.

65
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,650
Just one final question, Genos.

66
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,620
Does this building
look familiar to you?

67
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,910
We've been secretly investigating
a group of troublemakers

68
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,370
that call themselves
the "House of Evolution."

69
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,170
Just when we identified
its center of operations,

70
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,920
we found the building had been
mysteriously destroyed.

71
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,840
And with overwhelmingly
intense firepower.

72
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,600
Are you responsible for this?

73
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,430
I am.

74
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:16,770
Why?

75
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,440
CERTIFIED S CLASS

76
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
I see...

77
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,950
I suppose it must be that

78
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,200
they felt no need to go through
the trouble of interviewing you.

79
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:34,910
Master?

80
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,460
Yeah, after all...

81
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,670
I'm just a class C hero
with a score of 71 points.

82
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,050
I see.

83
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,510
So I mistakenly thought the top half
of the "C" was part an "S."

84
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,180
Stop analyzing it!

85
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,890
It must be a mistake.

86
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,140
I will talk to
the person in charge.

87
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,770
No, don't!
You'll just embarrass me!

88
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,850
Mr. Genos, Mr. Saitama,

89
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,070
there will be a seminar for
successful candidates at 4:00 PM.

90
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,190
Please come to lecture hall #3.

91
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,700
All right, come on.

92
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,450
All that really matters
is we passed.

93
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,740
Let's get it over with and go home.

94
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,910
We finally found the cyborg
we've been looking for.

95
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,000
So I've heard.

96
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,500
In consideration of
his past accomplishments,

97
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,800
we made an exception and
certified him as a Class S hero.

98
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:33,390
I just wanted to make sure
you were notified of this.

99
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,850
Yes, I approve.

100
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,350
Genos, huh?

101
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,190
LECTURE HALL #3

102
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,900
First, congratulations on passing.

103
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,570
Now one of you
only made it on a fluke,

104
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,990
so unless you want your luck
to go to waste,

105
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,450
I better see you
giving it your all.

106
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,460
And don't get all puffed up!

107
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:08,710
From here on, keep your hero status
in mind and act modestly!

108
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,970
After all, your faces will be placed
on the Hero Association website.

109
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,100
Did you hear me?

110
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:21,680
That goofball head of yours is
gonna be shown to the whole world.

111
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,890
If you don't want to
humiliate yourselves...

112
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,900
Aspire to be a fine hero like me!

113
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,990
Master!

114
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:45,460
As a class A hero, I have some
influence over the Association.

115
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,500
I'll make sure those who
behave irresponsibly...

116
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,000
lose points and get demoted.

117
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,630
Don't you forget it!

118
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,630
What should I have for dinner?

119
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,100
Apparently, the Hero Association
was formed about three years ago.

120
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,690
So it's only been three years?

121
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,940
It was after the grandchild of
a millionaire called Agoni

122
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,610
was attacked by a monster.

123
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,400
The child was saved by a passerby.

124
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,900
When Agoni heard
what had happened,

125
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,950
he came up with this system
and used his fortune

126
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,030
to establish the Hero Association.

127
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,080
Well, they put on
some pretty boring seminars.

128
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:28,380
In any case, as new heroes,
we'll be known around the world.

129
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,920
Now we can work with
our heads held high.

130
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,260
Master...

131
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,760
I guess I'm now officially
your disciple.

132
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,310
Please continue to guide me
as my mentor.

133
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,060
Yeah...

134
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,230
All right, Master. Good night.

135
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,610
Yeah, see you.

136
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,860
Crap...

137
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,490
Maybe I shouldn't have been so quick
to say I'd take a disciple.

138
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,990
Especially this guy...

139
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,910
Those two newcomers today--
did they really pass the exam?

140
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,040
Their attitudes were awful!

141
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,500
I'm Class A, rank 38 damn it,
and they had no idea who I was.

142
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,340
Plus they don't know the first thing
about how the world works.

143
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,880
Damn amateurs!

144
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,930
They'll be dirt-napping in no time.

145
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,010
No.

146
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,520
Genos got perfect scores on both
the written and physical exams.

147
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,140
He's a phenomenal rookie

148
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,350
who gained a class S ranking
right off the bat.

149
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:34,940
The other one, Saitama,
had terrible scores on the essay,

150
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,190
but scored a perfect 50
on the physical.

151
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,280
That's how he was able to
pass at all.

152
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,280
But in practically every activity
on the fitness exam,

153
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:48,210
he broke the Hero Association's test
records by inconceivable margins.

154
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,920
It's as if there's a god
residing in that body.

155
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:01,930
Snek, you've already been
outranked by Genos.

156
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,510
And Saitama may catch up
with you soon enough.

157
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,850
That jackass?

158
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,940
If I get to the top of class C,
then I'll get promoted to class B...

159
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:21,360
And class A is above that,
with class S even above that...

160
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,530
I guess Genos is
actually pretty amazing.

161
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,870
I don't know...

162
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,040
...but maybe this isn't
the kind of hero I wanted to be.

163
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,300
The newcomer seminar
isn't over yet!

164
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,550
In this business, there's a thing
called rookie crushing.

165
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,890
A lot of us heroes
hate to be outranked.

166
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,940
So we crush newbies early on...
like this!

167
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,430
Hero Registry?

168
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:34,900
Yes, I am a class S hero and you
are a class C hero.

169
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,770
We are both ranked last
in our classes.

170
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,190
Right now, we are still listed
as Genos and Saitama,

171
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:45,240
but as we perform more heroic acts,
we will acquire hero names.

172
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,990
Hero names? What are those?

173
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:53,460
I believe they are like nicknames
that capture a hero's characteristics.

174
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,290
For example,
I might be the "Blond Cyborg."

175
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,050
Wait, if that's how it works,
won't I be like the "Caped Baldy?"

176
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,090
Aside from being ranked by ability,

177
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,340
you can also be
ranked by popularity.

178
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,720
There are some heroes
that have fan clubs.

179
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,100
Well, no one cares about that.

180
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,430
Wha--?!

181
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:17,600
Thank you for agreeing to
my unreasonable request today.

182
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,980
Yeah, well I did promise
to make you my disciple...

183
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,030
Is right here good?

184
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,110
Yes...

185
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,110
So we're just having
a practice bout, right?

186
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,200
Not fighting for real?

187
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,330
Yes, that's what I have in mind.

188
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:36,960
But I want you to go all out,
so I too will give it my all.

189
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,090
Please grant my request.

190
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,170
That was close...

191
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,550
My clothes could have got
burnt up again.

192
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,260
I need more speed!

193
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,080
He's gone?

194
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,870
Have I been chasing
his afterimage this whole time?

195
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,050
There!

196
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:14,930
Incinerate!

197
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:18,980
I got him this time.

198
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,520
Master will have to take me
more seriously now...

199
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,060
Behind--

200
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,070
Okay, I win.

201
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,070
Master...

202
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:31,990
Yah?

203
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,120
Have you forgotten
the rules of the bout?

204
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,160
Dodge any attack
you are able to dodge.

205
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,620
Take it seriously
and no fooling around.

206
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,960
Do not hold back.

207
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,880
And...

208
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,090
keep fighting until
I am no longer able to fight.

209
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,720
Even Master Saitama himself
cannot explain.

210
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,680
The secret to his power...

211
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,470
This fight may give me
some insight into it.

212
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,350
Show me no mercy.

213
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,030
Those were the rules, Master--

214
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,030
What the--?!

215
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,740
DEATH

216
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,130
I'm starving. Time for lunch.

217
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,920
Let's grab some udon noodles.

218
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,220
Okay...

219
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:43,060
I am prepared to do anything
in order to become stronger.

220
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:44,640
But...

221
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,570
I can't picture myself
even approaching Master's power.

222
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,110
Not at all...

223
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,700
He's on a different level.

224
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,750
What's the matter?
You don't like udon?

225
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:12,050
I see, that's his location?
Thanks, I'll head there now.

226
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,630
No, don't worry.

227
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,890
I'm just going to let him know
what the industry expects of him.

228
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,810
I'm glad you like udon.

229
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,020
Yes, I'm not very picky.

230
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,230
Well, I'm also kinda
low on funds right now...

231
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,860
Hey, how about
another match, Genos?

232
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:39,870
SUPER-SPICY MEGA-MONSTER
UDON CHALLENGE
PRIZE: Y=50,000
FAILURE: Y=10,000

233
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,910
That's insane!

234
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,990
No way!

235
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,080
I give up...

236
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,050
Is that it?

237
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,970
Man, you're awesome!

238
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:02,890
Welcome?!

239
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,150
You must be Genos.

240
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,980
I'm Amai Mask, class A rank 1.

241
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,070
I'd like to talk to you.

242
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,490
Class A, rank 1?

243
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,990
It's Amai Mask!

244
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,530
He's so gorgeous!

245
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,580
Talk?

246
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,250
He might be a rookie crusher...

247
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,160
Be careful, Genos!

248
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:31,040
I see. Please wait here, Master.

249
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:32,880
Very well.

250
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,010
I was just thinking about taking
a walk to digest my food.

251
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,510
I hear you were certified class S
by special exception.

252
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,680
What of it?

253
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,070
I wonder if he's all right...

254
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,330
Done already?

255
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,290
Yes.

256
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,200
You really are class S.

257
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:12,000
To have the top-ranked class A hero
come to personally crush you...

258
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,790
That's not it.

259
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,550
So he wasn't here to fight?
Then what gives?

260
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,170
In short...

261
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,470
He came to welcome me.

262
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,930
Huh? What's that mean?

263
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,430
Excuse me!

264
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,520
You're friends with
Amai Mask, right?

265
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,480
May I shake your hand?

266
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:35,940
Thank you very much!

267
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,940
Shake mine too!

268
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,030
Class S and class C heroes
sure get treated differently.

269
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,250
If you think about it, though,
isn't that like fraud money?

270
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,460
WELCOME GIFT
I mean, you're a cyborg, right?

271
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,830
WELCOME GIFT
Yes...

272
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,210
Never mind. In any case, now we're
even with a win and a loss apiece.

273
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,130
Starting today
we're professional heroes.

274
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,010
Let's do our best, okay?

275
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,220
Yes.

276
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:12,140
A professional hero must always be
a beautiful symbol of justice.

277
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,150
That is my philosophy.

278
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,320
It's especially true
if you're a class S hero.

279
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,990
Come on,
there's no need to glare at me.

280
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,030
I came all the way here
just to see you.

281
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,120
How was the Certification Exam?

282
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,750
It was nothing but rubbish.
An exam like that is a waste of time.

283
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:38,420
If you came to fight, get on with it.
This, too, is a waste of time.

284
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,180
Being hot-blooded is fine,
but if you take it too far...

285
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,680
...you'll get burnt.

286
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,390
I'll forget your criticism
of the Association.

287
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,310
Thank you for your time.

288
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,820
I welcome you to the team.

289
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:00,940
We expect great things
from you...

290
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,150
Genos.

291
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,460
Master...

292
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,170
I will be back later.

293
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,680
Oh, okay...

294
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,220
I'll see you.

295
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,930
Yes, goodbye.

296
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,880
A waste of time?

297
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:04,130
Such an interesting fellow...

298
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,180
Uh...

299
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,850
So when you said,
"I'll be back..."

300
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,810
This is what you meant?

301
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:47,650
Yes. I went home
to gather my things.

302
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,110
May I live here?

303
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,530
Absolutely not.

304
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,120
I have rent money.

305
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,420
Did you bring a toothbrush?

306
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,120
Yes!

307
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,130
NEXT EPISODE:
THE TERRIFYING CITY

308

NEXT EPISODE:
THE TERRIFYING CITY

309
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:12,090
A lot of guys think
my name is "Snake,"
NEXT EPISODE:

310
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,680
but it's Snek, so don't forget it!

"The Terrifying City."
NEXT EPISODE:
THE TERRIFYING CITY

313
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,310
There's time left?
Well, I'm fully aware of that.
NEXT EPISODE:
THE TERRIFYING CITY

314
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,980
That's right! In this industry,
NEXT EPISODE:
THE TERRIFYING CITY

315
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,400
there's such a thing as killing time
