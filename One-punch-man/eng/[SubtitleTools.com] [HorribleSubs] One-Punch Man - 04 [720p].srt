1
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,610
Why are we forced to work?!

2
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,990
Why must we pay money
in order to eat?!

3
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,990
Can't we all just share?

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,870
The rich get fat

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,490
while the poor die!

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,500
Where is the true freedom
in this world?!

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,460
We are all slaves to our work!

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,710
And is work fun?

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,090
No! How could it be?!

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,840
We do not want to work, period!

11
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:35,380
That's why I, Hammerhead,
will change our society

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,800
into one where only those
who want to work will work,

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,010
while the rest are supported!

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,430
We will create a utopia!

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,150
The Paradisers led by me, Hammerhead,
will make all this a reality!

16
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,320
Boss, no one's listening.

17
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,200
What?!

18
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,530
Bah! These civilians are idiots!

19
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,030
Let's go!

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,790
Zeniru's the richest man in town.

21
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,830
We'll wreck his posh penthouse
and show them we're serious!

22
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,790
High-rise apartments
are symbols of inequality!

23
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,000
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

24
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,430
This whole building is Zeniru's home.

25
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,940
There's no way he made
so much money legally.

26
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,900
Unforgivable! Bring it down!

27
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,190
Yes, sir!

28
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,870
Target destroyed!

29
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:15,170
Hm, these experimental battle suits
sure pack a wallop.

30
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:19,590
It was definitely worth risking
our lives to steal them.

31
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,760
Wait, that was the wrong building.

32
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,600
My bad, Boss.

33
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,600
Zeniru's house is a little further up.

34
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,310
Everyone makes mistakes!

35
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,900
The important thing is to learn
from them. Am I right?

36
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,110
Yes, you're right!

37
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,940
All right, then onward to Zeniru's!

38
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,290
Thanks, bicycle guy!

39
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:20,030
Don't come asking to play rock, scissors,
paper with a booger on your finger!

40
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,740
A dream?

41
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,080
The terrorist group responsible
for the riots

42
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,290
call themselves the Paradisers.

43
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,210
They have destroyed
a high-rise building in City F.

44
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,040
The situation seems to
be spiraling out of control.

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,960
We have just learned
the identity of their leader.

46
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,590
B-CLASS CRIMINAL - HAMMERHEAD
Hammerhead is a B-class criminal

47
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,300
B-CLASS CRIMINAL - HAMMERHEAD
who has been involved in several

48
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,930
B-CLASS CRIMINAL - HAMMERHEAD
violent incidents in the past.

49
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,510
He is a man of large stature,

50
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,270
standing 2.15m tall
and weighing 210kg.

51
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,850
According to one report,

52
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,100
he once fought 20 men
in a street brawl

53
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,560
and sent them all to the hospital.

54
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,360
The Paradisers sent the following
message to this TV station.

55
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,700
"We will continue to riot until food,
clothing and shelter

56
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,910
"are provided free of charge
to those who do not work,"

57
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,740
- Sounds pretty boring.
- amongst other unintelligible demands.

58
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,830
Like Hammerhead, the group is
made up of unemployed young men

59
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,920
- No need for me to get involved.
- with no motivation to work.

60
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,050
Also, the group members
all have shaven heads,

61
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:24,010
making them quite intimidating.

62
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,680
Those who encounter
any shaven-headed men on the street

63
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,800
are advised to leave
the area immediately.

64
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,770
What?

65
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,140
But that's--

66
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,060
They stole

67
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,640
my look!

68
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,230
I spend all this time trying
to be a hero,

69
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,690
but if they keep acting up
I'll be treated

70
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,860
like a villain!

71
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,490
I'm gonna smash them!

72
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,740
Run!

73
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,570
It's them!

74
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,200
The Paradisers are coming.

75
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,330
They aren't...

76
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,950
backing down!

77
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,830
This is too dangerous!

78
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,590
Stop right there, you pack of thugs!

79
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,400
The bicyclist for justice,
Mumen Rider, is here!

80
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,440
Mumen Rider has come to save us!

81
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,320
There's nothing to fear if he's here!

82
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,360
A hero? What a joke!

83
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,900
Here I go!

84
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,530
Somebody call an ambulance!

85
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,660
Mr. Zeniru, you must flee!

86
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,080
H-Hm. But running away
from terrorists

87
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,960
would hurt my reputation.

88
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,840
There's no need to leave.

89
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,970
You're a lucky man,

90
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,930
having this occur
while I'm still under contract.

91
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,560
But you're a bodyguard--

92
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,930
Oh, Sonic!

93
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,350
Can I leave this to you?

94
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
The men coming are--

95
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,900
Of course.

96
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,860
It's their lives you should worry about.

97
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,360
But please do think of a way to
dispose of the pile of dead bodies.

98
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:14,950
The Paradisers...

99
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,250
A bunch of upstarts equipped with
some new type of battle suit.

100
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,620
And B-class criminal Hammerhead.

101
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,040
He might have some backbone.

102
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,880
THE MODERN NINJA

103
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:36,350
Boss, you can see Zeniru's building
across the woods.

104
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,390
People call it the Golden Turd.

105
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,020
All right, let's go!

106
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,530
Something's here.

107
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,700
I've been waiting
for you, Hammerhead.

108
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,370
Zeniru sent me.

109
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,250
Let me start out by saying

110
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,590
no opponent of mine has
ever escaped alive.

111
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,590
I plan on keeping it that way.

112
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,050
When it comes to my job,
I'm a perfectionist.

113
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,390
But if you surrender right now,

114
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,100
I'll let you live.

115
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,020
So, what will it be?

116
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,340
What is this?

117
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,930
What's going on?

118
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,140
Why is every--

119
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,890
Nooo!

120
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,940
Bastard!

121
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,070
What's this now?
Trying to intimidate me?

122
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,830
You can't see me, can you?

123
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,000
There you are!

124
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,420
It's a terrorist!

125
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,880
No, I'm not!

126
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,600
So he decided to fight
instead of run.

127
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,900
Oops, there goes
my bad habit again.

128
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,030
You're just a little dog bought
by Zeniru's money.

129
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,450
You think someone like me,
who fights for a noble cause,

130
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,870
can lose to a dog?!

131
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,580
Yes, I see what he's up to.

132
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,080
Just as I thought--
he's a complete fool.

133
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,870
Couldn't he have at least

134
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,880
tried to arrange the rocks
in a less obvious way?

135
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,010
There are plenty more rocks
where those came from!

136
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:19,930
If you don't stop me,
they'll keep coming.

137
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,850
So you think you'll be able
to deal with my speed

138
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,640
if you know which direction
I'm coming from?

139
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,480
How pathetic.
But I'll play along.

140
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:29,900
In fact,

141
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,940
I'll take you...

142
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,190
straight on!

143
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,780
He's too fast. I can't see him.

144
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,580
But it doesn't matter if I can't.

145
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,080
Because of this!

146
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,370
Gotcha!

147
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,210
Think about how stupid
you were to face off against me

148
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,210
on your way down to Hell!

149
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,010
It's over.

150
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,600
Unfortunately,
I couldn't go easy on them.

151
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,350
Yes, Hammerhead's body is here too.

152
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,270
I'll head back now--

153
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,940
The body disappeared?

154
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,610
That was close!

155
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,990
Good thing he hit my head.

156
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,830
My skull always was several times
thicker than normal.

157
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,040
Dammit. I don't know
who that bastard was,

158
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,290
but one day I'm gonna kill--

159
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,170
Huh?

160
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,080
Now what?

161
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:40,840
Hm?

162
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,890
Oh, there you are.

163
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,610
As with the mosquito monster,

164
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:03,410
I once again underestimated
my opponent's power.

165
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,740
I let my guard down and Kabuto
took advantage of that.

166
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,580
If Master Saitama had not been there,

167
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,870
I would certainly have been destroyed.

168
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,670
I see.

169
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,500
Well, I'm glad you're okay--

170
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,500
Doctor...

171
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:21,840
Master Saitama
saved my life twice.

172
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,140
You, Doctor Kuseno,
restored my life to me.

173
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,050
Later this same life was saved
by Master Saitama,

174
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,140
who now has saved it again.

175
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,980
Yes, I get the picture, Genos.

176
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,350
What you're trying to tell me is

177
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,230
how amazing
this Saitama fellow is, right?

178
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,440
Yes.

179
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,030
Genos, they're not ready just yet,

180
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,910
but I am developing
a new series of augmentations.

181
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,040
When I replace your existing parts
with these new ones,

182
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,330
you may be able to
surpass this Saitama.

183
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,670
I imagine he must possess
an enormous amount of strength

184
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,290
for you go on about him so.

185
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,420
Yes.

186
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,760
What's your deal?

187
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,890
You here to sign up
with the Paradisers?

188
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,050
No, no.

189
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,810
I'm just a guy who's a hero for fun.

190
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,060
For personal reasons,
I'm here to smash your heads in.

191
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,980
So, where are your followers?

192
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,150
Then, die!!

193
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,320
I better get out of here quick.

194
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,450
Huh?!

195
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,000
I thought I punched him?

196
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,620
What a letdown.

197
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,000
I was all excited
about these battle suits.

198
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,960
But the design is lame,

199
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,010
and all they do is give you
superhuman strength.

200
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,430
You have no idea how hard it was

201
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,760
to get hold of these things!

202
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:55,180
How could you know their value?!

203
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:03,690
I've been looking for someone to
test the full power of this suit on!

204
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,410
Spin attack!

205
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,370
I used to use that move
all the time when I was a kid...

206
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,090
Huh?

207
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,630
No way...

208
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,390
Hammerhead, huh?
He's a lot like me.

209
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,760
What the hell are you?!

210
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:46,990
W-Wait. I just wanted
to get out of working...

211
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,870
Don't be bad anymore, okay?

212
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,910
Huh? So you're
not going to kill me?

213
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,750
- Get outta here.
- Okay!

214
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,590
Guess I'll go home.

215
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,090
Where did Hammerhead go?

216
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,930
There's no one left but you.

217
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,980
Hammerhead went that way.
Buck naked.

218
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,990
What's this?

219
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,540
Hey, you got it wrong.

220
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,540
I got what wrong?

221
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,920
I'm not one of the Paradisers.

222
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,170
You're lying.

223
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,800
No, no, no.
Don't be dumb--look at me!

224
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,140
I don't need to.

225
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,850
With that bald head,
there's no denying it.

226
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:58,850
No.

227
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,430
Look! It's me. Me!

228
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,810
You know, the guy who's a hero for fun--

229
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,060
Never heard of you.

230
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,900
Oh, I see...

231
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,860
Either way, it doesn't matter.

232
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:18,280
You read my attacks. Twice.
That's the real problem.

233
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,000
Born in a ninja village,

234
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,420
I've been perfecting
my techniques since childhood.

235
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,960
Yet you saw right through them.
This I cannot allow.

236
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,680
What's he talking about?

237
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,010
My pride won't have it.

238
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:41,430
I don't care who you are,
I can't let you simply walk away.

239
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,480
Oh, come on.

240
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:47,560
You just want to try out
your moves on me.

241
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,360
I can tell by that innocent smile
of yours.

242
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:02,660
What do you think of this speed
that beats sound?

243
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,620
Of these shock waves?

244
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,750
Can you even see me?

245
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,300
How can you possibly
keep up with me?

246
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,600
Can I go home?

247
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,140
Bastard!

248
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,930
Wind Blade Kick!

249
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,270
Checkmate.

250
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,070
Sorry!

251
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,740
That wasn't on purpose.

252
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,240
I meant to stop
before hitting you,

253
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,990
but your momentum carried
my fist into your...

254
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,750
WE ARE EXPERIENCING
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES.
PLEASE STAND BY.

255
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:51,590
I've worked every job from
assassin to bodyguard.

256
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,000
No ninja is more deadly.

257
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,800
I am Speed-o'-Sound Sonic!

258
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,180
But I'm putting my work on hold.

259
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,930
Now that I've found such
a formidable opponent,

260
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:02,350
I'm dedicating myself to training
until we settle this.

261
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,730
Let me know your name.

262
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
It's Saitama.

263
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,440
Saitama!

264
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,020
Next time we meet,
it'll be your demise!

265
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,150
Okay.

266
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,240
I, Speed-o'-Sound Sonic,
the ultimate ninja,

267
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,370
will bring you down without fail!

268
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,330
Train hard!

269
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,910
Speed-o'-Sound Sonic?

270
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,330
Who is that?

271
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,250
And who would possess such
a redundant name?

272
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,420
Dunno.

273
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:34,670
He suddenly appeared,

274
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,760
declared we were rivals,
and took off.

275
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,630
If he is a nuisance,
I will get rid of him.

276
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,140
Well, you're hardly different.

277
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,510
Actually, why are you here again?

278
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,270
Go home.
It's not like we're related.

279
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,600
Master, I must become stronger--

280
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,980
Shut up!

281
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,940
I'm now aware of a serious problem
and am reeling from shock.

282
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,900
So I beg you, go home for today.

283
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,240
A serious problem?

284
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:03,280
What could cause a problem
for someone as great as you?

285
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,830
Please share with me.

286
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:13,960
No one knows who I am.

287
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,260
It's been three years since
I first became a hero.

288
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:25,350
I've defeated many monsters and
evil organizations during that time.

289
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:29,980
I've never heard of any other heroes
doing as much as me.

290
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,060
Everyone in the world should
know me by now!

291
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:37,280
Isn't it weird that I don't have
any fans or anything?!

292
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,900
You know what he said to me today?

293
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,530
"Never heard of you."

294
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:47,950
Plus, everyone in town took me
for a terrorist.

295
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:51,710
They've all forgotten how
I beat those monsters for them!

296
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,540
He is right.

297
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,960
The news report did not mention

298
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,130
Master Saitama or Speed-o'-Sound Sonic.

299
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,630
Instead, the credit
for defeating the Paradisers

300
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,510
went to a hero called Mumen Rider.

301
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,260
Wait...

302
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,850
Master!

303
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,890
Are you listed with the Hero Registry?

304
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,060

318

I had no idea.

319
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,140
Genos, are you registered?

320
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,440
No. I feel no need to.

321
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,530
Let's register! Register with me
and I'll make you my disciple.

322

Let's go.

323
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:11,910
P-Please... F-Forgive me...

324
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:18,040
Pleading for his life after stealing
battle suits from the organization?

325
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,000
He truly understood nothing.

326
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,170
Of course,
we did let the theft take place

327
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,510
in order to collect data from
the suits in the field.

328
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,260
And the body?

329
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,550
Leave it.

330
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,730
Thanks for giving me
my thick skull...

331
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,890
Mommy.

332
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,480
I promise I'll get a job!

333
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,730
APPLICATION FOR HERO TEST
Our guest today is Mr. Majimeda,

334
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,030
APPLICATION FOR HERO TEST
an expert on the labor issues
confronting young people today.

335
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:44,940
Thank you for having me.

336
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,860
As we saw with
the Paradiser incident recently,

337
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,120
there's an increase in young people
who lack all motivation to work.

338
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,700
can you comment on this phenomenon?

339
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,910
-I'm not so different...
-Even in the case of the Paradisers,

340
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,540
I think they've been influenced
by irresponsible lyrics

341
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,830
in popular songs like
"Don't Give Up on Your Dreams"

342
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,920
and "Make Your Dreams Come True."

343
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,010
- ...from those unemployed guys.
- People who believe such hogwash

344
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:10,850
end up making excuses for themselves
and become discouraged.

345
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:14,020
One wrong step
and I could've been one of them.

346
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,620
Ready to go, Master?

347
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,080
Y-Yeah.

348
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:05,040
HERO TEST LOCATION #6

349
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:09,090

THE ULTIMATE MENTOR
Err... I'm the recently reformed
Hammerhead.

350
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,800
NEXT EPISODE:
THE ULTIMATE MENTOR
Before I introduce next week's episode,

351
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,930
NEXT EPISODE:
THE ULTIMATE MENTOR
I'd like to do a little PR for myself.

352
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,760
Oh? You won't allow that?

353
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,890
Next time on One-Punch Man:
Episode 5, "The Ultimate Mentor."

354
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:24,100
Yeah, if I'd had a mentor like him,
maybe my life would've been different.
