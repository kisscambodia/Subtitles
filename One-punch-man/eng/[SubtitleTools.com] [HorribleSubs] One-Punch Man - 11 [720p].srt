1
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,100
Th-This can't be happening!

2
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,940
Even Groribas, our best warrior, defeated?!

3
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,990
What manner of creature is he?
And how'd he get aboard?

4
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,200
Damn it!

5
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,200
Melzargard was supposed
to be guarding the ship!

6
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:03,290
Now he and I are
the only elite fighters left!

7
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,620
I bet he's just mucking about…

8
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,290
I need him now!

9
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:09,090
Curse the bastard!

10
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,130
Geryuganshoop,
what is the problem?

11
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,920
Lord Boros!
I-I'm terribly sorry.

12
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,430
I've allowed one of the natives
to infiltrate the ship.

13
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,010
In the mere four minutes
since coming aboard,

14
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,100
he has damaged 23%
of the ship.

15
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,230
It seems he is alone,

16
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,980
but he has managed
to instantly kill

17
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,230
every warrior sent to
intercept him.

18
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:31,770
Do not panic.

19
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,900
As long as the power sphere
is safe,

20
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,070
the ship will not go down.

21
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,530
The damage so far is limited to
the crew's living quarters.

22
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,830
But minnows won't be enough.

23
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,660
Geryuganshoop…

24
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,380
you, Groribas and Melzargard,
my top lieutenants,

25
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,340
will go eliminate this intruder.

26
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,260
Groribas has fallen, sir…

27
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,340
What?

28
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,550
Let me get Melzargard
back here!

29
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,680
He and I together will wipe out
the intruder without fail!

30
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,450
THE DOMINATOR OF THE UNIVERSE

31
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,090
MYSTERY CRAFT IN SKIES ABOVE CITY A
We have more information on
the enormous flying object

32
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:08,010
MYSTERY CRAFT IN SKIES ABOVE CITY A
that suddenly appeared
in the skies over City A.

33
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,350
I'm here at the scene.

34
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:15,100
As you can see, all the main roads
leading to City A have been closed,

35
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,400
and officials
are on high alert.

36
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,900
According to survivors,

37
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,780
City A has been almost
entirely demolished.

38
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,080
EMPLOYMENT APPLICATION
NAME: HAMMERHEAD

39
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:37,580
This image of the giant flying object
was captured with a telephoto lens.

40
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,800
What are your thoughts?

41
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,880
Most likely, this is the act of an alien
or extraterrestrial being.

42
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,140
Or perhaps
it's an unidentified life-form

43
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,810
that has a highly advanced civilization
unbeknownst to us.

44
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,730
Of course, other possibilities
exist as well.

45
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,230
I see.

46
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,900
Also, there have been
eyewitness accounts of

47
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,730
very powerful life-forms

48
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,990
descending to the ground
from the spacecraft.

49
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:09,530
Several Class S heroes are presently
at the location tackling the issue.

50
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,840
He pummeled that thing with
nothing but his bare fists.

51
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,510
That's a Class S for you.

52
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,100
But even so…

53
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,690
It's no good!

54
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,860
It possesses incredible
regenerative powers.

55
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,650
And don't let it hit any part of you.

56
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,570
A single blow instantly
tore my arm off.

57
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,370
Dodge its attacks at all costs!

58
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,160
If I may cut in…

59
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,970
Shall we use a bombardment
to finish them off?

60
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,340
That is good.

61
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,300
Contact the ship.

62
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,600
I will go.

63
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,770
Get back here!

64
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:20,850
You scum!

65
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,940
Best mind your manners!

66
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,690
I hope ya like mincemeat, freak!

67
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,070
Melzargard! What are you doing?!

68
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,030
I'm in battle.

69
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,280
We have an intruder!

70
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:34,990
Ridiculous.

71
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,120
It's true. Finish them off
and get up here!

72
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,340
This one's locked too…

73
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,760
Hey, open up!
You've got a visitor!

74
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,850
Oops… I broke it.

75
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,940
I've decided.

76
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,030
I'm going to rip your limbs off,

77
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,820
then keep you as
the ship mascot.

78
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,280
That is good.

79
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,990
Put yourself together again, eh?

80
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm gonna keep you
for batting practice!

81
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,650
Comrades! It may be that
direct physical attacks

82
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,860
have no effect on it!

83
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,230
Let's withdraw for now…

84
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,900
and think of a way to destroy it,
like heat or something!

85
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:56,160
Smashing is all I can do! Forget it!

86
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,990
This is all I know, too.

87
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,120
Can't teach an old dog new tricks.

88
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,920
Me, too. Sorry, sweet Iairon!

89
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,090
Iai, don't you have faith in me?

90
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,220
There's nothing I can't cut down.

91
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,090
It's pointless…

92
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:19,970
These guys aren't the type to listen.

93
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:25,810
Melzargard!

94
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,070
Look, I really need you
on the ship.

95
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,230
Getting rid of the intruder
takes priority.

96
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:35,070
I'd love to, but I'm busy.
These creatures are persistent.

97
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,660
What the hell?

98
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,870
The life forms down there are proving
tough to handle too?

99
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:43,040
Nothing tough about them.

100
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,960
What's with the ship?
Is it going down?

101
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,040
It's not going down,

102
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,090
but more than half the crew
have been killed.

103
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,220
What?!

104
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,560
Listen. Begin cleansing my location

105
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,520
with a bombardment from the ship!

106
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,600
I've got my hands full right now.

107
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,650
Besides, artillery bombardment is
the job of the lower ranks.

108
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,020
Well, I'm in a situation where
I can't return to the ship.

109
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,570
All right.

110
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,240
I'll notify the artillery crews.

111
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,990
Don't get caught up in
the barrage and die.

112
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,410
Hey, wait!

113
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,040
You should come down here
and help me.

114
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,710
That'd be much faster.

115
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,880
Oi! Geryuganshoop!

116
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,420
Damn him. How tough is this intruder?

117
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,850
How about another one?!

118
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,100
More futile attacks.

119
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,400
Although you are exhausting
yourself. That is good.

120
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:52,820
The hell is this?

121
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,320
A marble? Why've you got this?

122
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,040
Give it back!

123
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,540
Sure thing.

124
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,830
Damn!

125
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,500
That's nasty, ya nasty bastard!
You dead?

126
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,260
Hey, this guy's got marble-looking
things inside him.

127
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,180
That's where ya hurt him!

128
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:24,890
Oh!

129
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,140
Nice work.

130
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,360
So I just have to keep slicing
until I hit a vital marble!

131
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,940
Impossible!

132
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,160
I've been growing that head
for a hundred years!

133
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,070
It died in a dump like this?

134
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:47,040
But you scum are all dead
when the shells hit.

135
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,000
They're on their way!

136
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,050
Attention, intruder!

137
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,130
Stop your destructive acts
and leave this instant.

138
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,300
Attention, intruder!

139
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,140
Leave immediately.

140
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,230
Otherwise, we will unleash
all our forces against you!

141
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,520
That's weird.

142
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,940
I hear a voice right
inside my head.

143
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,360
Take one more step…

144
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,190
…and you're dead!

145
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,650
Even if I wanted to get out,

146
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,990
I can't. I've lost my way!

147
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,490
Really? You'll leave?

148
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,490
All right, I will guide you.

149
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,120
Take a right, then go
up the stairs there.

150
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,960
A right?

151
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,830
Exactly, a right.

152
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,000
I guess I'll go left!

153
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,090
No, wait! Not that way!

154
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,890
W-W-Wait…
Hang on! You can't…!

155
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,050
All right, that was my fault!

156
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:49,390
I'll come to you.
Please stay right there.

157
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,390
Ahhh! Noooo!

158
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,230
Now this place looks like
a control room or something.

159
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,820
You…

160
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,280
An octopus?

161
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,160
You dare go around
busting up our ship?

162
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,420
Hey! The debris is all flying at me!

163
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:23,590
Now Geryuganshoop, the supreme
telekinetic power in the universe,

164
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,510
will grind you
into blood sausage.

165
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,870
Just about there.

166
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,840
Lord Geryuganshoop, preparations
for the bombardment

167
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,960
are nearly complete.

168
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,550
Shall I proceed?

169
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:07,390
Maybe he went to the bathroom…

170
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,100
Hey, Lord Geryuganshoop!

171
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,690
Telekinetic power…like a psychic?

172
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,980
You leave me no choice.

173
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,070
Super Telekinetic Gravitational Wave!

174
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,110
Die, Earthling!

175
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:34,080
My unparalleled telekinetic
powers allow me

176
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,170
to manipulate even
the forces of gravity!

177
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,880
Have you any idea
what a black hole is, you ape?

178
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,050
Inside one, the gravitational effects
are so strong

179
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,970
even light itself cannot escape!

180
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,760
Wait…?

181
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,020
Now what?

182
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,440
Take this!
Telekinetic Shower of Rubble!

183
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,830
I got him!

184
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,380
What a waste of psychic powers.

185
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,710
I mean, all you're doing
is tossing pebbles around.

186
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,170
Anyone can do that.

187
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,550
How...could...

188
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,970
I…Geryuganshoop…

189
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,180
be...

190
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,020
Excuse me—

191
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,020
Can I ask…

192
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,610
…where your boss is?

193
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,490
This looks bad.

194
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,040
Is that confirmed?

195
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,750
Yes, Child Emperor said that
the energy level in

196
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,920
the spaceship is rapidly rising.

197
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,250
Yes, but the civilians—

198
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,010
Recall the search and
rescue teams for now.

199
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,640
Have everyone take cover.

200
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,550
You'll be taking fire soon!

201
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,940
Hop on!

202
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:32,950
There we go.

203
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,990
Geryuganshoop still hasn't
gotten back to me…

204
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,950
but whatever.

205
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,790
Let's see…

206
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,960
I believe the order was
to concentrate fire

207
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,920
around the enemies on
the surface near Melzargard.

208
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,090
Two heads to go!

209
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,140
I'll bust 'em wide open!

210
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,720
Is it time?

211
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,180
Ship, bombardment, coming…

212
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,060
There they are.

213
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,560
All right…

214
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,480
click!

215
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,150
It's over.

216
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,030
Evasion, impossible.
Instant death.

217
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,840
Huh… What happened?

218
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,090
What on earth?

219
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,590
They stopped.

220
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,970
All of you would
be dead without me.

221
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,100
Can't you even finish
one small fry?

222
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,140
Maybe try starting over
from Class C.

223
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,070
You can have…

224
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,780
your shells back.

225
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,450
Th-This is…

226
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,960
I wanna go home.

227
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:19,180
I didn’t expect you to be here.

228
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,810
Thank you, Mumen Rider.

229
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,230
Which areas are likely
to have survivors?

230
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,600
There must be more out there.

231
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,190
But you…

232
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,110
I'll go rescue them right now.

233
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,070
We want to know, too.

234
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,200
Yeah, can't let him hog the limelight.

235
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,120
Stinger, Lightning Max…

236
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,080
Mind if we borrow this?

237
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,080
You guys…

238
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,010
Nice catch.

239
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,520
Found it…

240
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:11,650
Smush.

241
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,110
One left!

242
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,120
Silverfang!

243
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,620
A…direct hit.

244
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,630
Weak, weak!

245
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,260
You are all so very weak.

246
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,090
Dead after a single hit!

247
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,390
A change of tactics
was all I needed.

248
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,310
If I forget defense and
focus on attack,

249
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,270
this will all be over quickly.

250
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,100
And you're next!

251
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:56,400
I will spring past that sword and
squeeze your skull 'til it pops.

252
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,990
Think so? Then be my guest.

253
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,710
So he's come.

254
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,200
This planet's finest warrior…

255
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,200
I can sense no limit to his energy.

256
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,290
You the boss of these invaders?

257
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,830
Wonderful!

258
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,340
Before we fight,
let us exchange names.

259
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,550
I lead the pirate band known
as Dark Matter,

260
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,640
and am Dominator of the Universe.
I am Boros.

261
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,940
I'm a hero for fu—I mean,

262
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,520
a professional hero.

263
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,190
My name's Saitama.

264
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:16,940
Saitama…

265
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,530
Look, I don't know what
the Denominator of the Universe

266
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,150
wants with Earth…

267
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:24,410
…but you sure trashed City A.

268
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,580
What I want with Earth?

269
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,330
There exists a prophecy.

270
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,750
Prophecy? You mean…

271
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,880
Once, I traveled the universe,
ravaging everything in sight.

272
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,590
But I was too strong.

273
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:47,930
Eventually, there were none left
who could face me.

274
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,060
I came to know the torment of utter,
all-encompassing boredom.

275
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:56,480
Then one day, a seer told me…

276
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,070
On a faraway planet,

277
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,110
a being exists who is my match,

278
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,610
one who could rekindle
my passion for battle.

279
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,740
That was nearly twenty years ago.

280
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:10,870
Have you any idea the distance
I have traveled to get here?

281
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:15,500
My men thought the prophecy
was a ruse,

282
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,210
made up to lure me away…

283
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,880
But now I am certain.

284
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,550
Come. Give stimulation
to my existence.

285
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,590
That is why I am here!

286
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,180
Are you stupid?

287
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,350
You can't just go around
attacking other planets

288
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,020
just to liven up your boring life.

289
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,060
Even telemarketers wouldn't think that.

290
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,750
This set of armor, used to seal
in my immeasurable, irresistible power…

291
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,670
…has been broken.

292
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,340
OK.

293
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:32,830
It is time!

294
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,130
THE STRONGEST HERO

295
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:12,380
THE STRONGEST HERO
The next…and final episode of
One-Punch Man is…

296
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,550
"The Strongest Hero."

297
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,510
What does it mean to be "strongest,"

298
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,850
Saitama?

299
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,310
You must tell me too…
