00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,480
THE OBSESSIVE SCIENTIST

2
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,490
Long ago, there existed
a brilliant young scientist.

3
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,330
By dint of his astonishing genius,

4
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,960
he was able to make a number of
contributions to human knowledge.

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:33,260
Eventually, however, he became
disillusioned with the world.

6
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,020
Though constantly showered with praise
for the subtlety of his mind,

7
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,060
none of his ideas or theories
ever received

8
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,190
even the slightest support
from the scientific community.

9
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,150
"We should not be striving to advance
human civilization,

10
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,490
but rather the artificial evolution of
humans as a species."

11
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,450
That was the only dream
he had ever had,

12
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,080
but not a single person came forward
to help him fulfill that dream.

13
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,870
Damn these apes!

14
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,170
"Dangerous ideas?"
Writing about me as if I were some freak?

15
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:16,010
Do they really think humans have come
this far by avoiding risks?

16
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:20,970
Idiots who think
they no longer need to evolve

17
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,970
have no right to pass on their genes!

18
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,980
Of course, this plan was always
for my own sake.

19
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,190
I will carry it out...
even if I must do it all myself!

20
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,700
Thereafter, he devoted himself to research.

21
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:42,080
It was only after he turned 70
that his efforts began to yield results.

22
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,670
First, the scientist regained his youth.

23
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,380
Next, he began cloning himself.

24
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,390
He named his laboratory
the "House of Evolution,"

25
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,720
and together with his clones

26
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,350
he conducted countless experiments
with animals to create new species.

27
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,400
Eventually, his experiments shifted to
human subjects--

28
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,110
This is taking too long!

29
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:14,940
...Huh?

30
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:18,990
What's this got to do with me?
You're just trying to act cool again.

31
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,490
Just get to the point, okay?

32
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:28,540
My master is a busy man.
Summarize it in 20 words or less.

33
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,250
...I-I'm sorry.

34
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:11,600
So, in other words, my boss has become
very curious about your body.

35
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,770
I'm not interested in dudes.

36
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,810
I think you misunderstood, Master.

37
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,110
He plans to use your body,
which surpasses normal human limitations,

38
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:24,150
for his research on evolution.

39
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,080
If we don't do something,
I'm sure he'll try again.

40
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,580
We cannot allow him a free hand.

41
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,120
Our move should be to attack him.

42
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,840
Sure, let's go.

43
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,040
Okay.

44
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,090
Huh?

45
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,090
Now?!

46
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:47,090
Yeah, there's a sale on tomorrow.
Can't do it then.

47
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,550
Master!

48
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,220
This doesn't sound good.
Better tell the Doctor....

49
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,060
Hey, you.

50
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,140
Oh. Yes?

51
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,690
I have one last question.

52
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:01,730
Was the "House of Evolution" developing
cyborgs prior to four years ago?

53
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,940
How many more cyborgs are there?

54
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,820
Have any of them destroyed towns
in the past?

55
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,120
I'm not sure,

56
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,080
but at the "House of Evolution,"
I'm the only combat cyborg.

57
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,120
Impossible!

58
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,630
Our elite force, formed for the extermination
of these obsolete humans, wiped out?!

59
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,340
According to Armored Gorilla's report,
the two responsible are on their way here.

60
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,430
If they come,

61
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,020
all our research, everything we've been
working on, could be destroyed.

62
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,060
This is a serious matter.

63
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,270
The only option is to use our trump card.

64
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,110
Begin preparations for the release of
Carnage Kabuto.

65
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,030
What?!

66
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,080
-No, not him!
-That's crazy!

67
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,870
-He'll finally be released?
-He's right. That might be the only way.

68
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,330
-But maybe we should stop him.
-It's too dangerous.

69
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,670
-I have a bad feeling about this.
-Is that the only way?

70
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,920
Be calm!
He will be our last resort.

71
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,170
But...

72
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,430
First, from the first to the eighth floor,
we'll activate all our traps.

73
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,100
If we're lucky, they will take care of
the intruders.

74
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,970
I'm fully aware of what will happen to me

75
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,180
should we fail.

76
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,650
I didn't think we'd be running
the whole way.

77
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,020
How else are we gonna get there?

78
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,740
I was sure you could fly or something.

79
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,280
Humans can't fly, you know.

80
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,080
It's amazing that you are never late.
You are a true hero.

81
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,120
Actually, I hardly ever arrive on time.

82
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,830
We're here.

83
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,130
This is the place Gorilla told us of.

84
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,920
So this is...

85
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,130
...the "House of Evolution."

86
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:54,510
One, two, three, four, five, six...
Looks like it's about eight stories high--

87
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:09,780
Uh...what was that all of a sudden?

88
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:16,490
Yes. I decided it would be most efficient
to destroy them all in one swoop.

89
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,080
Well, that's true but...

90
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,120
We could have at least seen
what the bad guys had in store for us.

91
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,170
That was kind of mean.

92
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,050
Looks like there's a basement.

93
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,650
S-Stop!!

94
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,670
Hey, Carnage Kabuto.

95
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,880
Are you well?

96
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:12,420
It appears you've killed
a bunch of my clones again.

97
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,050
Satisfied?

98
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,090
Huh?

99
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:21,060
Fool! Why would I be satisfied?

100
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,980
I've been kept locked up
deep beneath the Earth.

101
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:30,820
Me! The strongest warrior in the entire
"House of Evolution."

102
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:36,910
You are mentally unstable. We couldn't
control you. There was no choice.

103
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:42,200
Control? You moron!

104
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,960
I am the culmination of the "New Human"
you guys have sought for so long.

105
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,800
My intelligence and physical strength
and your own are incomparable!

106
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,180
You should be the ones obeying me.

107
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,930
No. You're a failure.

108
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:04,060
It's true you perform
at unheard of levels,

109
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,100
but it is humanity you lack.

110
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,480
Go ahead, kill me.
Plenty of clones could take my place.

111
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,610
Oh?

112
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,320
But I have a favor to ask first.

113
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,610
There's a specimen I must have.

114
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,790
He is extremely strong.
Only you can defeat him.

115
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,250
I want you to catch him for me...

116
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,800
...dead or alive.

117
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,130
This basement is huge!

118
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,050
I'm getting kind of fired up.

119
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,010
Huh?

120
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,850
I sense living beings deeper in...

121
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,270
Master, two of them are approaching.

122
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,480
Oh, here we go!

123
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,110
There are two. Which one is it?

124
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,490
The one on the right...

125
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,700
In that case, you don't need the one
on the left!

126
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,580
Genos?

127
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,960
Huh?

128
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,210
Hey...

129
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,880
I am Carnage Kabuto!

130
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,090
We got a combat experimentation room.

131
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:20,050
Let's do this in there.

132
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,680
You turned Genos into a piece of
modern art.

133
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,770
Fight's on!

134
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,240
Pretty big, eh?

135
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,030
It's the biggest room in the facility.

136
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:45,950
This is where they make us fight
to test our combat abilities.

137
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,080
Well then, let's start the killing--

138
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,920
Oh?

139
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,300
Still alive, huh?

140
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,070
You fool!

141
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,530
Machinegun Blows!

142
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,340
He got me.

143
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,050
Let me...

144
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,380
...take him...

145
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,100
Your face is all cracked.
Don't push yourself.

146
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,730
With his breath? Impossible!

147
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,650
Genos, you okay?

148
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,570
Yes...

149
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,330
No you're not! Look at your head!

150
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:19,130
You've gone and gotten my hopes up.

151
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:44,070
I have always been critical of humans
and their inferior abilities.

152
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:49,740
The entire species, aside from myself,
can be viewed only as dumb animals.

153
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,450
That realization was agony for me.

154
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,330
If memory serves, I was 15
when it occurred to me.

155
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,880
A plan to evolve
the human animal

156
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,920
and create a world
where I could live contentedly.

157
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:08,050
A utopia of my own, created by me.

158
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,180
A world made up of only us,

159
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,640
the new human breed
that will transcend humanity!

160
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,200
I must see it through.

161
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:32,120
Compared to my anguish back then,
this physical pain I feel now is nothing.

162
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,620
What's the hold up? Let's go!

163
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,540
Bring everything you've got.

164
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,170
Carnage Kabuto--a demon incarnate,

165
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,050
the strongest and most brutal
creation of the House of Evolution.

166
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,970
Let's see how you, at your archaic stage
of human development,

167
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,930
fare against a monster that is
the final form of artificial evolution.

168
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:56,270
Or will you be the trigger for
a new evolution?

169
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,730
I can't wait to find out!

170
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,780
Oh, I see it. I see it!
You're supposed to be strong.

171
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,280
Don't disappoint me now.

172
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,080
You're this place's ultimate weapon, right?

173
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,790
You're clearly not the same as the guys
from this morning.

174
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,080
Look at you, just oozing with confidence.

175
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,170
Such speed!

176
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,140
What are you doing?

177
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:37,930
Hey.

178
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,150
He just backed off?

179
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,610
Carnage Kabuto?!

180
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,490
If I'd attacked him just now,
he'd have killed me.

181
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,530
Who the hell is this guy?

182
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,490
He's leaving himself wide open,

183
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:58,790
yet all my instincts are screaming,
sending out danger signals!

184
00:14:59,160 --> 00:14:59,750
Huh?

185
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,080
You bastard!

186
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:07,840
How the hell did you get that strong?!

187
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,930
So you wanna know too?

188
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,560
Okay, fine.

189
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,730
Genos, you listen carefully too.

190
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,190
He's going to tell us right now?

191
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,490
The secret to Master's power...?

192
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,780
I'd like to know too.

193
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,700
Huh?

194
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,740
Who are you?

195
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,240
I am Genus.

196
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,500
Well, fine. Listen up.

197
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,170
It's too risky! He can't let these guys
know his secret!

198
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:55,760
First, what's important is, to make sure
you stick to this intense training regimen.

199
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:01,560
Training? Not modification surgery
or genetic enhancement,

200
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,060
but training?

201
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,190
What training...?

202
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,400
Listen, Genos.

203
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,110
You just have to keep doing it.

204
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,490
No matter how hard it gets.

205
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,790
It took me three years to get this strong.

206
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:25,960
One hundred push-ups!
One hundred sit-ups!

207
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,840
One hundred squats!

208
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,050
Then a ten kilometer run.

209
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,170
Every single day!

210
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,230
And of course, make sure you eat
three meals a day.

211
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,860
Just a banana in the morning is fine.
But the most important thing is

212
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,320
SAVE MONEY
to never use the A/C or heat
in the summer or winter

213
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,650
SAVE MONEY
so that you can strengthen the mind.

214
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,450
In the beginning, you'll wish
you were dead.

215
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,580
You might start thinking
what's the harm of taking a day off?

216
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:11,250
But for me, in order to be a strong hero,
no matter how tough it was,

217
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,550
even if I was spitting blood,
I never stopped.

218
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:19,010
I kept doing squats even when my legs
were so heavy they refused to move.

219
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,430
Even when my arms started making
weird clicking noises,

220
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,480
I kept doing push-ups.

221
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,480
A year and a half later, I started
to notice a difference.

222
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,230
I was bald...

223
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,030
And I had become stronger!

224
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:40,030
In other words, you gotta train like hell
to the point where your hair falls out.

225
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:43,240
That's the only way to become strong.

226
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,250
The guys that are fooling around with

227
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:51,540
the "new human race" and evolution junk
will never make it this far.

228
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:56,010
Human beings are strong because
we have the ability to change ourselves.

229
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,470
W-What?

230
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,430
Is this guy...for real?

231
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,600
Master...

232
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,810
You are so...

233
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,850
full of crap!

234
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,060
Huh?

235
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,230
That is nothing but
standard strength training!

236
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,240
And it's not even that intense!
It's just a normal level!

237
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:27,080
I...I have to get stronger. I didn't ask
to study under you just to hear jokes!

238
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,330
Master Saitama,

239
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:34,960
your power is clearly stronger than
what you'd get from just training your body.

240
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,840
That's right, I want to know your--

241
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,220
We want to know your true secret!

242
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,430
Genos...

243
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:48,180
You may not believe me,
but that's really all I did.

244
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,980
Oh yeah?

245
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,230
No! Carnage Kabuto!

246
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:01,320
If you don't wanna tell us your secret...
so be it.

247
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,120
Stop! You'll go on another rampage!

248
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:10,960
I bet you aren't stronger than me anyway!

249
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:19,050
But, since you pissed me off,

250
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,090
I'm gonna annihilate you.

251
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,850
CARNAGE MODE
Carnage Mode!

252
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,650
When I get like this I lose control
for a whole week

253
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,820
and my lust for death cannot be quelled!

254
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:47,080
After I kill you, I'll head into town and go on
a killing rampage until next Saturday!

255
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,170
If you are indeed a strong hero,
then try and stop me!

256
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,510
No way... it can't be.

257
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,150
Master?!

258
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:22,740
Dammit. I may have made
a horrible mistake.

259
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,950
This guy's in Carnage mode...

260
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:32,370
He said he'll be on a rampage
for a whole week?

261
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,830
Death, death, death, death, death, death,

262
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,960
Death, death, death, death, death!!

263
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,840
He'll be like this till next Saturday?

264
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,470
One whole week from today...

265
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,050
Next Saturday...

266
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,680
In other words, today
is Saturday too.

267
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,140
That means.. .

268
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,440
It's all over.

269
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:01,320
There's no one in this world
that can stop him.

270
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,740
That means...
Today is...

271
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:11,490
Bargain day at the supermarket!!

272
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,090
Who the hell is this guy?

273
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,550
I screwed up!!!

274
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,220
What is he--

275
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,060
I'm pretty sure he's upset about this.

276
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,190
SATURDAY ONLY!!! GIGANTIC SALE!

277
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,400
Master, the store closes at 10:00 PM.

278
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:43,820
That is about four hours away.
If we really hurry, we can make it.

279
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,780
I'll make it if I hurry?

280
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,700
Yes!

281
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,660
Let's go, Genos!

282
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,070
Yes, Master!

283
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:54,790
I think I'm done with evolution.

284
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,250
It appears...
I am the one who must change.

285
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,190
Yes. The on-site investigation
is underway.

286
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,900
Yes, that's correct.

287
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,440
Just like the other cases, the area has been
thoroughly burnt by intense flames.

288
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:53,360
Everything points to the young cyborg
being responsible for this.

289
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,160
Yes, understood.

290
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:01,160
Such a devastating amount of power.

291
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,500
Yeah...

292
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:09,840
NEXT EPISODE: THE MODERN NINJA
Yo, this is Carnage Kabuto.
In Japanese my name is "Ashura Kabuto,"

293
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,840
NEXT EPISODE: THE MODERN NINJA
and the kanji come from "Shell," "Field Trip"
and the sanskrit word "Aum."

294
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,350
NEXT EPISODE: THE MODERN NINJA
Whaddaya think?
Bah, you don't give a damn!

295
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:20,730
NEXT EPISODE: THE MODERN NINJA
Coming next on One-Punch Man is
episode 4, "The Modern Ninja."

296
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:24,940
NEXT EPISODE: THE MODERN NINJA
So the guy is finally gonna show up?
