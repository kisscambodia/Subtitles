1
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,940
Though my true power
has been unleashed,

2
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,770
you are still able to keep up.

3
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,280
Yeah.

4
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,240
You're pretty strong, too.

5
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,160
Putting City A back together
might be impossible.

6
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,000
Well, right now I should be
focusing on the battle.

7
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,210
She may be rank 2 or whatever,

8
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,090
but I can't leave it
to one little girl.

9
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,890
I got my own ways of fighting
enemies in the air.

10
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,800
Like this!

11
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,230
Hey!

12
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,020
What do you think you're doing?

13
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,490
This area's got some nice rubble.

14
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,490
Hurry up and get out of my way.

15
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,370
She's using her psychic power?!

16
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,450
I give up!

17
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,920
We're under attack again!

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,170
Return fire!

19
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,680
The guns are jacked!

20
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,760
Seriously?! We're dead meat!

21
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,640
This planet's too tough!

22
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,640
Lord Boros!

23
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,850
I wanna go home…

24
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,860
Such incredible power.

25
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,030
Tornado may actually bring it
down on her own.

26
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:16,940
I have errands to run.

27
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,030
I will head out now.

28
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,530
Things appear under control.

29
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,490
Sure, go ahead.

30
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,000
Some heroes have already left.

31
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,080
Before I go, Genos,
have you got a second?

32
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,080
There's something
I wish to tell you.

33
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,920
Drive Knight, Class S, rank 9.

34
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,960
This is a first…

35
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,680
Listen.
Metal Knight is your "enemy."

36
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:43,850
Be careful.

37
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,760
What do you mean?

38
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,020
You will know soon enough.

39
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,060
But for now, stay away from him.

40
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,040
Bastard.

41
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,040
You sure make things interesting.

42
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,510
I'm beginning to taste victory.

43
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,430
The stiffness in
my shoulders is gone.

44
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,550
But I suppose I'm a little rusty.

45
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,010
You live—?

46
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,850
Hey. Forget something?

47
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,140
ATOMIC SLASH

48
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,060
Atomic Slash!
ATOMIC SLASH

49
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,230
Insolence...

50
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,360
Such complete insolence!

51
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:45,530
You move your heart-thing around
your body to hide its location.

52
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,290
But your regeneration always
begins with your head

53
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,670
and in the center lies…

54
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
…your heart.

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
After seeing it so much,
even a monkey'd figure it out.

56
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,010
See? Checkmate.

57
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,220
Noooooo!

58
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,180
Silverfang!

59
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,060
All I needed was one more swing.

60
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,890
Keep your hands to yourself,
Silverfang.

61
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,770
Goodness, I really do need
to do more full-body workouts.

62
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,900
We got all the heads.

63
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,070
That means…victory is ours!

64
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,080
Yah, but there's still that
big-ass ship up there.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,670
All right, this is the last of
the reported survivors.

66
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,670
Let's move!

67
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,840
Right.

68
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,300
Mumen!

69
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,050
Quit your staring and come on!

70
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,350
Yeah, okay.

71
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,900
Nice moves.

72
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,700
As I thought, you are strong.

73
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,870
Of all the myriad beings
I have fought, only you…

74
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,950
…survived this long!

75
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,750
Now to release the destructive energy
held within me!

76
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,840
Any normal creature hit by it would
find even their bones vaporized!

77
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,730
Behind you!

78
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,530
You were a worthy opponent,

79
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,700
but the outcome
of this battle is clear.

80
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,750
My species won
the struggle to survive

81
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,920
amidst the harsh environment
of our home world.

82
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:47,760
We possess the ultimate
in regenerative abilities.

83
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,590
I, in particular,
have self-healing power,

84
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,850
physical prowess and latent energy
beyond your conception.

85
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,520
A deep wound that would
be fatal for you

86
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,600
heals itself on me in mere moments.

87
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,520
By focusing all my energy
on my destroyed arm,

88
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,570
I can explosively speed up
the healing process.

89
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,320
Good as new.

90
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,240
You, on the other hand,
will only get injured more,

91
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,950
all while your stamina
gradually decreases—

92
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,080
Shut up.

93
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,410
Blah, blah, blah. Are you done?

94
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,080
With this?

95
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,090
Not yet!

96
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,190
Meteoric Burst!

97
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:09,210
The energy shunted from my body
transforms into a propelling force,

98
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,930
elevating speed and power
to a level beyond the limitations…

99
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,930
…of living flesh!

100
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,070
Doing this places enormous stress
on my body,

101
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,860
similar to anaerobic exercise.

102
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,910
As a result, it shortens my life.

103
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,030
Therefore,

104
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,500
it should only be used as a trump card
for settling fights quickly.

105
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,380
It's listing!

106
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,970
You're doing it!

107
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,050
Awesome, Tornado!

108
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,020
Oh.

109
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,940
I made it.

110
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,240
This man…

111
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,530
…makes me want to go all out!

112
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,430
That's the way, Saitama.

113
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,850
You are indeed worth defeating!

114
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,940
Consecutive Normal Punches.

115
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,860
I will defeat you!

116
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,990
All my energy will be released,

117
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,790
blasting you and
this planet to Hell!

118
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:04,010
Collapsing Star, Roaring Cannon!

119
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,060
In that case,
I'm using my final move too.

120
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,480
Killer Move: Serious Series…

121
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,650
…Serious Punch.

122
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,180
Did I…lose?

123
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,020
You're still conscious?

124
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,020
You really are strong.

125
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,150
The prophecy held true.

126
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,530
The battle was…hard-fought.

127
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,740
Yeah. It sure was.

128
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,160
You lie.

129
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,000
You had strength to spare.

130
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,210
I never stood a chance.

131
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:19,300
It wasn't even a battle.

132
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,550
So much for prophecies.

133
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,310
You were too strong…

134
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,850
Saitama…

135
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,860
THE STRONGEST HERO

136
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,040
It's crashing?

137
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,290
Is this Master's doing?

138
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,670
We're done!
The power sphere's been broken!

139
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,920
We're going down!

140
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,090
Lord Boros went wild!

141
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,760
Get out, get out!

142
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,640
– Run!
– Stop shoving, stupid!

143
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,890
I wanna go home, Mommy!

144
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:12,850
It's coming down.

145
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:13,640
Huh?

146
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,060
Hey, we better get outta here...!

147
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,900
This is bad.
Run for the Association HQ.

148
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,900
Iai! Hold on to me!

149
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,360
I'm okay, Master!

150
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,990
Damn. How'd Silverfang get so fast?

151
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,910
Now's not the time to
be competitive.

152
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,700
Angel Dash!

153
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,830
Hey pansy, don't you run
in front of me! You're too slow!

154
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,040
Angel Dash!

155
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,370
Don't just say it, move!

156
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:41,130
- We're gonna crash!
- We're gonna crash!

157
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,260
It's down.

158
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,930
All right, let's go.

159
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,880
How did City A end up like this?

160
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,920
HANDSOME KAMEN AMAI MASK
CLASS A RANK 1

161
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,340
All of Class S was meeting today…
HANDSOME KAMEN AMAI MASK
CLASS A RANK 1

162
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,550
Care to explain, Metal Bat?

163
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:31,720
Huh?

164
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,100
Explain it so I can understand.

165
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,020
Handsome Kamen Amai Mask…

166
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,980
Where the hell'd you pop up from?

167
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,070
I was filming a TV drama
in the next town.

168
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,610
There was a roar and tremors,

169
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:50,660
so I came and
found City A wiped out.

170
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,120
Monsters on a huge-ass ship
attacked us.

171
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,080
They fired artillery at us
and did all this.

172
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,210
But we took care of it.

173
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,920
"Took care of it," you say?

174
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,090
You call this victory?

175
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,130
Such incompetence.

176
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,930
I'm completely appalled
at all of you!

177
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,430
Hey.

178
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,310
You didn't even get here in time,
so don't go acting all big.

179
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,690
It's true I didn't make it in time,

180
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,150
but you all were right here.

181
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,980
You didn't save a single brick!

182
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:29,610
We were having a meeting inside
the headquarters building.

183
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,410
We went outside as soon as
the enemy attacked,

184
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,910
but the city was already in ruins.

185
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,790
So what?

186
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,830
You think if you tell them that,
the media will just let all this go?

187
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,920
You…

188
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,960
Whose side are you on?

189
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,920
We did our best.

190
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,260
I'm on the side of justice.

191
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:54,550
Having Class S heroes
this pathetic…

192
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,060
is an embarrassment.

193
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,850
Anybody this useless
should voluntarily retire.

194
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,190
Hey! Don't start talking crap with us!

195
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,190
Who's gonna care about a pop idol with
a face busted all to Hell?!

196
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,030
Do you have any idea
why I don't move up to Class S?

197
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,530
I remain Class A, Rank 1
so I can prevent

198
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:20,750
weak, good-for-nothing pissants
like you from moving up to Class S.

199
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:37,930
Metal Knight, you skip the meeting
and only show up now?

200
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,850
This is…

201
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,520
magnificent!

202
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,110
Metal Knight!

203
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,690
What are you doing here?

204
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,190
The battle is already done.

205
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,030
Metal Knight is your "enemy."

206
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,070
Genos, right?

207
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:01,040
Do not tell me you have come
to recover the spaceship.

208
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,370
Are you here

209
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,920
so you can create more powerful weapons
with the alien technology?

210
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:07,830
Precisely.

211
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,250
Powerful weapons
are a necessity…

212
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,130
for the sake of peace.

213
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,430
Even with powerful weapons,

214
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,600
in the hands of heroes like this,
they'd be wasted.

215
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,850
You're mine later, pretty boy.
Watch your ass.

216
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,520
Hey!

217
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,060
I found some alien survivors!

218
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,280
I thought Lord Boros never lost.

219
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,110
Are we going to be killed?

220
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,490
Maybe we can talk
our way out of this.

221
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,580
Aggh, I'm so hungry!

222
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,660
Idiot! Now's not the time for—

223
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,120
Shh! Someone's coming.

224
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,300
Amai Mask! What the—?

225
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,970
They did not deserve to live.
They were evil.

226
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,850
I swiftly implemented justice,
that's all.

227
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,390
I'm sure you understand,

228
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:06,890
Genos…

229
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,190
You've been busy since the exam.

230
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,940
But from what I saw of
the Deep Sea King incident and today,

231
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,860
you've mostly been a disappointment.

232
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,660
Best leave it.

233
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,910
Do not worry. I am fine.

234
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,790
He reminds me of how I was
before I met Master.

235
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,960
A man on edge…

236
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,460
too eager to eliminate evil.

237
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,210
Just like me,

238
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,090
he must have gone through
something terrible in his past.

239
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,680
Wait!

240
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,930
Where is Master Saitama?

241
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,940
Oh, I'm out!

242
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,480
Hey!

243
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:59,900
Why would a Class B like you
be inside the ship?

244
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,110
Master!

245
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,030
You are safe!

246
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,740
Hey, Genos!

247
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,080
We're done here. Let's go.

248
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,950
Did you defeat their leader?

249
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,920
Yeah, he was really strong.

250
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,380
Maybe the strongest I've faced.

251
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,250
I see.

252
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,550
So without you, Master,
the prophecy…

253
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,960
about the earth's destruction

254
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,470
– They're ignoring me?
– would have come true.

255
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,130
Nah.

256
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,050
Turns out you can't trust
prophecies to begin with.

257
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,970
Hold it right there!

258
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,770
I don't know how you did it,
but you went in the ship on your own?

259
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,890
You're just a Class B.
How dare you butt in like that?

260
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,520
I didn't need you. I could have
handled it on my own.

261
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,110
Baldy! Octopus! Boiled egg!
Light bulb! Avocado!

262
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,690
– G-Genos.
– Lame face! Goblin! Bug! Baldy!

263
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:38,900
– Say something.
– Ping-pong ball! Rice grain! Beanhead!

264
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,950
– Yes, sir.
– Kettle! Baldy! Kneecap!

265
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,950
Listen, spoiled brat.

266
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,910
Shut up and get lost,
or get beat down.

267
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,330
That's it! Yeah!

268
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,160
Unforgiveable. Me, a brat?

269
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,670
I'm older than you!

270
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,670
Genos?!

271
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,920
You're next, Class B!

272
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,920
Cut it out, Tornado.

273
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:02,880
You're part of the Association—
a hero, right?

274
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,140
Whatever.

275
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,600
Why are there so many troublemakers
amongst the elite heroes?

276
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,610
Genos… Your joints are all bent
the wrong way.

277
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,020
Here, I'll fix you up.

278
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,690
Oh sorry, your arm came off!

279
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,900
My back is killing me.

280
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:28,120
City A was wiped off the map
that day.

281
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,660
The arrival of aliens and

282
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,410
City A’s annihilation were
history-making events,

283
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,120
the top stories for days.

284
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,920
But eventually the coverage
died down

285
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,090
and no one mentioned the city
that had disappeared.

286
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,720
Metal Knight salvaged
the spaceship.

287
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,100
Soon thereafter,
the Hero Association headquarters

288
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,390
was reconstructed
all the stronger,

289
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,680
and became an impenetrable
fortress of steel.

290
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,980
The infrastructure was rebuilt
with new roads leading out of HQ.

291
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,230
Heroes were able to
deploy quickly to every city.

292
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,780
And heroes Class A and above
were given the option

293
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,370
to live at headquarters.

294
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,010
You can see it clearly!

295
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:52,010
The entire building has been ripped out
down to the foundations.

296
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:56,140
The monster appeared in City Z,
but now City Y is in—

297
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,320
PLUTON, KING OF THE UNDERWORLD

298
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,910
THREAT LEVEL: DRAGON

299
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,910
You humans waste
your existence in gluttony,

300
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:19,790
littering the earth with
worthless objects.

301
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,500
Now shall you boil and rot
in the depths of the underworld

302
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,500
that spreads below my mighty snout!

303
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,880
Who do we have here?

304
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:34,140
A great man who is a hero for fun…

305
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,390
and profit.

306
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,390
A great man?

307
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,110
And…his disciple.

308
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:58,080
Back to one punch again…

309
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,960
GOD DAMN IT!!
