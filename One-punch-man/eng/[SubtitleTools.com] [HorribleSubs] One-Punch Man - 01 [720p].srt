1
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,710
What on earth!

2
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,920
Look at that!

3
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,830
It's closing in!

4
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:00,500
Who's available?

5
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,250
We have word that Lightning Max
and Smile Man are on their way.

6
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,750
Get me that threat level assessment!

7
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,540
As you can see, loud explosions
are going off behind me!

8
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,830
The damage left by the monster
is at an unprecedented scale.

9
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,170
HUGE EXPLOSION IN CITY A
The Heroes Association is currently
analyzing the threat level--

10
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,750
Guess I'll go.

11
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,580
JUSTICE ENFORCEMENT

12
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,130
Daddy! Mommy!

13
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,920
And who do we have here?

14
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,040
Just a guy who's a hero for fun.

15
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,580
What kind...

16
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,540
of half-assed backstory is that?

17
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,040
I was formed from
the constant stream of pollution

18
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,540
with which you humans
have suffused the earth.

19
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,460
I am Vaccine Man!

20
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,710
The Earth is a single living organism.

21
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,130
You humans are nothing but
a disease-causing bacteria

22
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,330
eating away at her lifeforce.

23
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,670
In order to obliterate humans
and their evil civilization,

24
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,540
the Earth has given birth to me!

25
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,380
You say you do this for fun?
For fun?

26
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,040
How dare you confront me,
Mother Earth's apostle,

27
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,630
for that inane reason?!

28
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,500
Yet, what more could be
expected from a hu--

29
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,540
Not again...
All it took was one punch!

30
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,210
DAMN IT!

31
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,210
THREE YEARS EARLIER

32
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,040
- A monster!
- Run!

33
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,710
Huh?

34
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,210
You sure you
don't want to run away?

35
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,380
I bet you're a newly employed
businessman already tired of work.

36
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,080
I ate too much crab and
transformed into this, Crablante!

37
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,380
Why aren't you running?

38
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,000
You've got a death wish.

39
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,710
Is that it?

40
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,080
Well, not quite.

41
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:30,500
I'm no businessman. I'm unemployed.
Right now, I'm looking for a job.

42
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,750
I had another interview today
and got rejected royally.

43
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,830
I couldn't care less about anything.

44
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,130
So I'm in no mood to run

45
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,670
just because the mighty Crablante
has appeared.

46
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,380
So, what'll happen if I don't run?

47
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:55,000
Your eyes are lifeless, just like mine.

48
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,040
From one set of lifeless eyes
to another, I'll let you go.

49
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,250
Besides, right now...

50
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,130
I'm hunting different prey.

51
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,000
A big-chinned brat.

52
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,040
And when I find him,
I'm gonna rip his arms off!

53
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,170
What're you looking at?

54
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,960
A big-chinned brat...
If he's caught, he's dead!

55
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,290
Hey, kid. Were you messing
with a big crab monster?

56
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,500
Huh?

57
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,080
He was asleep in the park,

58
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,750
so I drew some nipples on him
with my marker.

59
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,210
It's definitely him...

60
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,960
He has no idea what he's done.
What do I do? I could still help...

61
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,500
But man, this kid isn't cute at all.

62
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,630
It's none of my business...
I should just walk away.

63
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,000
Right. I mean, who really cares?

64
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,830
I found you!

65
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,380
What the hell am I doing?

66
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,290
Huh!

67
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:15,040
Kid, he's after you!
Get outta here!

68
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,080
Don't worry about me. Just go!

69
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,420
B-But...

70
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,790
My soccer ball...

71
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,790
Your ball?!

72
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,040
Hey, what's the big idea?

73
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,500
Don't tell me you're gonna
protect that stinkin' brat!

74
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:38,250
Come on, you're gonna kill him
over some harmless prank?

75
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,670
Think about this!

76
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,210
I've already mutilated lots of people.

77
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,080
Whoever makes fun of
the way I look pays the price.

78
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,670
No exceptions.

79
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:55,960
By the way, that brat drew
nipples on my body.

80
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,580
With a permanent marker!

81
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,880
Look at these claws!
I can't even use a towel to wipe it off!

82
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,880
Get in my way, and I'll make sure
you never go job hunting again!

83
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,920
It just came to me.

84
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:23,250
You look exactly like a villain
from this anime I used to watch!

85
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,290
Die.

86
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,080
Hold it right there.

87
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,880
In this age of declining birth rates,
I can't just let you kill a kid.

88
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,920
You know what?

89
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,170
When I was a little boy,
I wanted to be a hero.

90
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,630
Not a businessman,

91
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,080
but a hero who could send
rotten villains like you flying

92
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,790
with one punch.

93
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,130
Screw looking for a job!

94
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,880
Bring it on!

95
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,130
Some hero you are!

96
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,630
You're pathetic!

97
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,710
You don't stand
a chance against me.

98
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:17,460
Your life ends...now!

99
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,790
Has it really been three years
since then?

100
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,210
After that day,
I trained so hard I went bald.

101
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,540
I became so powerful,
no one can beat me.

102
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,710
I'm the hero I dreamed of becoming.

103
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,380
So what is this? What's wrong?

104
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,880
Why does my heart feel so empty?

105
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,040
482 yen, please.

106
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,170
Okay.

107
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,790
Oh, hang on.

108
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,920
I have 82 yen.

109
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,960
Incredible...

110
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,000
This is incredible, little brother!

111
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,580
I never thought it would work so well.

112
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,080
Yes, it's more than
I ever imagined, big brother.

113
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,000
My goal was to become
the strongest man in the world.

114
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,420
The strongest man.

115
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,420
That was my dream.

116
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:18,210
At last, the ultimate steroid,
"Biceps King," is complete!

117
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,880
Little brother!

118
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,960
Drink this and you will obtain
the power you've been seeking!

119
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,290
What? Drink that?

120
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,670
Indeed! I added strawberry flavoring,
to make it go down easier.

121
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,500
Brother...

122
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,420
Yes, this will do!

123
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,290
My brains and your brawn!

124
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:50,580
By combining the greatest of minds
and the strongest of bodies,

125
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:55,130
we brothers will conquer everything
on earth

126
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,670
and rule as kings!

127
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,080
I-Incredible!

128
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,130
Well done, little brother.
Thousands have perished!

129
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:13,210
Now, on to the next town
to destroy it as well!

130
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,080
This! This is it, big bro.
This is what I was looking for...

131
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,170
To be the strongest man.

132
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,670
This is an emergency
evacuation warning.

133
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,000
A giant creature has
appeared in City D.

134
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:33,380
The creature is currently
heading towards City B.

135
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,960
All residents of the area,
please evacuate immediately.

136
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,170
I repeat, the giant creature
is currently heading for--

137
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,960
Yes, that's right! Scatter like rats!

138
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,380
Get them!

139
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,250
I'm the strongest man,

140
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,920
I'm the strongest man,
I'm the strongest man.

141
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,170
What do you think, brother?

142
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,630
Yeah, how's it feel
being the strongest?

143
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,670
What?!

144
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,080
There's someone on your shoulder!

145
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,080
Put some pants on.

146
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,250
That guy on your shoulder! Kill him!

147
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,000
Brotherrrr!

148
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:24,330
How did this happen?!
I just wanted to be strong!

149
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:28,040
And I finally am
the strongest man, but...!

150
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:37,080
I don't know who you are,
but it's your fault my brother is dead!

151
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,000
The strongest!

152
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,000
Behold our brotherly power!

153
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,290
I am the strongest.

154
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,380
So what if I am?

155
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,040
I feel empty.

156
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,960
Right?

157
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,500
Having overwhelming strength is...

158
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,710
...pretty boring.

159
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,580
Oops.

160
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:45,040
CITY B DESTROYED

161
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,580
There's no sign that the evils
of the world are disappearing.

162
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:08,080
This hasn't changed since
before I became a hero.

163
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:12,530
In other words, you could say that
I haven't made any impact.

164
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,910
I'm not necessarily sad about that.

165
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,370
But there's something
bothering me lately.

166
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,910
As the days pass,
my emotions grow more distant.

167
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,580
Fear, tension, joy, anger...
I feel none of them anymore.

168
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,870
In exchange for power,

169
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:35,030
maybe I've lost something
that's essential for a human being?

170
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,160
Vroom, vroom?

171
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,740
No sense hiding if you saw me.

172
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,910
I'm Super Custom YO649Z Mk. II!

173
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,370
I love...

174
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,830
- I used to feel all kinds of emotions
- building custom cars so much...

175
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,580
- whirling inside me when I fought.
- I decked myself out.

176
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:58,740
- Fear. Panic. Anger.
- I'm a custom car-loving monster!

177
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,080
If you're thinking of getting in my way,

178
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,030
I'll put a shine on
that big headlight of yours!

179
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,200
But now, all I need is
one punch to end it.

180
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,830
Guess I'll have eggs over rice tonight.

181
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,200
Each day...

182
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,740
I come home uninjured
and wash my gloves.

183
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:34,530
When I'm out fighting monsters,
I never feel as if my heart's really in it.

184
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:39,580
I mean, I just do the hero-thing
as a hobby.

185
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,870
In other words,

186
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:45,490
as long as I get a kick out of it,
that's all I care about.

187
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,830
My house?!

188
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,030
He's tough!

189
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,120
What the hell are you?

190
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:32,830
"What" am I? That's rude.
We are the true earthlings.

191
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:33,870
We?

192
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,780
I believe you call us
"Subterraneans."

193
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,120
We suffer from overpopulation.

194
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,910
Therefore, we must now
claim the world aboveground.

195
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,870
I understand that there are
many people on the surface too.

196
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,700
As it stands, you are in our way.

197
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,740
That is why we have decided to
eradicate you all.

198
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,620
Since our invasion commenced,

199
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,870
70% of the surface dwellers
have been killed.

200
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,910
This is a battle for survival.

201
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,700
I hope you can understand that.

202
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:12,490
However, this is unexpected.

203
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,490
We have encountered
no surface dwellers

204
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,700
whom our punches would not kill.

205
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,830
Same here.

206
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,450
It's been too long since
I've come across such worthy opponents,

207
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,120
Subterraneans!

208
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,280
We are earthlings!

209
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,160
But how?!

210
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,160
You bastard!

211
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,700
Die!

212
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,700
It's over.

213
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,780
What was that surface dweller?

214
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,280
I'm...

215
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:47,660
just a guy who's a hero for fun.

216
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,580
I do not lose!

217
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,780
And the surface...

218
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,950
is under my protection!

219
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,780
Big talk for a race of vermin!

220
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,780
What is this feeling?

221
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,160
This wild throbbing in my heart?!

222
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:26,530
This rush, this tension!

223
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,330
It's been so long, I forgot

224
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:40,830
the exhilaration of a real fight!

225
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,870
It's coming back to me.

226
00:20:58,530 --> 00:20:59,700
This is it.

227
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,990
Well, well...

228
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:06,530
Looks like you've been taking
good care of my children.

229
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,120
This is it!

230
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:12,280
I, the Subterranean King,
will take you on.

231
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:17,910
This is the very feeling
I've been looking for!

232
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,620
The surface is ours!

233
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,700
You surface dwellers must die!

234
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,990
I am the Subterranean King!

235
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:44,620
Surface dwellers,
prepare yourselves for--

236
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,410
All right, bring it on!

237
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,950
SORRY ABOUT THAT

238
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,620
I've become too strong.

239
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:14,870
THE STRONGEST MAN

240
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,410
NEXT EPISODE:
THE LONE CYBORG

241
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,660
How'd you like seeing me
get ripped apart this week?

242
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,160
Now it's time for me,
the mighty Crablante,

243
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,200
to tell you what happens next week.

244
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,370
Huh? There are no visuals?

245
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:18,370
Well, next week this guy appears
in Z City where Saitama lives!

246
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,280
What now? Time's up?

247
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:24,030
Well next week will be episode 2,
"The Lone Cyborg."

248
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,330
I hope you all--
