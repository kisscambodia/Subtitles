1
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,580
Long have I awaited
this moment, human filth.

2
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,000
With the Subterranean and
Deep Sea kings gone,

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,550
the Terror Lizard Clan can
at last reclaim rulership of the Earth!

4
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,980
Now leading target towards
point Bravo.

5
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,400
Roger.

6
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,730
We are inbound and on schedule.

7
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,320
We'll be on top of Bravo shortly.

8
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:21,890
UNPARALLELED PERIL

9
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,690
And who are you?

10
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,440
Hello? What is it?

11
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,570
What do you mean, come back?!

12
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,200
You're the one who said
some weirdo monster was waking up

13
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,370
and flew me out here!

14
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,080
Weirdo...?

15
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,950
That's right.
I was just about to start.

16
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,580
Listen well!
I am the Ancient King.

17
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,130
– As ruler of the dinosaurs
– "Trouble?" So what?

18
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,880
– who once ruled this planet,
– It's not my problem.

19
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,210
– I stand above all other lifeforms.
– Hey, shut it!

20
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,470
Can't you see
I'm on the phone here?!

21
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,470
I'm so tired of this.

22
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,680
Who's he think he is,
ordering people about?

23
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,890
Are you done?

24
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,980
What's with the chin?
Trying to be scary?

25
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,100
Should I be intimidated?

26
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,360
Act brave while
you still can, little runt.

27
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,360
Runt?! How dare you!

28
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,370
Ah, so you aren't helpless!

29
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:53,960
But if you intend to destroy me,
a giant meteor is about the only way.

30
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,380
Fine. I'll do that then.

31
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,840
Don't make me laugh.

32
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,730
How about another
300,000,000 year nap?

33
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,410
Fist of Flowing Water, Crushed Rock.

34
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,830
It goes something like that.

35
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,000
Want to try?

36
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,960
You both look like quick learners.

37
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,050
I bet you'll get the hang of it
in no time.

38
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,850
This is the cool thing you said
you wanted to show us?

39
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,050
A sales pitch?

40
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,600
I'll pass. You do it, Genos.

41
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,850
No, I will pass too.

42
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,020
What I seek is not
the art of self-defense,

43
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,690
but absolute destructive power.

44
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,900
You punks!

45
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,280
You dare mock our fighting style?!

46
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,900
I, Charanko, the top disciple,

47
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,110
challenge you—

48
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,700
I give up!

49
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,950
Is he really your best?

50
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,910
Yeah...

51
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,620
I heard your dojo was
full of skilled fighters.

52
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,500
Well, one of my disciples went wild.

53
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,300
He beat my most skilled students

54
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,840
so badly they're all
out of commission.

55
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,930
The rest got scared and quit.

56
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,800
He's that strong?
What's his name?

57
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,600
Garo...

58
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,270
He was my top disciple
at the time,

59
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,060
but I gave him a good beating
and expelled him.

60
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,020
You must pack a punch, old man.

61
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,400
Hey! This is the famed hero "Silverfang!"

62
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,530
Class S hero, rank 3.

63
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,780
He toys with opponents
as he flows like water,

64
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,620
then delivers a blow like
a raging river smashing huge rocks!

65
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,240
A master of martial arts!

66
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,500
You only became
a hero recently, right?

67
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,290
You'll regret taking
Master Bang lightly!

68
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,920
Enough, Charanko!

69
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,510
Do not disgrace us.

70
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,050
Saitama is many times
stronger than me.

71
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,800
Master, you can't be serious...

72
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,050
Mr. Silverfang!

73
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,720
The Association sent me.

74
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,100
An emergency summons has been
issued to all Class S heroes!

75
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,060
Please come to
Association Headquarters.

76
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:24,020
Oh! Is that you, Mr. Genos?

77
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,280
Since all Class S heroes have
been summoned, please come too.

78
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,950
Is it threat level Dragon?

79
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,700
Here we go...

80
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,490
Charanko, look after the dojo.

81
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,870
Be careful, Master!

82
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,880
If Class S is being summoned,
they may need your help too, Master.

83
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,840
Will you come?

84
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,630
I will…since I got nothing to do.

85
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,170
HERO ASSOCIATION HQ

86
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,560
Oh ho, Silverfang!

87
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,310
It's been a while, Atomic Samurai.

88
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,900
I knew you'd come.

89
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,110
And this is the cyborg Genos and...

90
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,530
Hm? Who's this?

91
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,110
This is the Class B hero Saitama.

92
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,450
His exceptional talent will one day
place him atop Class S, I'm sure,

93
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,280
so we asked him to come.

94
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,240
Hi, middle-aged hero dude!

95
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,950
Put 'er there!

96
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:22,170
No handshakes.
I acknowledge only the strong.

97
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,460
Once you've climbed up to Class S,
I'll greet you properly.

98
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,050
Besides, I'm not middle-aged yet.

99
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,800
I'm only 37.

100
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,180
37 isn't middle-aged?
I had no idea…

101
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,810
Hey, who brought
a Class B nobody along?

102
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,810
Don't you think it's beneath us?

103
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:45,110
And even if you were invited,
a polite person would decline. The nerve!

104
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,150
I bet you're only here
for some creepy reason

105
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,980
like getting close to
us Class S heroes.

106
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,940
You disgust me. Leave.

107
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,740
What's with this sassy...
lost child?

108
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,620
That is Tornado. Class S, rank 2.

109
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,950
– "That"? I am not an object!
– She defeats monsters

110
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,080
with her psychic powers.

111
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,920
She is an ESPer.

112
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Oh yeah...?

113
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,750
It appears everyone is here.

114
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,500
We should join them.

115
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,510
Hey...

116
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,010
Stop ignoring me!

117
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,770
CLASS S RANK 17
PURI-PURI PRISONER

118
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,810
Maybe this will be my chance
to get closer to Genos...

137

I was hoping to see him.

CLASS S RANK 3
SILVERFANG

142

Who knows? I had to drop everything
and then got kept waiting for two hours.

Can I have some tea?
CLASS B RANK 63
SAITAMA

146
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,220
My apologies for being late.

147
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,600
We do not know the whereabouts
of Metal Knight or Blast,

148
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,310
nor can we reach them.

149
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,730
No sense waiting any longer,

150
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,520
so let's begin
this emergency meeting.

151
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,110
You can call me Sitch.

152
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,820
I'm with the Association.
I will be briefing you.

153
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,490
Let's get right down to brass tacks.

154
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,910
You heroes are here because
you're the best of the best.

155
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,990
And now...

156
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:07,330
We're asking you to save the Earth!

157
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:13,500
However, even with your Class S skills,
there is no guarantee of survival.

158
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,130
Walking away also takes courage.

159
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:20,140
Should you choose to do so now,
you will retain Class S status.

160
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:25,100
But those who stay and hear me out
will not be allowed to walk away.

161
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,560
You will be confined here
until the incident is over

162
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,020
in order to avoid a general panic.

163
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,070
Are you all willing to hear this?

164
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,990
Whatever's going on,

165
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,990
it better be worth calling
all of us here.

166
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,990
I skipped out on my little sister's
piano recital for this.

167
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,000
If it's a load of crap,

168
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,080
I'm gonna tear
this whole building apart.

169
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,960
Like you could do that
with that skinny stick.

170
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,340
Yeah? How 'bout I bust
your head open instead?

171
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,880
If you think you can,
go on and try, pillbug head!

172
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,340
Hurry up and get on with it.

173
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,140
Otherwise Mr. Pompadour here
is going to die.

174
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,930
Hey, bobby pin,
you siding with the girls?

175
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:12,770
The great seer, Madame Shibabawa,
is dead!

176
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,190
Shibabawa? Was she killed?

177
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
No.

178
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,990
While looking into the future
for the next six months,

179
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,780
she became agitated and
had a coughing fit.

180
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,330
She popped a cough drop
in her mouth

181
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,790
and ended up choking on it...

182
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,080
I get it!

183
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,710
So we have to figure out
how to prevent disasters

184
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,210
without the help of predictions.

185
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,920
That's the focus of this meeting.

186
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,170
No. Madame Shibabawa
has only been able to predict

187
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,050
a handful of disasters.

188
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,140
Excuse me!

189
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,930
Hey, you there.

190
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,640
Who's this Shibabawa? A hero?

191
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,350
You don't know?

192
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,980
She's a seer.
A great one at that.

193
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,270
She correctly predicted earthquakes
and monster attacks.

194
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:00,990
We've gotten through many crises
without Madame Shibabawa's predictions.

195
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,030
But even so,
we provided a bodyguard

196
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,950
and gave her special treatment.

197
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,580
Yes, because her few predictions
were 100% accurate.

198
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,000
The crux of the problem,
though,

199
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,920
is her last, greatest prophecy.

200
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,010
Even as she choked on
that final cough drop,

201
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,840
she managed to leave this note.

202
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,390
It is a prophecy that will
absolutely come to pass.

203
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,800
Here it is!

204
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,890
Can you read it?

205
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,930
– Th-The earth...
– Th-The earth...

206
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,060
– ...is in trouble?!
– ...is in trouble?!

207
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,770
THE EARTH IS IN TROUBLE

208
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,690
What? That's so dumb.

209
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,940
Can I go? I have cram school.

210
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,360
I know you are a prodigy,
Child Emperor,

211
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,080
but if you cannot grasp the danger,
it reveals how immature you still are.

212
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,700
What'd you say?!

213
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,000
Listen up!

214
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:56,580
Madame Shibabawa's predictions
are 100% accurate!

215
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,840
She has predicted many catastrophes
in the past.

216
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,300
A few of them resulted in
the loss of countless lives.

217
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:11,310
But not once did Madame Shibabawa
use the word "trouble."

218
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:16,060
Something more dangerous than a Dragon-
level catastrophe or monster is on its way.

219
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,940
And it will occur…

220
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,480
…in the next six months!

221
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,200
Okay, but we've no idea
when in the next six months.

222
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,030
Yeah, hard to plan for that.

223
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,910
You are correct.

224
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:37,500
But I want you all to be ready
for a fight in the next six months.

225
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,710
In the next six months means...

226
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,170
it could be tomorrow, or even today.

227
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:46,090
That's true. Who are you, anyway?

228
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,300
Good thing I'm here.

229
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,430
The building is under attack!

230
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,180
That's impossible!

231
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,350
This is the Hero Association HQ!

232
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:10,240
A formidable fortress, to be sure!

233
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,910
Time to attack.

234
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,660
Hawk, Eagle, Falcon, Kite!

235
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,620
– Yar!
– Yar!

236
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,920
Wipe out these so-called heroes
and the land will belong to us!

237
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,090
We will dive straight in!

238
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,760
Follow me, the Sky King!

239
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,090
Father...above us...

240
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,140
Escape...

241
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:36,930
Me, the Sky King, killed like
some worthless insect.

242
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,560
Who could have—

243
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,230
What was that?

244
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,860
– Who knows?
– It flew, so we killed it.

245
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,150
That is good.

246
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:49,240
Duty, to protect ship.

247
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,850
Emergency power activated.

248
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,930
What was that?

249
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,980
What's going on out there?

250
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,190
I don't know.

251
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,600
All communications have been cut off.

252
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,230
Damn it...

253
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,030
Impossible!

254
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,240
Dad!

255
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,290
We're okay now. Grab on to me.

256
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,120
That's the way.

257
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,210
Good job.

258
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,350
What is this?

259
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,100
There are survivors?

260
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,270
– Ship, failed to kill all.
– Then we kill.

261
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,810
That is good.

262
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,030
Get away now!

263
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,910
You think I don't sense
your thirst for blood?

264
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,330
I accompanied Master Atomic

265
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,130
and was waiting for
the Class S meeting to end,

266
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,710
only to meet thunder
and destruction.

267
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,920
Is this your doing?!

268
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:37,720
Destruction levels at 99.8%?

269
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,850
City A has been destroyed in an instant!

270
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:45,900
Who could have known her prediction
would come true this soon?!

271
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,860
Hey! Why was this building spared?

272
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,110
We assigned Metal Knight
to construct this building.

273
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:55,030
That's why it's stronger
than the average shelter.

274
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,570
So that's why there're no windows.

275
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:02,540
We should go outside and see.
To be sure it's the prophecy.

276
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,120
Master! Will you—

277
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,210
Master...

278
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:14,300
That's big!
Are they aliens?

279
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,150
So that's what blew
the city to pieces.

280
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,860
Go back to...

281
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,450
your planet!

282
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,290
A militant creature.

283
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,250
Also cautious.

284
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,630
Hurry. Let us hurry and kill.

285
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,960
That is good.

286
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,880
Can it be killed?

287
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,840
Each of its strikes is lethal!

288
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,890
I can't beat this thing...

289
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,850
Such a weak species.

290
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,350
Easily killed.

291
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,980
That is good.

292
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,440
It's splitting?

293
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,480
Damn, not now...

294
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,940
I will dispose of this.
You handle the rest.

295
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,110
Very well.

296
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,910
I will go kill those that ran.

297
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,070
That is good.

298
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,070
I—

299
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,410
Master!

300
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:28,040
Iairon, you okay?

301
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,580
You know, your left arm...

302
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:33,960
Master! Swords have no effect
on this monster.

303
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,090
Forget me! Retreat!

304
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:38,970
Outta my way!

305
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,390
Iai! The path of the sword does
not end for you yet!

306
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,640
Stop bleeding!

307
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,560
Yes, Master!

308
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:02,950
So there is a life-form on
this planet that can fight.

309
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,200
Excellent!

310
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,160
Try to withstand our invasion!

311
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:11,000
Planet, eh? You from outer space?

312
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,090
And you got friends up
in that floaty toy?

313
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,670
Yeah, that's it.

314
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,340
I doubt you alone have the power
to do all this to the city.

315
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,430
Atomic Samurai, count us in.

316
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,970
You the bastard that smashed
this town?!

317
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,810
And if I am?

318
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,060
For all the beautiful men
you killed...

319
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,610
I claim vengeance!

320
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:40,610
Each separate attack must
be delivered with intent...

321
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,740
...to kill!

322
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,530
Dark Angel

323
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,580
Flash!

324
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:54,040
Issue an evacuation warning to
City A and all neighboring cities.

325
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,830
Right now!

326
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,880
And expand the System M vitals monitor
to cover all of City A.

327
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,380
We need an accurate count
of the survivors.

328
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,720
What's the threat level?

329
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,140
"Dragon," without doubt.

330
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,180
No...

331
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,230
This might be "God."

332
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,940
Four Class S heroes can take care
of the enemy on the ground...

333
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,940
The problem is that.

334
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,860
We can't reach it.

335
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,030
Any aircraft would be
shot down in seconds.

336
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,830
King, you're one of
the top fighters in Class S.

337
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,700
Give us your take.

338
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,910
King, Class S rank 7.

339
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,960
Said to be the strongest man
on Earth,

340
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,000
and I see he is well respected
by the other heroes…

341
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,710
There's nothing I can do.

342
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,510
It's too high in the sky.
There's no way to attack it.

343
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,520
But the mysterious craft
is currently dormant.

344
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,980
We should use this opportunity
to call in Metal Knight.

345
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,770
What the—?! That's pathetic!

346
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,940
Aren't you supposed
to be the strongest man?

347
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,770
Hey, Tornado.

348
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,940
– This city's been blown away,
– If you piss King off, he'll kill you.

349
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,110
and you're just going
to give them a free hand?

350
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,110
Unbelievable!

351
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,700
Well forget it!
I'll take care of this myself.

352
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,330
Wait, I will go too.

353
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,670
I do not know how effective I can be,

354
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,830
but I will attack from the ground.

355
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,380
Maybe you didn't hear me.

356
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,300
I said forget about it!

357
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,260
Take it easy, Genos.

358
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,260
I understand how you feel,
but if you piss her off, she'll kill you.

359
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,260
Very well...

360
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,770
There is no need to
team up anyway.

361
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:37,150
Master has already boarded
the enemy ship.

362
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,440
Whether this is the prophecy or not,

363
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,150
there's not a single evil
Master cannot defeat.

364
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,490
If such an evil existed,

365
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:48,700
then I assume the human race
would have perished long ago.

366
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,370
Well done making it this far, intruder!

367
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:58,170
But this is the end.

368
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:02,460
You see, there is no way
you can defeat me, Groribas!

369
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,050
My Acid Breath will melt you away!

370
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,570
Isn't it about time the boss
showed up?

371
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,110
Well, if he's alive...

372
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,590
I, Groribas, control this preview!
THE DOMINATOR OF THE UNIVERSE

373
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:11,840
I perfected some new moves.
Now I have like 20!
THE DOMINATOR OF THE UNIVERSE

374
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,970
But I couldn't show them off,

375
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,970
because, you know,
they killed me off first!

376
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,270
Next time on One-Punch Man:

377
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,930
Episode 11,
"The Dominator of the Universe."

378
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,230
It's your fight now, Lord Boros!
