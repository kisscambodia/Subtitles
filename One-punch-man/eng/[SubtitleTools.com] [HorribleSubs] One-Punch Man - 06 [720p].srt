1
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,780
It's been five days since I debuted
as a professional hero.

2
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,950
There haven't been
any serious incidents so far.

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,490
However, for some reason Genos
is staying at my house.

4
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,910
What are you writing over there?

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,040
I'm recording the details of
your lessons and training regimen.

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,210
Crap. He's raising the bar again…

7
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,460
I can't think of a single thing
I can teach the guy.

8
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,260
I feel bad, like I'm scamming him
or something.

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,140
Come on, think. Or just make up
some techniques or a spiritual theory.

10
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,100
Bah, strength training is all I've got!

11
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,770
I know Genos won't be satisfied
with that, plus the dude's a cyborg!

12
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:44,560
By the way,

13
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,770
at the seminar
they said if you're a Class C hero

14
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,940
and you have no hero activity
for a week,

15
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,740
your name will be removed
from the Hero Registry.

16
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,450
Will you be all right, Master?

17
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,450
They said that?!

18
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,280
Yes.

19
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,580
But I was watching TV and
there wasn't anything going on.

20
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,660
The news only reports
major incidents,

21
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,000
like natural disasters, terrorism
and dangerous monsters.

22
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,000
You always fight
the most powerful enemies,

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,420
so you probably do not know it,

24
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,420
but Class C heroes primarily
take care of purse snatchers,

25
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,840
robberies and random attacks.

26
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,800
With Class C so full of heroes,

27
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,510
to survive they must actively
look for cases to resolve.

28
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,850
I hear many of them get discouraged
and change careers.

29
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,060
Like a salesman doing cold calls,

30
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,110
nothing will come your way
without legwork.

31
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,650
This is no time to be reading manga!

32
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,820
So we're going?

33
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,860
You stay here!

34
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,490
If I'm with a Class S hero,

35
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,160
a Class C like me
won't get any credit!

36
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,740
But as your disciple—

37
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,120
Genos, from the beginning
my intense desire to be a hero

38
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,540
was what drove me
to strength training.

39
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,830
That's how I made it this far.

40
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:55,380
For you, perhaps things will change
if you aim higher as a hero.

41
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,090
Frankly speaking, you're a cyborg,
so training your body won't do.

42
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,100
Instead, a change in mindset
may lead you to greater strength.

43
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,310
Damn, I'm just making
all this crap up…

44
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,860
So…in other words,

45
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,150
HOW I DEVELOPED
INDOMITABLE WILL
BY S CLASS HERO KING
it's not about having
raw power or technique;

46
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,440
HOW I DEVELOPED
INDOMITABLE WILL
BY S CLASS HERO KING
it's about training your mind.

47
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,450
HOW I DEVELOPED
INDOMITABLE WILL
BY S CLASS HERO KING
To do that,

48
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,950
you must first fight your way through
the professional hero industry.

49
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:24,200
Aim to break into the top ten
of the Class S heroes.

50
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,040
That will be your goal for now.

51
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,920
I understand. I will try!

52
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,800
He bought it… Sweet.

53
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,140
After that, I sped around town.

54
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,640
While frantically looking
for bad guys…

55
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:46,810
I ran.

56
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,230
And ran.

57
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,350
And ran.

58
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,230
But!

59
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,940
The city was quiet!

60
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,690
I give up…

61
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,150
Just one more day left.

62
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,620
Guess I'll head home.

63
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,170
I'll leave tomorrow's problems
to tomorrow's me.

64
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,640
THE FOLLOWING DAY

65
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,680
It's quiet today too!

66
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,810
There's nothing to do!

67
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,980
I'm gonna lose my registration!

68
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,990
Hey! You're that guy…

69
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:04,900
What was it?

70
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,320
"Seed-on-the-Ground…"?

71
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,700
No wait, "Lost-and-found…"?

72
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,990
Jack-o'-lantern Panic!

73
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,540
It's Speed-o'-Sound Sonic.

74
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,790
I've finally found you, Saitama.

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,040
Today is the day we—

76
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,300
Hey sorry, I'm busy. See you 'round..

77
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,170
Huh?

78
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,010
You think…

79
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,430
…you can run from me?!

80
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,140
What the—?
I didn't see what happened.

81
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,310
His face should have been
sliced open, but the blade…

82
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,980
I told you…I'm busy.

83
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,900
Plus I'm pissed,
so anyone in my way…

84
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,280
…gets punched.

85
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,910
That's him!

86
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,290
He's very, very dangerous.

87
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,870
Please stop him.

88
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,500
So you're the offender, eh?!

89
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,920
Well, the hero Tank-Top Tiger
is here now!

90
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,210
Hero?

91
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,890
Sonic, they think you're
some sort of criminal.

92
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,510
Maybe getting tossed in a cell
will cool off your hot—

93
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,640
She means you, cue ball.

94
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,140
Huh?

95
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,230
He's been running around town

96
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,690
with this scary look on his face
since yesterday!

97
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,400
But I'm a hero too!

98
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,440
I've never heard of a hero like you.

99
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,280
So what? I just started!

100
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,830
In any case, you're causing
problems for everyone.

101
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,580
If you're really a hero, then don't
go around frightening people.

102
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,420
You're hurting
all the other heroes' reputation.

103
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,960
Hey isn't that Tank-Top Tiger?

104
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,000
Oh yeah, it is Tank-Top Tiger.

105
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,130
No way!

106
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,550
Awesome, he's the real deal!

107
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,720
Even Class C heroes get recognized
if they're in the top 10.

108
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,140
So how â€˜bout it, new guy?

109
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,980
Wanna go a little wild here
and make me look good?

110
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,650
Exploding Shuriken.

111
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,570
EXPLODING SHURIKEN

112
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,360
Tank-Top Tiger?!

113
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,740
Is this really happening?

114
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,160
What are you doing, Sonic?

115
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:20,210
He was interfering,
so I put him to sleep.

116
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,170
Hey, call a hero!

117
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:22,960
A hero!

118
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,080
Run!

119
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,210
Saitama…

120
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,880
So you too have become one of
these worthless "heroes?"

121
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,510
Then all I have to do
is create a situation

122
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:38,770
where you have no choice
but to fight me, Saitama the Hero!

123
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,100
Hail of Carnage!

124
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,280
Huh?

125
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,660
Hey! Cut it out!

126
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,700
Saitama, come stop me!

127
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,290
You're a hero!

128
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,750
I'll kill them all!

129
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,670
Damn it.

130
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,460
Can't everyone
just let me do my job?

131
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,300
I don't have time for this!

132
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,760
I gotta find a bad guy to take down.

133
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,020
A bad guy?

134
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,100
If you're not coming, I'll go to you!

135
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,860
I'm right here.

136
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,080
I wonder if this will count as work?

137
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,370
The man apprehended in City Z
by the Class C hero

138
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,460
is suspected of being involved in
several heinous crimes,

139
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,920
including assassination.

140
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,800
City Z…

141
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,050
What's the status of
the investigation I requested?

142
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,180
The one for the ghost town?

143
00:08:59,220 --> 00:08:59,720
Yes.

144
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,010
Let's see…

145
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,430
We've submitted an official request.

146
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,310
Well now,
doesn't that sound interesting.

147
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,110
Want me to go?

148
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,690
Tornado?

149
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,990
Where'd you come from?

150
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,070
Why? Aren't I allowed in here?

151
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,070
Of course.

152
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:20,530
But for City Z,
the investigation is just a formality.

153
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,450
What?

154
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,710
You think I'm not good enough?

155
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,130
Not at all.

156
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,340
The Association decided that
this was not a Class S matter.

157
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,380
Yes, exactly right.

158
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,680
You'd better tell me if you find
anything that looks like it can fight.

159
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,350
It'd be so much faster
if I just went myself.

160
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,860
You're such an idiot.

161
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,350
CITY A –
HERO ASSOCIATION HQ

162
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,140
CITY A –
HERO ASSOCIATION HQ
Reports have come in from
each location being investigated.

163
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,140
Reports have come in from
each location being investigated.

164
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,980
First is Watchdog Man,
Class S hero, investigating City Q.

165
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,060
"Nothing unusual."

166
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,440
Nothing unusual?

167
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,520
– That's right.
– That's hard to believe.

168
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,280
We all know City Q is a hot zone

169
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,990
with more casualties and monsters
than any other area.

170
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,120
Knowing him,
I'm sure he's implying that,

171
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,750
"Whatever occurs,
I'll be able to take care of it."

172
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,210
Though he has focused
his efforts on City Q,

173
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,670
his track record at
monster elimination is top-notch.

174
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,170
Class S heroes don't
pay much attention to details.

175
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,130
They're not cut out
for writing reports.

176
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,930
Next, City W.

177
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,720
Class A hero Heavy Kong reports:
"Nothing unusual."

178
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,020
For City H, reports from Mushroom,
Class B, and Horsebone, Class C:

179
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,060
"Nothing unusual."

180
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,770
For City D, Lightning Genji,
Class A:

181
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,570
"Slow restoration after
the devastation caused by"

182
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,150
"the gigantic creature aside,
nothing unusual."

183
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:21,910
Cities B and D
both sustained extensive damage.

184
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,070
The Association took
a lot of heat for that.

185
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,990
In order to prevent
more such disasters,

186
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,330
we must detect any covert activity
that could threaten the community.

187
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,630
Well, this investigation was
requested for that express purpose.

188
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,840
But early detection of monsters
is proving difficult.

189
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,430
City F, Class A hero,
"Snakebite" Snek.

190
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,220
"Hammerhead, former leader
of the Paradiser terrorist group,"

191
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:49,020
"has been spotted
in a suit and tie."

192
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,810
"Further investigation
is being conducted."

193
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,060
No other reports.

194
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,020
What of City Z?

195
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,360
I hear rumblings of
a potential disaster brewing

196
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,150
in the abandoned area there.

197
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,690
No reports available.

198
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,070
However, two highly capable
Class A heroes

199
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,160
have been sent to the area
to investigate.

200
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,580
Here we are in City Z.

201
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,420
CLASS A, RANK 33 –
SPRING MUSTACHIO
Shall we begin our little inquiry?

202
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,210
CLASS A, RANK 29 –
GOLDEN BALL
Yeah, let's get on with it.

203
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:29,140
City Z is quite expansive,
but further ahead lies

204
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,140
the uninhabited area
we were told about.

205
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:33,890
Compared with other areas,

206
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:38,190
BEWARE OF MONSTERS!!
City Z has an abnormally high rate
of monster-related incidents.

207
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:42,320
The frequency has been gradually
increasing over the past 10 years,

208
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,570
while the last few have seen
more and more

209
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,030
highly advanced monsters appearing.

210
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,660
The residents have entirely fled
for the city center.

211
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:50,990
I know all that.

212
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,120
The place is a real ghost town,

213
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,080
just with the water and electricity
still intact, yeah?

214
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,380
On the lookout for a cheap house?

215
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,750
Come off it.

216
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:03,010
People say something
real nasty's living 'round here.

217
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,720
Even you must've heard.

218
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,180
But of course.

219
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:10,470
I assume that's why we have been
assigned this investigation.

220
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,480
Once we hit the abandoned area,
we better be ready to fight.

221
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:19,110
Indeed,
we mustn't let our guard down.

222
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,320
But, why here?
Why the increase in monsters here?

223
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,400
That's the mystery.

224
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,330
Many theories have been advanced,
but my own is this:

225
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,040
A colony of monsters here is
naturally producing more of them.

226
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,080
Or perhaps a queen exists,
birthing more of her kind.

227
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,550
Of course I have no proof yet,

228
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,550
but there is something
to this ghost town…

229
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,640
Or rather, something in it.

230
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,640
Of that you can be sure.

231
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,520
The proximity alarm?

232
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,810
If we can hunt down
this mysterious being,

233
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,360
we'll go straight to
the top of the rankings.

234
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,730
That's true.

235
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,530
We can't let Mr. Amai Mask
remain first for—

236
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,030
– Something's there?!
– Something's there?!

237
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,450
Was that a monster?

238
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,990
No way to be sure…

239
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,120
But it's hard to imagine a human
still living in these conditions.

240
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:14,950
Let's pursue it!

241
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,460
Seems they are not after us.

242
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,260
Can this be the place
I heard about?

243
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,380
Sure don't seem like it…

244
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,140
Aw man, I came all this way.
Isn't anyone around?

245
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,890
A monster.
It popped up out of nowhere.

246
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,560
Golden Ball, are you ready?

247
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,770
Hell yes.

248
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,610
Victory to the swift!

249
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,070
Hey, people!

250
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,030
I can blast through
a 20mm steel plate

251
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,530
with one of my shape-memory
golden bullets!

252
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,030
Eat this!

253
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,130
He flicked it away like nothing.

254
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,140
Golden Ball!

255
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,210
Wow!

256
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,890
Tomboy…

257
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,350
…thrust!

258
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,570
It slipped past my Tomboy?

259
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,160
Not bad.

260
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,240
Those tentacles…

261
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,830
From the way they react,
they're tough as steel.

262
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,040
A monster that can use
its infinite number of tentacles

263
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,380
like steel whips…

264
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,710
Such power!

265
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,390
I must call in reinforcements
from the Association.

266
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,350
May I ask if you were born
in this neighborhood?

267
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,890
Nah, I'm from out of town.

268
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:49,190
I heard a bunch of crazy strong monsters
were all getting together here.

269
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,490
Looks like it was
just a rumor though.

270
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
But now,

271
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:02,580
I feel like it'd be kinda fun to
stick around and make the rumor true.

272
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,750
"The Ghost Town Monster…"

273
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's got a nice ring to it!

274
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:12,340
We have a backup request from
the heroes dispatched to City Z.

275
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,760
Class A rank 29, Golden Ball,
has been knocked out.

276
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,550
Class A rank 33,
Spring Mustachio, is in trouble.

277
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,060
They're in the abandoned city.

278
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,970
Call in all nearby heroes
for immediate assistance!

279
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,600
Class A and above!

280
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,690
See the monster alert for City Z?

281
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:30,070
The threat level seems to be
Tiger or higher.

282
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,190
Is it the ghost town monster?

283
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,110
They're not sure yet.

284
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,780
I'll go…

285
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:39,200
I want to catch the tiger
by its tail.

286
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,210
Now I see…

287
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,630
If it means running into monsters
like this all the time

288
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,890
I wouldn't want to
live here either.

289
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,940
Man, boring. This is boring me!

290
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,770
I finally kick a hero's butt
and I don't get even a single scream.

291
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,900
Now that I think about it,
even if I start living here,

292
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,360
I'll never be famous
if there's no people.

293
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,450
Guess I'll keep going.
Gotta find where they live.

294
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,540
There's somebody.

295
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,830
Another hero?

296
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:29,920
Or a regular guy?

297
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,590
I thought all the humans
cleared out.

298
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,380
If all those monsters
were really around,

299
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,380
there's no way he could live here…

300
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,930
I guess that means
it was just a rumor.

301
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,560
Shoot…

302
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,770
I forgot to buy konbu soup stock.

303
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,730
Master, I saw a lot of konbu
right outside the door.

304
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,940
Oh yeah, I just…

305
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,450
just happened…
to get it for cheap.

306
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,910
Yes, people say that konbu
is good for hair growth,

307
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,790
but since there is
no real scientific proof,

308
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,340
its real effects
are yet to be confirmed.

309
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,130
I did some research,
so I am sure, Master.

310
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,920
For example,
according to this site—

311
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,630
No one said anything about hair!

312
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,970
City Z Investigative Report.

313
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,770
"Nothing noteworthy about
the downtown or residential areas."

314
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,770
â€œDuring our investigation,â€

315
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:33,150
"we encountered a ferocious monster
in the abandoned area,"

316
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,860
"but were unable to
exterminate it."

317
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,770
"We escaped death,"

318
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,940
"but the monster
we encountered disappeared"

319
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,570
"and it is possible that
it still roams the area."

320
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,160
"Also, according to this monster,
there's a rumor that…"

321
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,950
"…powerful monsters
already exist in this area."

322
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,960
Sounds like it was pretty brutal.

323
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,630
A monster?

324
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,880
Yes.

325
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,960
I think I'll pass this time.

326
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:03,760
See? I told you I should have gone!

327
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,800
But…

328
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,760
faced with this,

329
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,770
I'm sure even you would
have had a tough time.

330
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,190
I would have been fine, idiot!

331
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,320
The rumor has not been confirmed,
but the reinforcements saw signs

332
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,740
that point to the existence
of some horrible monstrosity.

333
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,200
Holy crap, what is this?

334
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,870
What kind of monster could
cause such violence?

335
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,920
I'd hate to face off
against this thing.

336
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,590
Hey, what's this?

337
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:41,670
Is it a part of the monster
Spring Mustachio fought?

338
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,800
There may have been
a territorial dispute

339
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,930
between the monsters…

340
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,930
Seems like there's definitely
"something" here.

341
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:54,480
We must continue our investigation
and maintain vigilance over City Z.

342
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,190
Hey, did you hear?

343
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,320
There are monsters living
in the City Z ghost town.

344
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:05,860
Yeah, rumor has it the toughest ones
are secretly plotting something.

345
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:10,490
No, no. Not that rumor.
It's about a more dangerous monster.

346
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,790
What's that?

347
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:12,790
You didn't hear?

348
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,040
I hear the place
has now become terrifying

349
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,330
for both humans and monsters.

350
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:22,840
THE TERRIFYING CITY

351
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:57,930
Master, I filled in the holes
in front of the house.

352
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,520
Oh, thanks!

353
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,940
Also,

354
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,860
MYSTERY MONSTER DEFEATS
CLASS A HEROES
your rank has gone up
from last place, 388th, to 342nd.

355
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,820
Oh? Because of that Panic guy?

356
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,150
He boosted my ranking.

357
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:13,990
So it's been a week now.

358
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,620
Have you done anything?

359
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,870
No, not yet.

360
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,290
I guess it's only been a week.

361
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,500
I'm still ranked last in Class S
for ability…in 17th place.

362
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,050
Sounds like you've still got
a lot of training to do, Genos.

363
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:32,720
But in the public polls,
for popularity I rank number six.

364
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,640
Why?!

365
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,140
"A genius who, at the tender age
of 19, made his debut in Class S."

366
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,390
"He'll do great."

367
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,690
"He's so handsome."

368
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,810
"Love how he refuses to do
media interviews. Very cool."

369
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,020
Those kinds of comments.

370
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,530
You're not embarrassed
to read those out loud?

371
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,990
These comments are based on
impressions from my photo,

372
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,160
not evaluations of me.

373
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,530
I think nothing of them.

374
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,870
Oh yeah?

375
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,120
They continue.

376
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,160
"The Cyborg Prince."

377
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,830
"Behind the steely exterior,
I feel his fragile self."

378
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,370
"Among the top five
handsomest heroes."

379
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,540
Enough already!

380
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,420
NEXT EPISODE:
THE SURPREME DISCIPLE
This is Blizzard.

381
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,010
NEXT EPISODE:
THE SURPREME DISCIPLE
Perhaps you know me better as
"Blizzard from Hell?"

382
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:14,050
Well, I only had a bit part
this episode.

383
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,100
Next on One-Punch Man
is episode 7,

384
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,470
"The Ultimate Disciple."

385
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,060
The Blizzard Bunch will
finally make its appearance.

386
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,980
Miss Blizzard, we're not scheduled
to go on next week!

387
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,940
That can't be right!
