1
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,400
You are one of
the Seafolk, correct?

2
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,530
What if I am?

3
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,160
You must be another soldier…

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,910
I am here to eliminate you.

5
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,140
Was that…

6
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,020
the last of them?

7
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,390
Wow!

8
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,900
– Awesome!
– Amazing!

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,190
They must have been desperate.

10
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,950
Now I'm angry.

11
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,950
I will tear you to shreds.

12
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,950
I let my guard down again.

13
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,950
I never learn.

14
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,080
Saitama…

15
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,090
You're Class C, rank 2.

16
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,920
Are you sure?

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,920
Yeah.

18
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,300
Hurry it up. It's raining.

19
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,600
He burst through every record
during the fitness exam…

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,810
And he worked with some Class S
heroes to destroy that meteor.

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,980
But because he came out of nowhere,
people are saying he's a fraud.&lt;/&gt;

22
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,110
Any other class C hero I'd stop…

23
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,780
This may be our chance to see
how strong he truly is.

24
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,540
Saitama, here's the location.
Head there immediately.

25
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,010
UNYIELDING JUSTICE

26
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,150
Those who can walk,
leave the shelter now!

27
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,900
I cannot promise I will win.

28
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,730
Run, while I keep him busy!

29
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:49,160
None of you monkeys
will escape me!

30
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,150
Lightning Eye!

31
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,280
I can't see…

32
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,490
Machinegun Blows!

33
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,870
You do like combo attacks,
don't you?

34
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,970
You can do it!

35
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:46,970
Quiet!

36
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,180
Now you melt, girl.

37
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,800
If you'd focused on me,

38
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,760
you could have easily dodged
my little ball of acid.

39
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,520
Instead, you chose to
sacrifice yourself to save a runt.

40
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,560
You're a fool, but I give you credit
for giving me a few scratches.

41
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,980
Of course, they've already healed.

42
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,360
Now, die.

43
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,610
Justice Crash!!

44
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,710
The Cyclist for Justice,
Mumen Rider is here!

45
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,880
The top hero in Class C?

46
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,090
D-Don't…

47
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,720
It's Mumen Rider!

48
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,470
Mumen Rider came for us.

49
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,510
But he…

50
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,480
I'm bored already.

51
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:36,790
Oh, my apologies.
I nearly forgot to kill you.

52
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,960
Justice Tackle…

53
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,590
No one expects much—

54
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,980
…from me.

55
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,020
They think a Class C hero
won't be much help.

56
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,990
I know that better than anyone!

57
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,740
I'm not good enough for Class B.

58
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,080
I'm weak. I know that much.

59
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,540
No one has to tell me I have
no chance of beating you.

60
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I already…know that!

61
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,340
What are you babbling about?
Begging for your life?

62
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,430
And yet, I must try.

63
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,520
It's not about winning or losing!

64
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,940
It's about me taking you on
right here, right now!

65
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,740
Enough of your rambling.
Time to finish you off.

66
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,950
You can do it!

67
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,830
Mumen Rider, you can do it!

68
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:07,000
You're the Cyclist for Justice!

69
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,920
Beat that weird monster, beat him!

70
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,430
You can do it!

71
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,970
Yeah, get him!

72
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,510
Beat him up!

73
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:21,020
We're counting on you, Mumen Rider.

74
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,020
– You can do it!
– Beat him!

75
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,810
Good luck!

76
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,540
I think not!

77
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,260
You did fine. Nice fight.

78
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,300
Yet another piece of garbage
washed up on my shore?

79
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,020
H-Hey, Genos!

80
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,480
Are you still alive?!

81
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,020
Mas…ter…

82
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,400
Hang on for a second.

83
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,570
I've gotta pound this Seafreak
or whatever it's called.

84
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,740
I heard that!

85
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:28,790
Impressive. You're still on your feet
after one of my punches.

86
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,130
Clearly you're different
from the rest of this trash.

87
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:35,760
Huh? Your punch was
too weak, that's all.

88
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:39,970
Hey, someone else is over there.
Who is that? A hero?

89
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,560
That head…

90
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,310
I remember it from
the Hero Registry.

91
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,810
I know him! He's a Class C rookie.

92
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,810
I think he's Rank 2.

93
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,100
Class C?

94
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:52,360
So we're still gonna get killed…

95
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,610
But that punch
didn't hurt him at all.

96
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,070
That's your imagination.

97
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,910
You saw how many heroes
were blown away

98
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,580
by that thing's punches, right?

99
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,790
I am the King of the Deep,
Lord of the Seas.

100
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,340
All life on Earth comes from the sea,
as if she were our mother.

101
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,010
In other words, as ruler of the seas,

102
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,380
I am the pinnacle of a pyramid

103
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,930
that includes every living organism
on this world!

104
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,600
– To defy me, means—
– Yeah, yeah, I got it.

105
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,810
It's raining out, so let's do this.

106
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,540
Whaattt!!

107
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,000
Awesome!

108
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,340
That was amazing!

109
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,880
– Thank goodness!
– He did it!

110
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:11,850
Well… that was lame.
I kinda had my hopes up, too.

111
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,740
I'm back with my weapons.

112
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,990
But damn you, Deep Sea King.
You got away.

113
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,510
Hey, what's that?

114
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,550
It is the mail.

115
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:50,310
The post office cannot come here,
so the drone now delivers the mail.

116
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,140
The post office's drone?

117
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,060
No, it belongs to
the Hero Association.

118
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,860
I see.

119
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:03,860
The public sends these to the heroes,
much like fan letters.

120
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,990
Seriously? Are there any for me?

121
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,710
TO C CLASS HERO SAITAMA
– There are.
– Oh! Let's go in and open them!

122
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,880
MR. GENOS,
I'VE BEEN A HUGE FAN OF YOURS
SINCE I FIRST LAID EYES ON YOU!
I THINK YOU ARE A TRUE HERO.
I EVEN JOINED YOUR FAN CLUB!
I'M JUST CRAZY ABOUT YOU!

123
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,810
NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOU,
YOU COWARDLY, CHEATING
BASTARD.

124
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,560
Damn it…
I'll find out who sent it.

125
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,270
Here's a guy with free time.

126
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,860
All it took was one punch!

127
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,950
One punch! Just one!

128
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,990
Is he really Class C?

129
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:49,990
He's too strong!

130
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,620
Or maybe…

131
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,620
…the monster wasn't really that tough?

132
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,040
Yeah, but so many heroes went down.

133
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,920
That just means those heroes
were weaklings.

134
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,390
Maybe… I suppose the monster didn't
look all that tough when he killed it.

135
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:12,560
After all, a Class C hero
took it out with a single punch!

136
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,890
What's that say about
the heroes it beat?

137
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:18,150
They may call themselves
Class A or Class S,

138
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,730
but their titles
don't mean a thing.

139
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:25,570
Hey, enough of that.
They risked their lives for us.

140
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,990
Risked their lives?
Anyone can do that.

141
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,410
But a "hero" has to beat monsters.

142
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,910
It all ended well this time,
so whatever.

143
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:39,420
But it's annoying when heroes
who are really just average Joes

144
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,340
show up and try to save you.

145
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,960
If you're gonna call yourself
a hero, then—

146
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,050
Shut your fat mouth!

147
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,760
Why are you getting mad at me?

148
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,010
The Hero Association gets their funds
from our donations, right?

149
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:55,350
As long as we're paying for it,
they'd better protect us.

150
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,310
The fact of the matter is

151
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,230
that bald guy pretty much took
care of it all by himself.

152
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,110
So all the other heroes
died for nothing.

153
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:06,440
Anyone can come up with a way
to buy a little time.

154
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:10,950
In the end, the other "heroes"
didn't do anything heroic.

155
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:11,910
I said shut up!

156
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,910
We were all saved.
Just leave it at that.

157
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:15,950
Exactly!

158
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,670
Today's my lucky day!

159
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:28,130
The other heroes wore the monster down,
so beating it was kid's play!

160
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,550
Good thing I was late.

161
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,010
I barely did a thing and now
I get all the credit.

162
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,060
Hey, spread the word, all of you!

163
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,980
I'm the one who finished
the monster off!

164
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,940
I'll beat the snot out
of anyone who says

165
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,520
it's only 'cause I got here late!

166
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,070
What's he mean?

167
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,820
The monster was already weak?

168
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,360
Huh…?

169
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,780
Hang on a sec. That's Saitama!

170
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,990
Saitama?

171
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,870
He's the hero from City Z
that everyone calls a cheat.

172
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,620
What? A cheat?

173
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:02,670
He appeared out of nowhere
and climbed the ranks super-fast.

174
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,840
Yeah, pretty fishy.

175
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,300
Hey, you guys!

176
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:08,510
Look after the fallen heroes, okay?

177
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,510
If they die on me,

178
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,800
how am I gonna cash in
on their work?

179
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:13,970
He is a cheat!

180
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,310
Man, that's no fair.

181
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,020
So he's just taking the credit?

182
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,940
Compared to him, the other heroes
seem a little more heroic.

183
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,190
Where would we be now…

184
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,150
if the other heroes hadn't fought?

185
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,820
Yeah, I feel so grateful to them all…

186
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,160
Master Saitama…

187
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,830
Is this really what you want?

188
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,080
Hey, it stopped raining.

189
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,380
If this is the path you choose to walk,
I will not interfere.

190
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:52,300
But in the future, if you are ever
forced into a corner by this,

191
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,300
at that moment, I will—

192
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,310
Hey, there's one more.

193
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,310
TO THE HERO SAITAMA: THANKS!!

194
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,730
Someone's thanking me.

195
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,570
It must be someone you saved.

196
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,440
I see. Any left?

197
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,570
There is one from the Hero Association.

198
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,870
The Association?

199
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,830
Are they firing me?

200
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,450
Well, whatever.

201
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:25,040
What's this? I'm Class C…rank 1?

202
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,090
CITY Z - HERO ASSOCIATION OFFICE

203
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:30,010
So, why'd you call me in?

204
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,260
When you registered with
the Hero Registry,

205
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,010
you were given
the Association handbook.

206
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:41,270
Haven't you read it?
It lists all our rules and regulations.

207
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,980
Yeah, I guess I've got it somewhere.

208
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:48,820
No matter. Congratulations on
attaining rank 1 in Class C.

209
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,820
Hm? Oh, I see.

210
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,820
So you guys are the ones
who decide the hero rankings.

211
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,570
There are more members
on the review board,

212
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,080
but the four of us here today
will be handling your interview.

213
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:01,950
Interview?

214
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:07,540
The top ranking Class C hero is given
the option to be promoted to Class B.

215
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,250
However, if you wish to remain
in Class C, that's fine too.

216
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,260
How about it, Mr. Saitama?

217
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,050
Do you want to move up?

218
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,840
Although if you do, you'll be ranked
at the very bottom again.

219
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,100
Either way's fine,
but I guess I'll try moving up.

220
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:25,230
There'll be no more
weekly quotas that way.

221
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:30,820
Besides, I can't stick to Class C forever
with Genos in Class S.

222
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,030
I see, so you want a promotion.

223
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,240
First, we'll need you to answer
some questions

224
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,450
and undergo a psychiatric analysis.

225
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,620
This Saitama…

226
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,660
He's the one who finished off
the Deep Sea King.

227
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:46,960
What do you think?

228
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,210
Some say he's a fraud…

229
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,340
He set new overall records
in the fitness exam,

230
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,460
so his physical ability is solid.

231
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:59,720
Well, according to rumors,
he cheated on the exams, too.

232
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,760
Rumors are just rumors.

233
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,230
No sense in doubting him now.

234
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:08,390
The bottom line is,
he wants to move up.

235
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,190
Why not let him go for now?

236
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,110
If he's for real,
he'll make it in Class B.

237
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,780
But if he's a fake, he'll soon regret it.

238
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:23,990
He is entering a cruel and callous world.

239
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,910
We'll cross that bridge when we must.

240
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,830
Promotion to Class B?

241
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,790
You interrupted my filming for this?

242
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,130
It's not something that
needs my attention.

243
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:38,010
This is a decision for
the executive committee.

244
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,130
Listen.

245
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:43,470
I only want input on
managing heroes Class A and above,

246
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,970
since they have a strong impact
on society.

247
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,810
As a hero in the same class,

248
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,560
if they're inadequate,
it hurts my image too.

249
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,020
Especially this last incident…

250
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,230
It was beyond inadequate—
it was appalling.

251
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,320
Don't you agree?

252
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,030
Speaking of social impact,
the hero now wanting to move up

253
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:06,830
is the one who finished off
the Deep Sea King.

254
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:23,800
UNKNOWN HEROES SNATCH VICTORY

255
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,980
Why the sour pusses?

256
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,900
That's no way to show off
those cute faces!

257
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,310
You?!

258
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,020
I thought you were in prison!

259
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,530
I escaped just to see you!

260
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,820
Now…it's time for your Angel shots!

261
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,870
You guys! You need your meds!

262
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,830
A "CLASS S" FAILURE!

263
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,010
So I'm Class B now…

264
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,890
Those tests took long enough.

265
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,720
Meh, not like I had to be somewhere.

266
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,520
Something smells good…

267
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,610
Welcome.

268
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,150
Assorted oden, please.

269
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,400
All right.

270
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,990
Want a drink?

271
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,990
If you're not drinking,
let me buy you a plate.

272
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:26,950
Why?

273
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,200
That.

274
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,000
You were at the Association?

275
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,670
Let's celebrate your promotion.

276
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,920
Thanks

277
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,630
for giving me a ride.

278
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,640
Should I walk?

279
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,600
N-No… I can handle it…

280
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,980
Hey, are you scared?

281
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,860
You got separated from
the Class S hero, Genos, right?

282
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,780
The enemy is threat level Demon.

283
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,740
A monster so formidable that even if

284
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,910
the Class S and Class B heroes all
ganged up on him, they'd never win.

285
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,660
So if you wanna run…

286
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,240
Are you Class S too?

287
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,870
No, I'm Class C.

288
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,750
Laugh if you want to.

289
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,130
I'm not laughing.

290
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,470
It sure is tough making those
weekly quotas for us Class C's…

291
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,850
You're a funny guy.

292
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,560
I'm Mumen Rider.
A hero, just like you.

293
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,480
Huh?

294
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,980
Hey! Watch it!

295
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,400
Oh! You're that guy!

296
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,700
I've been looking for you.

297
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,870
I couldn't say everything
in my letter.

298
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:53,910
Oh yeah.

299
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,250
Maybe some mozuku then?

300
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,790
Hey! Give us your best mozuku!

301
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,090
Comin' right up.

302
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,320
It…it approaches!

303
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,650
Madame Shibabawa?
What's wrong?

304
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,700
A violent catastrophe draws near…

305
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:54,030
Madame Shibabawa!
Get a hold of yourself!

306
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,870
This is the end!

307
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,580
The Earth is doomed!

308
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,090
NEXT EPISODE:
UNPARALLELED PERIL
Eh? What is this place?

309
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,880
NEXT EPISODE:
UNPARALLELED PERIL
I am the Deep Sea King!

310
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,340
If I made one misstep,
it was not fighting the battle at sea.

311
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,550
An away game!

312
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,180
If we'd fought at sea,
things would be different!

313
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:21,430
Next time on One-Punch Man:
Episode 10, "Unparalleled Peril."

314
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,020
Really? There's something even more
dangerous than me?
