1
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,080
What could be the cause of the massive
mosquito outbreak this year?

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,170
We ask Mr. Kafetch,

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,040
a mosquito expert who has written
several books on the subject.

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,580
Thank you for having me.

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,880
Well, let me come right to the point.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,080
These mosquitos belong
to an entirely new species.

7
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,790
Therefore, I know nothing about them.

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:24,960
Get out!

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,830
Ah, excuse me.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,420
Now, let's take a look at the areas

11
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,670
- Man, City Z's in their path.
- likely to be hit hardest by the outbreak.

12
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,000
Now we've got a mosquito outbreak?

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,790
We interrupt this program
for breaking news.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,080
A large swarm of mosquitos
has been sighted in City Z.

15
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,500
Mummified remains of attacked
farm animals have also been found.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,830
If you encounter a swarm of mosquitos,
flee immediately.

17
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:47,000
This is an emergency evacuation warning.
Threat level: Demon.

18
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:53,130
No resident is to go outside
under any circumstances.

19
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,830
I repeat, no City Z resident
is to go outside...

20
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,500
Acquiring target.

21
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,000
THE LONE CYBORG

22
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,460
Thanks to that warning,
they're all empty!

23
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,830
Like someone's gonna die
from a mosquito bite.

24
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,380
What's losing
a little blood if I get all this?

25
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,420
The wind...?

26
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,000
What the--?!

27
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,130
Come on, you guys.
That wasn't nearly enough.

28
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,080
Go get some more for me!

29
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,580
Target acquired.

30
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,040
I see.

31
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,330
You make them suck the blood,
then take it all for yourself.

32
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:04,040
You must be controlling the mosquitos
via some sort of signal.

33
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,080
That would explain
their mysterious behavior.

34
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,670
So if I were to get rid of you,
the leader,

35
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,000
would the swarm disperse too?

36
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,130
Our next meal is here.
Go drain him dry.

37
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,210
Incinerate.

38
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,830
I am about to eliminate you.

39
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,670
Stay where you are.

40
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,170
You, eliminate me?

41
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,330
Go on and try!

42
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,040
Got you.

43
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,790
Damn...mosquitos!!

44
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,790
Incinerate.

45
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,630
Maybe a leg next?

46
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,670
Wait, where are my legs?

47
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,210
Impossible.

48
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,630
You cannot escape from me.

49
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,040
What the hell is that guy?

50
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,080
He's gonna get me
if I don't do something.

51
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,080
The townspeople may
all be hiding,

52
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,040
but there are plenty
of animals around.

53
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,250
Come here, little ones.

54
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,540
Empty all your stored juices into me!

55
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:41,960
So many.

56
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:46,960
If she's been collecting blood
from the whole town and beyond,

57
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:50,750
then it may not simply be
a food source for her.

58
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,170
I should put an end to this
as soon as possible.

59
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,710
Get back here, dammit!

60
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,960
You and I aren't done yet!

61
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,290
What's with this guy?

62
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,080
It's in my mouth!
Pft! Pft! You little--!

63
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,210
Huh?

64
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,750
What's that squirming over there?

65
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,130
It's...mosquitoes?!

66
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,170
You over there.

67
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,460
Evacuate now.

68
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,460
That swarm is conscious.

69
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,000
If it senses you,
it will immediately attack.

70
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,080
Seriously?

71
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,670
That's bad. I gotta get--

72
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:02,460
Since you spoke, I thought you would have
at least human-level intelligence.

73
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,170
But you were just a bug.

74
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,130
You brought all the mosquitos together
into one, easy-to-burn swarm.

75
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,130
When I spotted you,

76
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:15,080
I confirmed there were
no living beings within 500 meters,

77
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,880
so I should have been free to fire away.

78
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,670
Wait, that guy might have--

79
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:24,000
Man, you saved me.
You're amazing.

80
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,460
What was that just now?
You totally made them bug out!

81
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,540
Ba-dum-dum-tsh.

82
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:34,040
Oh, I was just trying to make a joke
about the mosquitos being bugs, and...

83
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,040
Idiot!

84
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,080
I no longer need the tiny ones.

85
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,710
I mean,

86
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,920
look...

87
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,750
how strong I've become!!

88
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,080
Can't your punches
kill a little mosquito?

89
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,830
Weakling!

90
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,130
I see.

91
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,630
The more blood she consumes,
the more powerful she becomes.

92
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,330
I think I'll have your head next!

93
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:37,040
I let my guard down.
There's no chance of winning.

94
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,380
All I can do is self-destruct.

95
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,040
Forgive me, Doctor...

96
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,960
Mosquitos...suck!

97
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,670
Hold on!

98
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,250
Please tell me your name!

99
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,420
Oh. It's Saitama.

100
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,960
I'd like to be your disciple.

101
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,170
Oh, okay.

102
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,170
Huh?

103
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,130
Sensei!

104
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,170
You really showed up.

105
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,000
Uh...

106
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,130
It's "Genos," Saitama-sensei.

107
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,170
Can you not call me sensei?

108
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,000
Master!

109
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,460
Not Master either!

110
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,880
Go on home after your drink.

111
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,040
I'm not looking for disciples.

112
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,960
Wait--you're back in one piece?

113
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,880
Yes, my body is mostly mechanical.

114
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,580
As long as there are parts,
repairs are quick.

115
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,040
You're an odd one.

116
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,170
What kind of parts
do you use, Master?

117
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,250
Don't use any.

118
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,210
Then what about the
skin-colored armor on your head?

119
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,790
Yeah, that's my skin.

120
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,000
But that would mean you're bald
despite being so young.

121
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,540
So I'm bald--what's your problem?!

122
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,000
Me? You'll listen to my problems?

123
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,880
No thanks, I'm good.

124
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,790
Actually, four years ago, when I was 15,
I was still a real human being.

125
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,290
Did you hear what I just said?

126
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,540
Although we had to pinch pennies,

127
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,920
my family and I lived
a peaceful and fairly happy life.

128
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:48,460
But one day, a crazy cyborg went out of
control and attacked our town.

129
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,460
The insane cyborg...

130
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,710
Most likely, a failed body modification
generated an irregularity in his brain.

131
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,040
He destroyed everything in sight.

132
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,460
Parks, schools, buildings, my house...

133
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,250
He even took my family's lives.

134
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,250
Miraculously I survived,
but being only a weak 15-year-old,

135
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,420
I was alone and at the end of my strength
in a ruined town.

136
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,540
That's when Doctor Kuseno happened
to pass through.

137
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,710
Doctor Kuseno, a scientist for justice,

138
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,380
was on a mission to stop the destruction
caused by the rampaging cyborg.

139
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,380
I asked Doctor Kuseno to perform
body modification surgery on me.

140
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,880
That's how I was reborn as a cyborg
who fights for justice.

141
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,710
I promised Doctor Kuseno that one day
I would terminate the evil cyborg.

142
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,040
I see--

143
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,080
It's been four years since that day.

144
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:42,170
I'm now 19 and I've been wandering
from town to town eliminating evil.

145
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,040
The number of monsters and criminal
organizations I have destroyed

146
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,460
are too many to count.

147
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:49,380
But I have been unable to find any clues
about the insane cyborg

148
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,710
and have become increasingly
frustrated and restless.

149
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,000
I find myself chasing a virtual image
of that cyborg

150
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,170
whenever I square off against
my enemies.

151
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,080
Then last week, when that mosquito
monster appeared,

152
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,040
I let my concentration slip.

153
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,670
I was convinced I could not lose to anything
but the rampaging cyborg,

154
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,380
so I neglected to even analyze the data
on my opponent and rushed to confront her.

155
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,960
The result, as you know,

156
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,380
was that an opponent
with immense strength bested me.

157
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,630
If you, Master Saitama,
had not been in the area,

158
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,380
I would have undoubtedly
been destroyed.

159
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,080
Master, you saved my life.

160
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,250
My life that was once saved by
Doctor Kuseno

161
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,670
has now been saved again by you,
Master Saitama.

162
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,830
I feel the weight of that responsibility.

163
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,630
I must not die before
destroying that cyborg.

164
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,330
And to do that, I must continue
fighting evil as a righteous cyborg

165
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,290
until he appears before me one day.

166
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,000
I need to get stronger.

167
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,290
Last week,
when I saw your punch,

168
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,920
I knew I had to study under you
as your disciple.

169
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,500
If only I could be
as strong as you, Master Saitama!

170
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,000
I have an old enemy to defeat,

171
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,710
and the battle is not for me only.

172
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,250
It's for my hometown,
and for Doctor Kuseno too.

173
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,290
I realize I am still inexperienced.

174
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,540
But right now,
I need enormous power

175
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,420
so I can eradicate
the greatest of evils!

176
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,500
Doctor Kuseno is--

177
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:02,170
Enough, you idiot!
Shorten it to 20 words or less!

178
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,830
Mosquito Girl was defeated?

179
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,960
With one punch, you say?

180
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,630
Well, she was merely
a prototype, after all.

181
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,170
Why is he naked?

182
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,420
Unknown.

183
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,000
Well, whatever.

184
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,460
He'll make an excellent specimen.

185
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,000
We shall study his physiology--
by force if necessary.

186
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,380
Send a messenger
and invite him here,

187
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,630
to our "House of Evolution."

188
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,130
Master, here's the short version:

189
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,500
Please teach me the way to become
strong like you.

190
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,250
- Genos...
- Yes!

191
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,210
How old are you?

192
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,210
19.

193
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,670
So young...

194
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,170
I'm sure you'll surpass me in no time.

195
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,880
Do you mean that?

196
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,580
I'm 25 now, but I was 22
when I started training in the summer.

197
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,210
Sure, I'll teach you.

198
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,290
But it won't be easy.
Can you handle it?

199
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,210
Yes, sir!!

200
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,130
Object approaching at high speed--
It's here!

201
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:14,630
What?

202
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,080
My name is...huh?

203
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,540
Pay for my ceiling!

204
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,500
So...

205
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,380
Hm?

206
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,080
It seems our advance agent,
Kamakyuri, is down.

207
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,170
I can't sense him
with my telepathy anymore.

208
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:36,540
What? Wasn't he one of
our stronger guys?

209
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,790
There are two more outside.

210
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,080
Master, leave them to me!

211
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,750
Don't bust people's ceilings!

212
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,080
Oh, never mind.

213
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,380
Can't you guys just
come through the door?

214
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:55,710
M-Master!

215
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,500
No, I'm fine.

216
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,250
I kinda feel like a...bamboo shoot.

217
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,130
Elevated energy levels detected.

218
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,080
A cyborg?

219
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,540
Could it be...?

220
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,790
You are not the target.

221
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,790
What's going on? I can't see.

222
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,170
You are in the way!

223
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,330
I have a few questions for you.

224
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,380
It would appear you're in
what they call a "tight spot."

225
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,830
Well done, Ground Dragon!

226
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,040
GROUND DRAGON

227
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,920
It complicates things
if they put up a fight.

228
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,170
Master!

229
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,210
You dare look away?

230
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,880
Quite courageous!

231
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:16,420
I am the pinnacle of
the House of Evolution's science.

232
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,630
I am Armored Gorilla.

233
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:21,330
Your attacks have no effect.

234
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,130
The "House of Evolution"?

235
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,170
What does it want with my master?

236
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,790
It is none of your business.

237
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,630
And it is our rule that any who
oppose us be eliminated without fail.

238
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,500
I must destroy you.

239
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,460
Hey, jerk-off!

240
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,290
What's with that look?

241
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Being underground keeps you cool,

242
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,080
but at the same time,
it's nice and warm.

243
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,630
I'm sleepy. Could you get lost?

244
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,670
I see I need to
teach you your place.

245
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,250
Listen up! I'm gonna slice
your eyes out with these!

246
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,000
Then we'll see if you resist!

247
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,130
The Beast King never
lets anyone off easy.

248
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,710
Well, enough fooling around.

249
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,960
If you wanna apologize,
now's your chance.

250
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,580
You guys smashed my ceiling!

251
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,380
Humph. Fine.

252
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,500
Then behold the true power

253
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,960
- Aw man...
- of the Beast--

254
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,250
I got dirt in my special place.

255
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,460
Hey, are you listening?

256
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,960
Let me just shake this out.

257
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,920
You done?

258
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,210
One sec.

259
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,670
I'm done.

260
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:53,920
Okay, then behold the true power
of the Beast King!

261
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,210
Lion Slash!

262
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,080
You okay, Frog Man--

263
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,040
Outta the way, pissants!

264
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:11,250
Such is the law of the jungle!

265
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,210
And you're next!

266
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,960
Wait! Don't kill him yet!

267
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,630
Lion Slash: Meteor Power Shower!!

268
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,420
Consecutive...

269
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,130
Normal Punches.

270
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,670
Oh.

271
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,210
N-No one told me
he'd be like that!

272
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,080
It's best we retreat now and regroup...

273
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,170
Found you!

274
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,080
No waayyy!

275
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,380
Huh?

276
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:35,080
Answer the question or be eliminated.

277
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,130
Your choice.

278
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,210
It is you who will be eliminated.

279
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,500
You fool.

280
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:44,670
I am the third most powerful
fighter in the "House of Evolution."

281
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,580
At your power level,

282
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:50,170
you will never beat the Beast King,
the second most powerful.

283
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,290
You will be destroyed.

284
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,170
Is this who you mean?

285
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,790
Apparently so.

286
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,000
Look, I'm really sorry.

287
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,420
I'll tell you everything,
just don't kill me!

288
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,380
What the--?
What happened to your robot voice?

289
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,580
Sorry, I was just trying
to sound cool.

290
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,670
What do you mean?
The hit team wiped out?

291
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,540
- How did this happen?
- Wait, don't jump to conclusions yet.

292
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,080
- It may be a mistake.
- Verify the report immediately!

293
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,170
- Right away.
- Be careful!

294
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,000
What's all the commotion?

295
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,500
NEXT EPISODE:
THE OBSESSIVE SCIENTIST
Okay, time for Mosquito Girl's
episode preview!

296
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:13,000
Next week's story will be about
my birthplace.

297
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:16,960
I was born--what?!
Time's up already?!

298
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,330
Oh, all right.

299
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,790
The next episode of One-Punch Man
is episode 3, "The Obsessive Scientist."

300
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,540
Scientist, huh? Who could that be?
