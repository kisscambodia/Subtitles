1
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,110
Humans!

2
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,900
If you wish not for annihilation,
take heed!

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,780
I bear a message from the depths!

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,880
You will surrender the surface to us,
the Clan of the Seafolk!

5
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,590
Thereafter you shall become
our nourishment, human scum—

6
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,770
Nice head! Are you related to
an octopus by any chance?

7
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,900
I heard it was that same guy again.

8
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,940
What was his name?

9
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,820
I forget, but he's super-strong.

10
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,660
HE TAKES EVERY OPPONENT
OUT WITH A SINGLE PUNCH.

11
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,670
BUT PEOPLE SAY
HE STEALS OTHERS' CREDIT.

12
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,670
I MEAN, HE'S CLASS C.

13
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,420
Class C?

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,000
Never seen him before.

15
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,170
I've got to keep up.

16
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,910
THE DEEP SEA KING

17
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:41,280
Help! Somebody!

18
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,330
We, the Clan of the Seafolk,
now rule the surface!

19
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,420
It is useless to resist!

20
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,340
You'll pay for that, human!

21
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,300
The Class A hero Stinger,

22
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,930
rising in popularity and currently
11th in the rankings, is here to help.

23
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,810
At your service, everyone!

24
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:05,930
It's Stinger!

25
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:06,980
We're saved!

26
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,140
Go for it!

27
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,900
Well now…

28
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:15,190
Anyone who needs a new blowhole
drilled into their torso, step right up!

29
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,620
Master…

30
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,210
You have moved up to
rank 2 in Class C.

31
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,130
You are on the verge of
entering Class B!

32
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,250
Class B, huh?

33
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,760
That means I won't have any more
weekly hero quotas, right?

34
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,880
Correct.

35
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,640
Oh, excuse me…

36
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:05,890
Hello?

37
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,850
City J? It is a bit far.

38
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,560
Are there no
competent heroes nearby?

39
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,020
Busy guy…

40
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:14,980
Master!

41
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,940
The monster you defeated
on your way home the other day

42
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,230
called itself one of
the "Seafolk," right?

43
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:21,820
I forget.

44
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,240
Several monsters calling themselves
the "Clan of the Seafolk"

45
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,950
have appeared in City J and
are attacking anyone in sight.

46
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:33,460
A Class A hero fighting them
all alone and on the brink of defeat.

47
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:38,290
His extreme fatigue
and pain are apparent

48
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,590
A prompt response from
the Hero Association

49
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,800
is desperately needed.

50
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,050
Hang on!

51
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,340
The threat level is Tiger.

52
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,300
All citizens are asked to
stay out of the area.

53
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,100
You've got spunk,
you slimy bastards.

54
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,150
My beloved Bamboo Shoot here

55
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,820
is happy to be battling enemies
with some grit for a change.

56
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,150
But it's time to end this.

57
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,030
You can quit your boasting, human!

58
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,320
Your foolish fan club has run off.

59
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,040
But your death will not be easy.

60
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,790
For the taking of our brothers' lives,
long will we cause you to suffer.

61
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,290
Four fish to go!

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,300
It's a lot easier
without an audience!

63
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,630
Sing, Bamboo Shoot!

64
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,930
Gigantic Drill Stinger
Quadruple Thrust!

65
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,350
I did it…

66
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,190
I did it!

67
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,730
These monsters were probably
a God-level threat…

68
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,520
and I defeated them all by my—

69
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,400
You know,
when something's so annoying,

70
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,360
it is a pleasure to watch it die.

71
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,290
How much farther is City J?

72
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,080
We are almost there.

73
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,830
But I am getting no readings.

74
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,460
I will scout ahead.

75
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,960
Once I have confirmed their location,
I will let you know.

76
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,050
Oh…hey!

77
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,680
This is an announcement
from the Hero Association.

78
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,010
The threat level is Tiger.

79
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:18,140
All citizens,
please stay clear of the area.

80
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,940
CITY A - HERO ASSOCIATION HQ

81
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,850
Was the warning issued?

82
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,020
The request just went out.

83
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,280
We'll need to update it
and re-issue.

84
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,070
What do you mean?

85
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,240
Stinger is down.

86
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,990
Mumen Rider here. I'm heading in.

87
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,500
Give me the location.

88
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,040
All lines are busy at this time—

89
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,960
– Where are they?
– Hey, best forget it!

90
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,050
Class C heroes
can't handle this one.

91
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,380
– Huh?
– The word just came down.

92
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,300
Emergency evacuation warning.

93
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,930
The threat level has been
raised from Tiger to Demon.

94
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,930
– All residents of City J,
– See what I mean?

95
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,440
please evacuate immediately.

96
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,230
Hey!

97
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:05,820
I repeat. All residents of City J,
please evacuate immediately.

98
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,030
Evacuate?

99
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,650
How foolish.

100
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,120
As if I'd allow even one
of these apes to escape.

101
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,250
So that's the one that got Stinger…

102
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,580
But he's the last of 'em.

103
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,460
Should I wait for backup?

104
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,300
If it's one-on-one, maybe I can—

105
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,350
That smarts.

106
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,060
Why would you do this?

107
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,390
Dammit, how'd he get behind me?

108
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,810
I was so surprised my voice
went all funky.

109
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,810
Plus, my gunpowder-charged
lightning kick had zero effect!

110
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,900
I can't win.

111
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,530
Who are you?

112
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,780
I am…

113
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,700
Lightning Max, the hero…

114
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,030
Fight me.

115
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,830
Fight you? Of course.

116
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,330
I'll run for it as soon as—

117
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,630
What happened?

118
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,550
I can't feel my body…

119
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:15,890
Dammit.

120
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,680
You arrogant…

121
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:23,560
Lightning Flying Backwards
Roundhouse Kick!

122
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,080
Class S hero,

123
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,000
Puri-puri Prisoner.

124
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,840
I escaped from prison…
just to see you!

125
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,050
Well, well.

126
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,800
A hero serving time in prison?

127
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,390
I tagged along and
was able to escape too.

128
00:08:58,930 --> 00:08:59,930
My thanks.

129
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,140
Prisoner number 4188, Sonic, right?

130
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,230
Surprised I know?

131
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,060
You see, I check up on
all the boys who catch my eye.

132
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:14,440
I'm serving a life sentence because
I can't resist attacking beautiful men.

133
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,070
Oh my.

134
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,530
More soldiers come for me?

135
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,410
Goodness!

136
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,960
I feel the strength about to
erupt out of him!

137
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,750
Sonic, dear, you hang back.

138
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,010
Class A rank 11, sweet Stinger.

139
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,970
Class A rank 20, Lighting Max.

140
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,680
I fancied them both.

141
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,100
And yet you ruined them!

142
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,850
Now that Genos has passed me,
I am the lowest in rank…

143
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,560
but I am still Class S!

144
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,480
I am unlike either of them.

145
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,570
I'll begin at half-power,
to gauge how much you can take.

146
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:07,040
You made me rip the hand-knit
sweater my boyfriend made!

147
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:13,500
I will never, ever forgive you!

148
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,050
A delectable slab of meat,
quite prime.

149
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,340
My appetite's up!

150
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,850
Huh?

151
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,310
Oh my…

152
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,530
I felt that…

153
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,570
just a little.

154
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,660
I felt that too…a little.

155
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,540
Puri-puri Prisoner is acting tough,
but he's hurting…

156
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,000
So this is what a fight between
a demon-level monster

157
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,750
and a Class S hero looks like?

158
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,670
It's almost comical.

159
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,680
Neither one could defeat me.

160
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,680
Dammit… His punch was stronger
than I expected.

161
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,310
But I must not lose to him.

162
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,690
I can't have any more of my boys
destroyed by this monster…

163
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,360
I have no choice.

164
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,230
I'll have to transform.

165
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,860
Ready…

166
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:19,990
Transform!

167
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,540
Puri-puri Prisoner Angel Style!

168
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,750
He's naked.

169
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,870
And he's definitely no angel.

170
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,790
Nor is he human.

171
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,500
Nor do I want to watch.

172
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,380
I'm out.

173
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:39,550
No one has ever seen my Angel Style
and lived to tell about it.

174
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,930
All the more reason to leave.

175
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,010
Quite unsightly.

176
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,930
Are those…your last words?

177
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,650
Angel Rush!

178
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,370
Elevated energy levels nearby.

179
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,870
That must be it.

180
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,830
Damn it! I have no way
to reach Master!

181
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,540
It cannot be helped.

182
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,100
Done with your combo?

183
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,980
I felt that…a little.

184
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,280
Hear me.

185
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:47,870
The objective of a combination move
is to finish your opponent.

186
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:51,200
Each separate attack must be
delivered with intent to kill.

187
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,000
Like this.

188
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,920
Isn't this fun?

189
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,090
Just who are you?

190
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,430
I am the Deep Sea King.

191
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:13,020
As lord of the Clan of the Seafolk,
this world is mine to rule.

192
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,560
Do you dare defy me too?

193
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,770
You think you have the strength
to rule the surface all alone?

194
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,030
That's pathetic.

195
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:22,860
Oh?

196
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,820
Then I suppose you must die.

197
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,030
That's my line.

198
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:32,120
I would have let you live if you'd
shown me the respect I'm due.

199
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,910
I'm no hero, but I will eliminate you.

200
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,290
The rain…is falling.

201
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,170
Too slow.

202
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,510
Wind Blade Leg!

203
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,350
Deep Sea King,
I see right through your moves.

204
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,890
Are you sure of that?

205
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,020
Once it bites,
my little moray here never lets go!

206
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,360
Let me be clear.

207
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,900
There's no way I'd ever lose to you.

208
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,620
It's useless.

209
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,160
You may have power…

210
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,210
but you're too slow to fight me.

211
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,920
I'm glad, Deep Sea King!

212
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,800
Fighting something like you just
confirms how strong I really am!

213
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,930
You see, my moves are
the fastest and the strongest!

214
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,020
Now what, lost your mind?

215
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,940
He's faster!

216
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,530
Stronger too?!

217
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,400
What happened to him?

218
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,410
He's huge!

219
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,200
The air of the surface
shriveled me up a bit,

220
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,960
but thanks to this rain,
I feel like myself again.

221
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,090
Your attacks don't hurt me…
even a little!

222
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:19,600
At this time,

223
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,730
the whereabouts of the Seafolk
that attacked City J are unknown.

224
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,860
Several heroes
who tried to stop them

225
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,440
have been found
unconscious at the scene

226
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,910
and remain in critical condition.

227
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,490
Of all the times to hit a red light…

228
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,660
Where'd he run off to?

229
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:41,960
Wait, you're…

230
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,000
Class C, rank 2.

231
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,000
You a hero too?

232
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,960
Have you seen Genos?

233
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,170
Genos?

234
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:54,260
Today, as our guest, we have
the top-ranked, Class A superhero

235
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:57,060
who has also been number one
in popularity rankings

236
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,810
for 28 weeks straight.

237
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,100
He's also a successful model,
actor and singer.

238
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:06,560
Let's welcome
the handsome Mr. Amai Mask!

239
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,190
Thank you for having me.

240
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,950
We are currently facing
a threat level of Demon.

241
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,950
How do you assess the situation?

242
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,490
That is a difficult question.

243
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,330
Why is that?

244
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:25,250
I'm only a hero when I confront evil.

245
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,050
The rest of the time, I'm focused on
my career as an artist.

246
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,550
I see.

247
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,180
I'm only here today
to promote my new song.

248
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,890
My apologies.

249
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,930
In that case, let's discuss your song.

250
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,890
Let me just say this.

251
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,690
To assuage the public's fears
and worries,

252
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:50,070
heroes need to be
both tough and strong

253
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:56,660
so that they can defeat evil
with speed, grace, and brilliance.

254
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,780
I find it regrettable that
there were heroes

255
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:02,330
who were completely beaten
by evil this time.

256
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,210
So that no hero ever dies in vain,

257
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,130
I hope each will continue
to train his hardest.

258
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,670
My attacks have no effect.

259
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,970
Could I be lacking in power?

260
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,340
I can't kill him unarmed.

261
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,180
I need to retreat for now
and find a weapon.

262
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,680
Caught you!

263
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,190
Crack crack, snap snap.

264
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,360
Huh?

265
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:30,690
Wait there.

266
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,610
The next time we meet
will be your demise.

267
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,450
No matter.

268
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,910
The small fry can be let go.

269
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,370
Who are you?

270
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,000
What are you doing here?

271
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,380
There were orders to evacuate.

272
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,340
A hero?

273
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,300
If you're after the Deep Sea King,
better forget it.

274
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,550
Deep Sea King?

275
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,390
You heroes could all jump him
at once and still lose.

276
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,560
You're fine at playing make-believe,

277
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,310
but against true power
you don't stand a chance.

278
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,140
You can't protect a thing.

279
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,980
Who was that pervert?

280
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,070
The Seafolk?!

281
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,450
I sense numerous
life signals nearby.

282
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,370
With so many…

283
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,870
The evacuation shelter!

284
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:30,080
Daddy, are the scary monsters
still outside?

285
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:34,750
Don't worry. As long as
we're in this shelter, we're safe.

286
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,590
Besides…if it comes down to it,

287
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,880
I'm sure all of us together
can beat a monster or two.

288
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,260
I sense them…

289
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,520
Yes, so many!

290
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,980
It's coming from...

291
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,100
over there!

292
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,820
Greetings…

293
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,070
and goodbye.

294
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,910
Please wait!

295
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,370
We surrender!

296
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,420
We will comply with
any demands you have.

297
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,420
But please do not attack. I beg you.

298
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,970
I'm only Class C, so I evacuated.
Now I'm trapped.

299
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,930
I'm no hero. I'm a failure…

300
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,550
Surrender?

301
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,020
I've come to kill you.
Your deaths are inevitable!

302
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,310
And as for my demands…

303
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,900
How about I demand you scream
nicely as I slaughter you?

304
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,570
I can't win…

305
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,150
I know it won't amount to much,

306
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,200
but all I can do is buy time for
the Class S heroes to get here.

307
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,660
But look at this monster…

308
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,580
Who am I kidding?

309
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:51,500
I can't buy time just by
talking to him.

310
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,500
I pissed my pants…

311
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,670
I'm pathetic.

312
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,840
I'll fight with you!

313
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,920
Heroes?

314
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,880
There are others in here too?

315
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,050
I may be the lowest ranking at 38,

316
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,810
but I'm still a Class A hero.

317
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:09,930
We can do this.

318
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,310
I-I'm a hero too!

319
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,350
Allback-man is here!

320
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,400
Heroes?

321
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,980
The heroes are here?

322
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:17,980
Heroes!

323
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,110
They'll save us!

324
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,990
I feel better with a Class A around.

325
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,360
Yeah…

326
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:27,990
Two Class C's,
one Class B and one Class A…

327
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,160
We can do it!

328
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:30,450
We can win!

329
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,330
You sure this is the way?

330
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,960
Yes, since residents
are fleeing from this direction,

331
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,550
we'll find monsters further up.

332
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,390
Did you see a butt naked guy
run past?

333
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,340
What?

334
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,550
Maybe he was taking a bath
and was left behind.

335
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,270
I'll check it out.

336
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,850
Go on without me.

337
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,020
Got it!

338
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,150
Mumen Rider here.

339
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,070
Yes, we're on our way.

340
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,190
What! The shelter?

341
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,820
It was the other way!

342
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,920
All right. When I give the signal,
charge him.

343
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,920
One…

344
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,630
Two…

345
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:26,760
That's weird.
I know I saw him…

346
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:42,030
Why so quiet all of a sudden?

347
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,400
Are you one of the Seafolk?

348
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,950
Mumen Rider went in?

349
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,910
Yes. I couldn't stop—

350
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,290
Mumen Rider?!

351
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,830
What's your location?

352
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,710
This is beyond you.

353
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,290
The monster even took out
a Class S hero!

354
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,550
We need to assemble
a subjugation squad.

355
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,670
A Class S hero was defeated?

356
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,920
Who is this?

357
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,090
Where's Mumen Rider?

358
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,010
Stand-up Peddling Mode!

359
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,480
Roar, Justice!

360
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,640
Is this the Hero Association?

361
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,900
Yes. Who are you?

362
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,730
Give me the owner of
that cell phone right now!

363
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,900
This is the hero Saitama.

364
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,820
Saitama?

365
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,500
NEXT EPISODE:
UNYIELDING JUSTICE
Hey, how'd you like
my Gigantic Drill Stinger?

366
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,220
NEXT EPISODE:
UNYIELDING JUSTICE
By the way, I nailed ten
of those Seafolk things!

367
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,630
You're pretty upbeat.

368
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,890
Oh, Lightning Max?

369
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:16,100
I won't ask how many
Seafolk you defeated,

370
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,600
but I'm sure you did great.

371
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,430
Next time on One-Punch Man:
Episode 9,

372
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,600
"Unyielding Justice."

373
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,980
I'm not sure who'll mete it out,

374
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,310
but make sure our sacrifices
weren't in vain!
