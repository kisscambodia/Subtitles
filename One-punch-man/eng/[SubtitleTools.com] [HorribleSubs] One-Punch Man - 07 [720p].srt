1
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,370
But this…

2
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,960
Initiating docking procedures.

3
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,170
Roger.

4
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,180
Elevating from 6 to 9
on the Torino Scale!

5
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,400
CITY A – HERO ASSOCIATION HQ
The course suddenly shifted?

6
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:53,780
I see.

7
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:57,160
Then we will discuss how best
to deal with the situation.

8
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,160
Should I go now?

9
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:01,990
All right.

10
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,830
Master, for some reason
the Hero Association

11
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,080
wants me to come in.

12
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,380
I will be back later.

13
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,460
Okay. Maybe you're getting fired?

14
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,930
THE ULTIMATE DISCIPLE

15
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,530
CITY Z HERO ASSOCIATION BUILDING

16
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,200
Ah, you would be Genos?

17
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,370
My name is Bang. Nice to meet you.

18
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,660
Bang, Class S rank 3,
a.k.a. "Silver Fang."

19
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,210
He possesses true skill.

20
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,960
The Association called me in.

21
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,050
Everyone's at Headquarters.

22
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,010
This little branch office
is empty just now.

23
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,930
Each of the Class S heroes
got the call to come here,

24
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,510
but we're the only ones
who showed up.

25
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:28,810
Why is that?

26
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,230
Too far away,
or perhaps they're busy.

27
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,110
Of course, some of the more cold-blooded
ones simply don't bother.

28
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,190
After all, we're called up only

29
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,450
when there's some impossible problem
they want us to take care of.

30
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,780
Today's no exception.

31
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,370
The threat level is Dragon,
a worst-case scenario.

32
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,040
35 minutes from now,
a huge meteor will strike City Z.

33
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:00,590
They are asking if nearby Class S
heroes can do anything about it.

34
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,170
A meteor?

35
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,010
Apparently,
it suddenly changed paths.

36
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,810
That means the end for us.

37
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,470
The impact will wipe out City Z.

38
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,270
I'm afraid there's nothing
we can do this time.

39
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,110
You too should think about
evacuating with your loved ones.

40
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,070
Do the citizens know?

41
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,280
I was told they would estimate
the impact area

42
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,030
and issue evacuation orders
30 minutes before it hits.

43
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,750
Attention! This is an announcement
from the Hero Association.

44
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,830
People are sure to panic.

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,330
And you, old fellow?

46
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,040
"Old fellow," is it?

47
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,050
Call me Bang.

48
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,380
You are not evacuating?

49
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,050
My dojo has been in my family
for generations.

50
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,470
I cannot abandon it.

51
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,680
"Fist of Flowing Water
Crushing Rock."

52
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,020
Heard of it?

53
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,650
He left…

54
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,940
Emergency evacuation warning.

55
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,030
The threat level is Dragon.

56
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,820
Evacuate immediately.

57
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,200
21 more minutes
until meteor impact.

58
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,080
It's huge…

59
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,460
No way we can escape that.

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,970
So many people have
given up hope of survival.

61
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,180
It is not just City Z
that is in danger.

62
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,260
The neighboring cities will
also sustain damage.

63
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,060
It is too late to evacuate.

64
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,600
I did not expect to be testing
this prototype so soon!

65
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,000
Let me see if an attack from
my incineration cannon at full power

66
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,920
will do the trick.

67
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,750
Master Saitama lives here too.

68
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,260
I cannot possibly
evacuate without him.

69
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,010
Is that…?

70
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,610
You are Bofoi, correct?

71
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,410
And you are the new boy, Genos.

72
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,990
Come to stop the meteor?

73
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,990
Yes.

74
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,120
Class S rank 7.

75
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,910
A hero who uses intense firepower

76
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,420
to obliterate his opponents along
with everything in their vicinity.

77
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,790
Does he also live in City Z?

78
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,500
Or did he rush here,
putting his life at risk?

79
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,760
Bofoi. I need your help.

80
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,010
I refuse.

81
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,010
Why?

82
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,220
I only came to field test
my new weapon.

83
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,560
The meteor is a perfect target.

84
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:57,980
A test?

85
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,230
If that meteor hits,
you too will die.

86
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,770
– I will not.
– What?

87
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:08,030
What you are talking to right now
is a remotely-controlled drone.

88
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,660
Sorry to disappoint you,
but my life's not at stake here.

89
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,030
Also, I am not Bofoi.
I am "Metal Knight."

90
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:19,410
Heroes call each other by
their hero names, not real names.

91
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,870
Everyone knows that.

92
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,170
Looks like it's time to
end our little chat.

93
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,470
All right!

94
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,550
Firing missiles!

95
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,190
Metal Knight?

96
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,570
I cannot fire with his missiles
in the way.

97
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,910
Amazing.

98
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,960
Such destructive power.

99
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,500
This hero is dangerous.

100
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,290
I must be wary.

101
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,430
Not quite potent enough, eh?

102
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,730
33 seconds left until impact.

103
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,230
To fire my incineration cannon
at full power,

104
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,440
I need five seconds to charge it
with my body's energy.

105
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,360
But the target is already close.

106
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,450
And if I do take it out, what then?

107
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,950
The meteor may break apart
and still cause a disaster.

108
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,120
But even before that,

109
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,120
will my weapons
be powerful enough to stop it?

110
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,370
Even Metal Knight's countless
missiles had no effect.

111
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,130
First off, be calm.

112
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,550
I see you've lost composure.

113
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,010
You are far too young
to be worried about failure.

114
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,010
When your back's up against
the wall, just muddle through.

115
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,010
The outcome won't change.

116
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,930
So that's what is best.

117
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,440
Muddling through is best…?

118
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,570
He is right.

119
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,120
If the outcome will not change…

120
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:26,250
then I how can I die
without giving it my all?

121
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,630
Bang, get down!

122
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,420
Oh.

123
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,050
I will no longer think about failure
or repercussions!

124
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,180
I will just pour everything I have…

125
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,010
…into one last shot!

126
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,110
Dammit, it is not working!

127
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,490
No! I think I see the meteor
being pushed back.

128
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,820
Really?

129
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,990
Oh, no. It was just my imagination.

130
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,200
You old fool!

131
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,040
So this…will be my grave.

132
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,550
Nine more seconds.

133
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,140
Get out of here, Bang.

134
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,180
Old man, take care of Genos.

135
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,320
Who…who are you?

136
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,820
I'm a hero.

137
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,830
Master?!

138
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,880
You're not…

139
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,220
gonna fall…

140
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,550
on my town!

141
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,070
He shattered it!

142
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,730
Unbelievable!

143
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,150
But…

144
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,580
It's collapsing…!

145
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,420
It's not just this building.

146
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,750
The destruction is spreading
through the whole city.

147
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,810
Guess that settles that.

148
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,990
THREE DAYS LATER

149
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:05,410
Although City Z was able to
avoid total destruction,

150
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,910
the city was still devastated,

151
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:12,210
with the effects of the meteor
fragments visible everywhere.

152
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,920
If only the Hero Association
had called…

153
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,840
you to help instead of me, Master.

154
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:21,050
If you had worked
with Metal Knight,

155
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,470
the damage
could have been minimized.

156
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,220
But that Metal Knight guy…

157
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,100
wasn't interested
in helping, right?

158
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,060
So stop worrying about it.

159
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,770
I think we kept the damage
to a minimum.

160
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,020
After all, no one died.

161
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:36,810
He is right.

162
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,780
Master's punch killed
the meteor's momentum.

163
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,150
Theoretically, the shockwaves
from the meteor

164
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,070
would have annihilated everything.

165
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,740
Stopping it was nothing
short of a miracle.

166
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,330
I would not be surprised

167
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,000
if people talk about Master
for years to come,

168
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,000
praising him as a man of courage.

169
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,960
But Master has no idea.

170
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,920
Some of the public is even making
him out to be the bad guy

171
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,930
for causing the partial destruction
of City Z.

172
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,970
No, I should not mention it.

173
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,220
By the way,

174
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,020
do you think we moved up
in ranking?

175
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,980
Yes, we did.

176
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,020
I went from Class S rank 17 to 16.

177
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,820
Metal Knight also moved up
from rank 7 to 6.

178
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:25,990
Master, you shot up from
Class C rank 342 to 5.

179
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,950
Number 5?!

180
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,080
From 342 to 5?

181
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,910
What the hell?! That's crazy!

182
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,910
Not at all.

183
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,960
Your performance was worthy
of Class A or even Class S.

184
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,130
After all, it was threat level Dragon.

185
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,670
Yeah?

186
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,130
If there had been no damage,

187
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,550
I am sure you would be
at Class S rank 5.

188
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:52,350
Smashing the meteor alone
was worthy of Class A.

189
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,770
But I think the Hero Association
assumed that

190
00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:00,110
Metal Knight and I played a big role.

191
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,280
By the way,
they always report threat levels

192
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,570
as "demon" or "tiger"
or whatever.

193
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,990
Does all that mean anything?

194
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,570
It does…

195
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,030
Tiger: A crisis threatening
massive loss of life.

196
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,250
Demon: A crisis threatening
to halt the functioning of an entire city,

197
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,120
or its destruction.

198
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,670
Dragon: A crisis threatening
the destruction of multiple cities.

199
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,800
God: A crisis threatening
human extinction.

200
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,920
GUIDE TO THREAT LEVELS
Wow…I had no idea.

201
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,220
I believe heroes often
consider threat levels

202
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,850
when deciding to respond or not.

203
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,890
But I guess
they do not matter to you.

204
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,060
Well, of course not.

205
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,980
If the heroes run away,
who's left to help?

206
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,530
What are you doing?

207
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,700
I must record your words.

208
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,990
Anyway, it wasn't all that much
for such a huge jump in rank…

209
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:56,750
All right.

210
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,040
I'll be out for a bit.

211
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,750
You are going out, Master?

212
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,790
I will come with you.

213
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,250
You stay here.

214
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,920
If something happens,
you'll get all the credit again.

215
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,180
This place has been wrecked…

216
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,230
Oh.

217
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,150
My favorite supermarket
got smashed.

218
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,940
And the crappy apartment building
I got kicked out of is…

219
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,780
Just fine…damn.

220
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,820
Hey.

221
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,160
You cheating bastard.

222
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,120
Uh…who are you?

223
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,160
You know damn well
I'm Tank-top Tiger!

224
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,920
Brother!

225
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,710
It's that guy!

226
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,000
Seriously, who is this guy?

227
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,970
You called me, little bro?

228
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:53,720
Brother!

229
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,850
The hero Tank-top
Black Hole…

230
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:57,970
is here!

231
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,020
So you're the fraud who
takes credit for work done

232
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,400
by Class S heroes in order
to jump the rankings?

233
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,440
What the—?

234
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,650
No one could move up
to number five so quickly

235
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:08,940
without cheating.

236
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,070
What do you guys want?

237
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,490
Huh? Isn't that obvious?

238
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,120
To beat you up so bad…

239
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,280
- you'll never be able to—
- Hang on, little bro.

240
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,160
Bastards like him don't learn
from that kind of lesson.

241
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,000
Let's make him really pay…

242
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:29,050
with the most brutal method there is.

243
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,920
Are you the one?!

244
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:36,680
The jerk-off responsible
for destroying this city?!

245
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,810
I get it!

246
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,230
There are tons of people in this city
who are angry with him.

247
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,020
Unbelievable!

248
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,980
How can you show your face?!

249
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,400
I see what he's doing.

250
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,610
He's going to use their anger…

251
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,360
Do you feel nothing at
the sight of this devastation?

252
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,030
…to break his spirit!

253
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,290
You're gloating,

254
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,000
thinking you've actually
saved these people!

255
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,790
Why else would you be walking around
so shamelessly?

256
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,790
Thanks to your screw up,

257
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,380
these citizens have nowhere to go!

258
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,090
If you were gonna fail this hard,
why'd you butt in?!

259
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:19,180
The other heroes would
have done a way better job!

260
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,060
And yet you still wanna play hero,

261
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,220
even after causing such
a huge disaster?

262
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,980
Look at this place!

263
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,810
All this destruction is your doing!

264
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:30,980
That's right.

265
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,490
I-It's your fault!

266
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,400
They took the bait.

267
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,450
You hear that?

268
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,280
The heart-wrenching cry
of someone who lost his home!

269
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:47,040
Look at them all, victims of
your thoughtless actions!

270
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,420
That's right!

271
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,960
Yeah, you tell him!

272
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,630
Haven't you even thought
to take responsibility?

273
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,710
Yeah!

274
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,090
You're inhuman!

275
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,090
Give up being a hero!

276
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:01,050
Give it up! Give it up! Give it up!

277
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,350
Give it up!

278
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,560
- Give it up!
- Give it up!

279
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,680
Give it up!

280
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:06,770
Give it up!

281
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,730
- Give it up!
- Go on, get outta here!

282
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:09,770
- Give it up!
- Get lost!

283
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:10,940
- Give it up!
- Beat it!

284
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,980
- Give it up!
- Scram!

285
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,900
- Give it up! Give it up!
- Give it up! Give it up!

286
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,070
- Give it up! Give it up! Give it up!
- Give it up! Give it up! Give it up!

287
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:20,280
- Give it up! Give it up! Give it up!
- Give it up! Give it up! Give it up!

288
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,540
- Give it up! Give it up! Give it up!
- Give it up! Give it up! Give it up!

289
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,700
- Give it up! Give it up! Give it up!
- Give it up! Give it up! Give it up!

290
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,830
- Give it up! Give it up!
- Give it up! Give it up!

291
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,960
We got him.

292
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,920
His pride should be
shattered by now.

293
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,840
That's what he gets for cheating…

294
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:35,920
That idiot!

295
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,680
CITY Z FORUM – IS IT TRUE
A CLASS C HERO
DESTROYED THE TOWN?

296
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:50,440
- Give it up! Give it up! Give it up!
- Give it up! Give it up! Give it up!

297
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,560
- Give it up! Give it up!
- Give it up! Give it up!

298
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:55,020
Is this what you call
mob mentality?

299
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,780
They're all chanting in unison.

300
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,910
Give it up! Give it up! Give it up!

301
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,200
Saitama…

302
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:06,950
Without a doubt,
you saved this city.

303
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,870
Yet look how the city treats you.

304
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,790
This is reality, though.

305
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:16,630
You're strong, the strongest man
I've ever seen.

306
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:19,720
That's why I refrain
from saying anything.

307
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,890
I'd hate to see you rotting away
in this industry.

308
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,060
Resigning is also an option.

309
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,730
Time to finish him off!

310
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:30,850
Hey!

311
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,980
He's getting ready to fight!

312
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,650
Huh? What are you talking—

313
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:35,650
No way!

314
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,690
You're gonna take out
your frustration

315
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:41,150
on these people here,
just like you destroyed their city?!

316
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,450
Do you just kill everyone
you don't like?

317
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,160
I won't let you do that!

318
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,910
We, the Tank-top Brothers,
will not stand by

319
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,040
and let you resort to violence!

320
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:52,920
If you're a hero,
then fight us fair and square!

321
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,040
So they're out to crush a rookie

322
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,380
and perform a publicity stunt
at the same time.

323
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,470
I'd say they've gotten a little greedy.

324
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,600
No wonder they can't rise
above Class B.

325
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:06,970
Yeah!

326
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,060
Go, Tank-top!

327
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:08,970
Do it!

328
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,150
Tank-top Tiger,
who fights like a true tiger, and…

329
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,360
Tank-top Black Hole,

330
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,610
who crushes all
with a grip strength of 2,800 psi!

331
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:25,200
We brothers will punish all
who stray from the path of the hero!

332
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:29,490
Huh?

333
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:31,910
Damn it!

334
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,870
I'll rip you apart!

335
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,250
I give up! I give up!

336
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,010
You're crushing my hand!

337
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:41,630
Huh?

338
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,340
You're kidding, right?

339
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:46,470
I give up for real.
I'm sorry!

340
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:49,140
I'm sorry for lying!

341
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,180
No, you weren't lying.

342
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,520
I'm the one who smashed
the meteor!

343
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,850
Anyone with a complaint,
let's hear it.

344
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,020
Speak up!

345
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,360
Because of you,
my brand new car was—

346
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,740
You can shut up!

347
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,410
Why would I give a crap
about your problems?

348
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,990
Tell it to the meteor, jackass!

349
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,410
Listen up!

350
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:16,330
I don't do this hero-thing
for admiration!

351
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,090
I do it because I want to!

352
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,000
So if you wanna blame me,
go ahead!

353
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,010
You baldies!

354
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,260
You're the baldy…

355
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,470
What'd you say?!

356
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:26,930
Master.

357
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,140
Oh, it's you, Genos.

358
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:30,810
Hang on.

359
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:31,600
These guys—

360
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,970
Let's go home,

361
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,350
Master.

362
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,150
Oh yeah?

363
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,490
Dammit. That guy's face
is burned into my brain.

364
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,320
I'm gonna remember this.

365
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,120
Master.

366
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:55,750
I have never met any person
as incredible as you, Master Saitama.

367
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,750
What brought that on?

368
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,960
You're creeping me out.

369
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,090
Even if the public
doesn't appreciate you,

370
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,550
I will still follow you.

371
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,140
You don't have to
butter me up. Really.

372
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,530
I heard there's some amazing hero
in Class C right now.

373
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:52,660
Class C?

374
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,070
The guy who says
he smashed the meteor, right?

375
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,450
That's just a rumor.

376
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:00,040
Going after weak guys,
then calling yourself a hero?

377
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,290
Just shows that there's no hero
you can really count on.

378
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,050
My name is Bofoi.
NEXT EPISODE: THE DEEP SEA KING

379
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:12,800
You all may know me better
as Metal Knight.
NEXT EPISODE: THE DEEP SEA KING

380
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:16,100
Next time on One-Punch Man
episode 8,

381
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,680
"The Deep Sea King."

382
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:22,100
Oh, the king of the sea, eh?
Pretty cocky.

383
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,060
Wonder what he's like…
