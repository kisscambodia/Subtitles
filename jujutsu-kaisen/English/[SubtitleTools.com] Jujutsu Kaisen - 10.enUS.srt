Super Scary Movie 7

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,600
What? The Super Scary Movie series went up to 5?

6
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:13,360
Up to 7, actually.

7
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,160
For real?

8
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,890
The seventh one must be really out there.

9
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,800
It became a completely different thing by 7.

10
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,950
It's not even a parody movie anymore.

11
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,270
Then what kind of movie is it?

12
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,530
Convoluted sitcom plus
lineage horror, I suppose?

13
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,670
What the heck?

14
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,940
By a total fluke, and the grandchild of
the main character from 1 ends up living

15
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,570
in a shared house with the
grandchild of the culprit from 2

16
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,350
and the grandchild of the
first person who died in 3,

17
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,960
but it turns out it's a haunted house,
so they call in a spirit medium.

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,770
That's the story.

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,980
Sounds boring.

20
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,050
It bored me to death.

21
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,900
Who'd watch something like that?

22
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,560
What's interesting, though,
is that the guy from 5 and 6—

23
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,430
Huh?

24
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,160
What are you doing here?

25
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,660
Didn't I tell you not to use this room
because we're making it our club room now?

26
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,370
B-But you haven't been using it lately,
so I thought it was fine now.

27
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,110
So?

28
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,850
So, well, um...

29
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,920
Just get out of here already,
you cockroaches!

30
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,750
L-Let's go, Yoshino.

31
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,400
Next time you use it, we'll send you flying!

32
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,310
Oh, score!

33
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,430
Hey, what are you doing?!

34
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:40,970
What?

35
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,530
I'm taking it home.

36
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:45,770
Huh?

37
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,600
Move your foot.

38
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,820
Hey, stop it...

39
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,230
I'm taking this home.

40
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,860
So could you move your foot?

41
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,000
Shit!

42
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,690
Close the door.

43
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,400
Roger.

Episode 10: Idle Transfiguration

47
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,380
I wonder if the first person to say
"the opposite of fondness is indifference"

48
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,520
went to hell like they should have.

49
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,880
It's just not possible that interacting
maliciously with others

50
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,980
could be more proper than leaving them alone.

51
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,570
"The opposite of fondness is hate."

52
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,290
Japanese people love that.

53
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,520
They like to gloat over
complicating a simple answer.

54
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,110
The man who coined that
phrase wasn't Japanese.

55
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,420
I'm talking about the mistaken translation.

56
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,800
The original phrase,
spoken by some foreigner,

57
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,520
was "the opposite of love
is indifference," right?

58
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:20,990
There are various definitions of "love,"
so "indifference" works as an antonym there.

59
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,790
That's true.

60
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,110
But we generally don't use
"love" very much, right?

61
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,410
That's why, in this country,

62
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,610
it got changed to "fondness" at some point.

63
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:37,100
That version spread without any thought
as to whether the opposing definitions

64
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,440
of "love" and "indifference" still held true.

65
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,240
Everyone likes a little wordplay.

66
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,500
After all, humans can't live
without making up excuses.

67
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,210
What's this?

68
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,090
An experiment to see just how
large I can make a single human.

69
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:09,130
On that one, I tried to see
how small I could make one.

70
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,780
This is...

71
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,580
a human?

72
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,010
Are you used to corpses, Junpei?

73
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,600
I don't know.

74
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:25,750
If this was my mother, I might lose control

75
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,680
and end up hating you.

76
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,580
But I already know how
repulsive humans can be.

77
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,480
That's why I don't expect
anything from other people,

78
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,960
nor do I think much of it when
someone I don't know dies.

79
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,820
Indifference is the virtue
people ought to strive for.

80
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:54,480
And despite that, you want revenge.

81
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,650
Are you trying to say that's contradictory?

82
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,520
Do you believe people have hearts?

83
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,730
Huh? Do they not?

84
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,410
They don't.

85
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,730
They have souls,

86
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,800
but souls aren't hearts.

87
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,900
Then what about my—

88
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:21,160
I'm the only person in this world who
understands the composition of souls.

89
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,890
After all, I change the shape of other
creatures by making contact with them.

90
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,780
All emotions are the result
of the soul's metabolism.

91
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,310
They're far too mechanical to call hearts.

92
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,240
People place too much value
on things they can't see.

93
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,380
I can see them,

94
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,290
and souls are no more special
than physical bodies.

95
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,750
They're just there.

96
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,460
Do you get it?

97
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,060
There's no value or importance to life.

98
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,970
Life just continues its cycle,

99
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,750
same as the waters of the world.

100
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,160
That's true for both you and me.

101
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,200
Our lives are meaningless and have no value.

102
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,020
Li...

103
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,560
And that's why we can do anything we want.

104
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,730
We're free to live our
lives however we please.

105
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,500
You can't let yourself get trapped
in an ideal of indifference.

106
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,400
There's no need for consistency
in how you live your life.

107
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,090
Just as you eat when you get hungry,
you can kill someone if you hate them.

108
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,780
I'll sanction you fully.

109
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,690
There he is.

110
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,140
Huh? Casual clothes?

111
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,590
It looks like he hasn't
attended school for some time.

112
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,920
The same could be said for me, though.

113
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,180
So are the others doing well?

114
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,200
Tuna, tuna!

115
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,680
I hear they're doing quite well.

116
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,130
So what do we do?

117
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,510
We use that.

118
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,500
Huh? Is that a cursed spirit?

119
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,040
It's a fly head,

120
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,700
a low-level curse that doesn't
even qualify as grade 4.

121
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:33,180
Once we reach a place with no people,
we'll have it attack him.

122
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,080
Huh?!

123
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,010
One: if he's a normal person
who can't perceive curses,

124
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,840
please save him.

125
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,690
Two: if he can perceive it,
but has no means to deal with it,

126
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:50,390
likewise, please save him.

127
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,860
Then we'll question him
about the day of the incident.

128
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,620
Three: If he exorcises
the fly head with jujutsu...

129
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,880
we immediately restrain him.

130
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,480
By force?

131
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,990
By force.

132
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,630
If it's a misunderstanding, that's fine.
We'll apologize after the fact.

133
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,230
However...

134
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:13,760
Four: if Yoshino Junpei possesses potential
equal to or greater than a grade 2 sorcerer,

135
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,310
we retreat and meet back up with Nanami-san.

136
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,760
I think I can just barely handle a grade 2.

137
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,280
If this were a cursed spirit, yes.

138
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,070
Huh?

139
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,240
Fushiguro-kun mentioned
it before, remember?

140
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,450
Typically, cursed spirits are assigned
to sorcerers of equal grade.

141
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:43,410
Three

142
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:43,410
Weak

143
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:43,410
Strong

144
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:43,410
Four

145
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:43,410
Two

146
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:43,410
One

147
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:43,410
Special

148
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:43,410
Sorcerer

149
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:43,410
Cursed Spirit

150
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:38,320
That means a grade 2 sorcerer would be
expected to beat grade 2 cursed spirits.

151
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,520
So a grade 2 sorcerer possesses strength
close to a grade 1 cursed spirit.

152
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:48,080
Why wasn't I ever told
something that important?

153
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,060
Because Gojou-san's so irresponsible...

154
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,600
We'll get out of the car here.

155
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,880
This feels like I'm doing all the work,
and I'm really not into it.

156
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,800
If you plan to come out,
please hurry up and do so.

157
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,660
They may be disfigured and beyond saving,

158
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,440
but murdering people makes me sick.

159
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,490
Ah, what a relief.

160
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,080
I'd be in trouble if Gojou Satoru were here,

161
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:36,190
but it's not much of an
experiment if you're too weak.

162
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,100
I hate overtime, so let's just...

163
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,120
finish this quickly.

164
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,010
JUJUTSU KAISEN

165
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,020
JUJUTSU KAISEN

166
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,460
I'll murder you!

167
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,010
They're similar.

168
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,300
That picture-perfect frivolity,

169
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,910
and the sinister strength behind it.

170
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,670
I did block it, didn't I?
With cursed energy.

171
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,800
Is it that kind of technique?

172
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,000
What do you mean, "that kind"?

173
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:43,000
I hate abstract questions that
leave interpretation up to others.

174
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,660
That's good.

175
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,520
So you don't hate chatting, then.

176
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,620
It depends on the person.

177
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,070
This cursed spirit is capable
of conversing quite well,

178
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:58,480
just like the two unregistered
special-grades in Gojou-san's report.

179
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,250
I suppose it would be unnatural
for them to be unrelated.

180
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,830
Hey, tell me.

181
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:09,160
Which do you think came first,
the soul or the body?

182
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,710
Come on, you know.

183
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,950
It's like the question of whether
the chicken or the egg came first.

184
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,400
Do you think the soul resides in the body?

185
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,450
Or do you think the body
forms around the soul?

186
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,450
I have to listen, I guess...

187
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,890
The former.

188
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,880
Bzzt! The answer is the latter.

189
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,840
The soul always exists before the body.

190
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,550
The shape of the body is pulled
along by the shape of the soul.

191
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,340
I'm not healing.

192
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,840
I'm just strongly maintaining
the shape of my own soul.

193
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,240
You understand now, don't you?

194
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,130
My technique is to make contact
with the soul and alter its shape.

195
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,970
Idle Transfiguration.

196
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,650
I keep a stockpile of humans.

197
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,640
It's rather difficult, though.

198
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,790
Normal people eventually die
when their shape is transfigured.

199
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,570
But what about jujutsu sorcerers?

200
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,260
It's 5:30 PM.

201
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,040
I started work at 10 AM today,

202
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:31,650
so I'm getting off at 6 PM,
no matter what it takes.

203
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,290
Yoshino.

204
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,050
Where were you?

205
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,860
You know you shouldn't be skipping school.

206
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,870
Sotomura-sensei.

207
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,170
Did you hear?

208
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:55,540
Apparently Sayama, Nishimura,
and Honda are dead.

209
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,870
You were friends with them, weren't you?

210
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:06,010
They spent a lot of time with you
when you had no other friends, right?

211
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,120
Yet you didn't even attend their funerals...

212
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,940
Honestly, what's wrong with you?

213
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,940
Friends?

214
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:16,290
You should go light some incense
for them. I'll even go with you.

215
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:14,820
Me... and them?

216
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,280
He's insane.

217
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,280
Come on.

218
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,330
You teachers...

219
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,710
You graduate from school
and then go work in schools,

220
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:28,920
so you don't actually experience
the real world, do you?

221
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:34,970
That's how we end up with
overgrown children like you, isn't it?

222
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,860
Here, say "ahh."

223
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,480
Every last one of them!

224
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,320
Look over here!

225
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:47,880
I'll sanction you fully.

226
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,430
What are you mumbling about?

227
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:56,630
Did you lose your mind from
self-isolation? Just kidding.

228
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,550
Stop!

229
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,870
Oh, this guy...

230
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,080
can see it.

231
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,790
Ow!

232
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,050
Damn, that hurt!

233
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,410
Five
Seconds
Before
the
Operation

234
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:21,830
Glance.

235
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,480
Here we go, Itadori-kun!

236
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,430
Time out! There's someone there!

237
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,250
Huh?

238
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,300
Oh, no!

239
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,550
Thank goodness.

240
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,520
What? You a gymnast or something?

241
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,170
Hey, I have some things
I want to ask you about.

242
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,310
Would you come with me?

243
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:42,900
Come on.

244
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,860
That button...

245
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,320
Hold on.

246
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,290
He and I were just talking.

247
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,430
You're rude!

248
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,800
Uh, well, it's a rather important matter.

249
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,060
An important matter?

250
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,820
You're just a kid! What's so important?

251
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,260
And what uniform is tha—

252
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,190
Plop!

253
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,210
What are you doing, you brat?!

254
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,390
Stop! Stop this!

255
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,340
Don't run off with them!

256
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,350
W-Wait!

257
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,820
What was that about?

258
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,530
Okay, now, let's go!

259
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:25,200
Huh?! That was fast!
You already ran that entire lap?!

260
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,020
Yeah.

261
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,960
You didn't have to go through all that.

262
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,680
You could've just dragged me away.

263
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,450
Well, sure.

264
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,360
But you hate that guy, don't you?

265
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:37,490
How do you...

266
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,140
Just a hunch.

267
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,310
Oh, was I wrong?

268
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,920
You're not wrong.

269
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:48,010
You don't want someone you hate loitering
in front of your home forever, right?

270
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,510
Let's head over there for now.

271
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:55,870
Sure.

272
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,960
Your mobility is impressive.

273
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,090
This is so fun!

274
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,200
So the person's original mass is irrelevant
when it comes to changing their shape?

275
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:36,660
Either way, it's a bad
match-up for my technique.

276
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,170
...elp me!

277
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,750
Help... me!

278
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,140
You can't save anyone
once they've been reshaped.

279
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,790
If they attack, kill them without hesitation.

280
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,820
That's better for the victims, too.

281
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,830
Oh, sorry.

282
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,000
I've practiced a lot,

283
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,980
so they don't die right away
when I change their size,

284
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,140
but their... brains? Awareness?

285
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,650
I still lack precision with that,

286
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:11,980
so sometimes their souls sweat like that.

287
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,080
Don't worry about it. Let's continue.

288
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,500
I'm not worried about it.

289
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,880
It's my policy not to bring
personal feelings into work.

290
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,070
You suck at lying!

291
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,470
Your soul is trembling.

292
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,780
So you're... what grade?

293
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,060
Grade 1.

294
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,840
No wonder you're strong.

295
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,040
You'll make the best test subject.

296
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,420
Luck's really on my side.

297
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,260
I'm grateful.

298
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:53,210
Surprised my speed suddenly increased?

299
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:56,770
I can alter the shape of my own soul, too.

300
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,260
Jujutsu sorcerers can protect
their bodies with cursed energy,

301
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,750
but they aren't protecting their souls.

302
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,330
For starters, you have to
be aware of your own soul.

303
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,480
It's not possible to protect
it if you can't do that.

304
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:14,180
But it looks like you subconsciously covered
your soul somewhat with cursed energy.

305
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,920
If you hadn't, you'd already
be under my control.

306
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:23,460
Although, once I touch you two or three
more times, you'll cease to be human.

307
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,100
I'm not letting you go!

308
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,500
Was that it, grade 1 sorcerer?

309
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,050
You did well running around,
but you're at your limit, aren't you?

310
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,990
Unfortunately...

311
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,670
What?

312
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,190
His cursed energy's increasing?

313
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:14,410
I'm going into overtime now.

314
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,550
Juju Stroll

315
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,560
Fushiguro!

316
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,780
Have you seen my uniform jacket?

317
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,930
No, I haven't.

318
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,680
That's weird.

319
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,820
I left it right here...

320
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:00,590
Oh, Panda-senpai. Have you seen my uniform?

321
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,010
I haven't seen it.

322
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,100
Really?

323
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,360
I wonder where it could have gone.

324
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,500
Hey, my skirt's not here, either.

325
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,060
That's a line that can't be crossed.

326
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,590
