00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:09,610
Episode 15: Kyoto Sister School Exchange Event - Group Battle 1 -

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,610
We're starting in one minute.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:16,910
Now, let's hear a few words of well-appreciated
encouragement from Iori Utahime-sensei.

4
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:17,740
Huh?!

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,620
U-Uh...

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:25,460
Um, some degree of injury will be unavoidable,

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:31,130
but, um... now and then, help
each other out... or something...

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,630
Time's up.

9
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,630
Hey! Gojou, you little...

10
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:39,300
Now, let the sister school exchange event...

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,600
begin!

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,560
Respect your seniors!

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,230
Ichiro?!

14
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,900
So stupid.

15
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,980
Where's Toudou?

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,940
What makes you think I would know?

17
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,530
Can't we all get along?

18
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,500
Where do you think
the cursed spirit boss is?

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,590
It was probably unleashed
halfway between both schools,

20
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,960
but it's not just going to sit still.

21
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,880
At the time we agreed upon,

22
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,590
we'll split up into the Megumi squad
and the Panda squad for scouting.

23
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,970
We'll be counting on you after that, Yuuji.

24
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:20,800
Yeah!

25
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,900
Where are you going?

26
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,520
That's small fry.

27
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,700
Senpai, stop!

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,120
Great! You're all here!

29
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,380
Come at me all together!

30
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,260
Scatter!

31
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,600
Toudou was alone.

32
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,890
We were right to swap Yuuji into that role.

33
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,520
I already knew it, but he's a monster.

34
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,400
Yup.

35
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,150
So just ignore him.

36
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,400
Tuna.

37
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,830
JUJUTSU KAISEN

38
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:04,050
Before the Exchange Event Started

39
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,050
Toudou will absolutely be
out to crush us straight away.

40
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,310
Mai might follow behind him
to come after me, too.

41
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,230
Toudou's a monster.

42
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:16,150
The worst possible outcome would be
that we all face him and get wiped out.

43
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,570
So our plan was to leave just one person,

44
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,530
either Panda or Megumi,
behind to occupy him, but...

45
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,450
Itadori, we'll leave that role to you.

46
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,290
We'd rather not lose anyone
who can scout out our enemies.

47
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,540
You don't have to beat him.

48
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,380
Just hold out as long as
possible and buy us time.

49
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,420
But you can be daring against him!

50
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,300
To be blunt, we weren't counting
on your abilities anyway,

51
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,470
so it won't affect us too
much if you have to quit.

52
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,720
That's mean!

53
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,180
Sorry, Megumi.

54
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,600
You wanted to face Toudou, didn't you?

55
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,390
No, I'm good either way.

56
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,980
You're super dry.

57
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,440
But Senpai, if I'm gonna do this,

58
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,490
then I'm gonna win.

59
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,200
Nice speed.

60
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,080
Seriously?

61
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,160
I thought I landed a good one.

62
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,170
I'll return the favor, first-year.

63
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,960
Guard like your life depends on it!

64
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,760
Where?

65
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,570
My arm's... still here?

66
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,740
I thought it got blown off.

67
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,820
If that cursed spirit
hadn't gotten in the way,

68
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,490
that would have been real bad.

69
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,610
Done already?

70
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,910
Now, which should I pursue?

71
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,670
Are you for real?

72
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,890
You think you can just pound
away at my head like that?!

73
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,720
What if you made me even
dumber than I already am?!

74
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,520
Don't worry.

75
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,440
Takada-chan said, "Men are perfect
when they're a little dumb."

76
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,150
Who's that?

77
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,400
I'm not interested in any idols.

78
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,160
Then how did you know she's an idol?

79
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,070
You know who she is, don't you?

80
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,200
What's your name, first-year?

81
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,700
Itadori Yuuji.

82
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,290
I see. Itadori Yuuji.

83
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,710
I have one question for you.

84
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,710
What kind of woman is your type?

85
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,460
Huh?

86
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,380
What's my type?

87
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,390
Why are you asking me that right now?

88
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,220
Don't worry about that.
I'm just appraising you.

89
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,730
I don't really get it, but if I had to say...

90
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,820
A tall woman with a big ass, I guess?

91
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,070
Like Jennifer Lawrence.

92
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,170
The new series is pretty good.

93
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:12,900
Oh?

94
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,610
I'm going to confess to Takada-chan.

95
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,900
Huh?! Don't do that!

96
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,990
I don't wanna have to comfort you later!

97
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,490
That's such a pain!

98
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,040
Why are you assuming she'll reject me?

99
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,040
I could ask you why you
think she'll say yes.

100
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,090
Anne Sullivan once said to Helen Keller,

101
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:54,260
"What fool thinks of defeat
before even trying?"

102
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,050
Inoki was the one who said that.

103
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,300
I'm sorry.

104
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,560
I'm already in love with someone.

105
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,080
Any chance that someone is me?

106
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,500
No way, man.

107
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,040
Come on, let's go.

108
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,960
I'll treat you to some ramen.

109
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,230
You never lost to anyone
in your hometown, huh?

110
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:59,870
Seems like we're best friends!

111
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,910
When you just learned my name?!

112
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,750
Yeah, continue straight that way.

113
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,330
Toudou-kun's there, though.

114
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,960
Not a problem.

115
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,290
He's the one who told us to do as we pleased.

116
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,010
New Shadow Style, Simple Domain:

117
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,560
Quick Draw!

118
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,770
What reflexes!

119
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:36,570
I know I hesitated, but still,
my counter didn't even scratch him!

120
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,870
I'm surrounded?

121
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,340
Wait...

122
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,370
Are these guys...

123
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,840
trying to kill me?

124
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,390
This is...

125
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,260
Itadori and I switched places?!

126
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:07,930
Hey.

127
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,520
I told you I'd kill you if
you interfered, didn't I?

128
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,570
No, you didn't.

129
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,530
You said you'd kill us if
we ordered you around.

130
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,570
Was that Itadori's...

131
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,280
No, it was Toudou's technique?

132
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:26,330
Same thing. Piss off!

133
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,170
Looks like he's retreating.

134
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,590
Lame.

135
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,080
Thank goodness!

136
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,590
Make sure you kill him.

137
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,590
That depends on Itadori.

138
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,470
Don't order me around.

139
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,260
What's with these people,

140
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,980
trying to kill me and then
arguing with each other?

141
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:57,110
After all, I'm not an inconsiderate man
who'd hold back against his best friend!

142
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:08,080
This is why I said to leave him be.

143
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,290
We're off to a rocky start.

144
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:15,210
We can't start hunting down cursed spirits
without me scouting from the air, either.

145
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,760
They're all such a hassle.

146
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,720
Hang in there, me.

147
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,130
You're as cute as ever today.

148
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,430
Take her down.

149
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,260
Oh, no.

150
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,560
Mai, Mechamaru, cover Nishimiya.

151
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,390
At once.

152
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:36,280
Well, we are in trouble without her.

153
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,950
Kamo-san, are you guys

154
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,580
planning to kill Itadori?

155
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,970
JUJUTSU KAISEN

156
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,970
JUJUTSU KAISEN

157
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,620
That's strange.

158
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,600
It is strange.

159
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,900
All the Kyoto students are moving together.

160
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,110
Toward the area we left Yuuji in.

161
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,690
I think that puts everyone from Kyoto there?

162
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,320
You mean that's where the target is?

163
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,910
No, unless the second-grade
is especially cunning,

164
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,450
my Demon Dog would have noticed it.

165
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:37,000
They're trying to kill Itadori, aren't they?

166
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,880
What the hell?! I don't see why!

167
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,590
It's possible.

168
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,380
Kelp.

169
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,390
I didn't sense that much hostility from them,

170
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,810
but that was prior to Yuuji's surprise survival.

171
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:01,420
It's entirely possible that
Principal Gakuganji would order that.

172
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:07,400
Are the Kyoto students a bunch of cowards
who'd kill a person on someone else's orders?

173
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,780
They don't see him the same way.

174
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:13,410
You two have spent day after day with Yuuji.

175
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:17,210
We only recently learned that
he's a good person ourselves.

176
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:20,040
He's a naturally happy sort you
don't often see among sorcerers.

177
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,420
But the thing is...

178
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,920
To those who don't know
anything about Yuuji,

179
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,430
the vessel of Sukuna
is just an object of fear.

180
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:33,430
It wouldn't feel any different
from exorcising a curse to them.

181
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:39,440
Even normal jujutsu sorcerers
can easily blur that line.

182
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,690
We're turning back, Megumi.

183
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,780
Sorry.

184
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,860
What are you apologizing for, dummy?

185
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,700
There's no point in winning or losing
the exchange event if your friend dies.

186
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:59,620
Nobara and I will go back
to confirm that Yuuji's safe.

187
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,830
He's not answering his phone, either.

188
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:05,340
Toge, you keep hunting down
the cursed spirit, please.

189
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,170
Bonito flakes.

190
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,970
I know you're worried about Yuuji, too.

191
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,100
But if my prediction is correct,

192
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,600
the Kyoto students are trying

193
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,480
to use the chaos of the group
battle to assassinate Yuuji.

194
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,130
Once the group battle's over,
there won't be any assassination.

195
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,320
Makes sense.

196
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,480
Salmon.

197
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,570
I'm worried about Maki, too.

198
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,320
We won't let them kill Yuuji,

199
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,110
and we'll win this group battle.

200
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,910
Of course.

201
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,120
Answer on the first ring, Fushiguro!

202
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:45,840
Also, why didn't they provide us with
wireless radios or Bluetooth earbuds?!

203
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,130
I wouldn't want them.

204
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:51,010
They're distracting, and they startle
you when you get a call.

205
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,470
You can take them off during combat!

206
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,140
Ow...

207
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,520
So that's Fushiguro-kun's Nue, huh?

208
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,900
Electrified wings.

209
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,570
Looks like they'll affect
my movement for a while.

210
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:17,080
Nishimiya-chan!

211
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,580
Come and play!

212
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,460
So crass!

213
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,830
Not cute at all.

214
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,300
Kamo-san, are you guys
planning to kill Itadori?

215
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:32,300
And if I said we were?

216
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,280
You failed, then.

217
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,810
Itadori wouldn't go down in such a short time.

218
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,730
We have no reason to kill him.

219
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,900
Yes, you do.

220
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,520
The higher-ups and the three
major clans have plenty.

221
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,520
What splendid toughness!

222
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,560
He's actively using the landscape
to his advantage, too!

223
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,110
He's gone?

224
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,650
He's also quick to set up his next move!

225
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,670
And to top it off...

226
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,130
He has such tremendous power!

227
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,590
His raw strength is greater than mine,
despite his small body!

228
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,630
Which is why his blows are effective
with so little cursed energy!

229
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:59,640
And that makes it hard to read his movements
from the flow of cursed energy!

230
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:03,220
But the way this cursed
energy hits after a time lag...

231
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,060
That's just... That's just...

232
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:10,860
...wrong!

233
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:14,070
...wrong!

234
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,650
...wrong!

235
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:17,320
...wrong!

236
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,990
...wrong!

237
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,700
...wrong!

238
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,160
Was that Toudou?

239
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,160
It was.

240
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:32,340
I think I understand why you
failed to finish off Yuuji.

241
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,720
So why did you distance
yourself from Noritoshi?

242
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,760
Are you keeping your technique
a secret from your allies, too?

243
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,390
I'm sorry about Itadori-kun.

244
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:51,270
I know this is an excuse,
but I'm not like the others.

245
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:56,400
Still, that doesn't mean I plan to hand
over victory in this exchange event.

246
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:01,780
Recommendation

247
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,780
You know that sorcerers advance in rank
through a recommendation system, right?

248
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,120
The exchange event is often discussed among
sorcerers without connections up the chain.

249
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,920
Students who perform well here

250
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,790
are granted many chances to
advance while they're studying.

251
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,050
Coincidentally, the person in charge
of a student can't recommend them.

252
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:24,300
Recommendation

253
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:24,300
For example, Gojou-san couldn't
recommend Itadori-kun to be a first-grade.

254
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:29,310
I want to become independent as
quickly as possible so I can earn money.

255
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:34,770
Why?

256
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,190
I'm poor!

257
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,820
And I have two little brothers!

258
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,700
Are you okay?

259
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,910
Are you getting along well enough with Mai?

260
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,540
Aren't you too nice a person?

261
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,290
Huh? Probably...

262
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,670
I won't hold back, you know.

263
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,460
Not a problem!

264
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,170
That's not what I said all that for, anyway!

265
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,010
My friend!

266
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,510
That cursed energy you
blast with a time lag...

267
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,890
That's a bad habit of yours!

268
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,680
You mean Divergent Fist?

269
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,850
What's he on about all of a sudden?

270
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,440
So long as you're satisfied with that,
you'll never beat me!

271
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,900
If you're satisfied with
staying on that level,

272
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,070
you and I won't stay best friends.

273
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,330
Are you okay with that?!

274
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:29,450
I don't know. I don't care about that.

275
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,790
Are you okay with staying weak?

276
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,500
No, I'm not!

277
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,880
That's right!

278
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,550
My best friend!

279
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,480
Juju Stroll

280
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,730
Q: What kind of person is your type?

281
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,990
Someone who's stronger
than me, at the very least.

282
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,240
Huh? What makes you think I'll answer?

283
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:33,750
I totally can't stand a UBSSD.

284
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,900
Useless

285
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,900
Broke

286
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,900
Smelly

287
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,900
Stingy

288
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:34,900
Dead

289
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,780
Do you know who Sebastian Stan is?

290
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:41,170
He has a great body.

291
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:47,570
Well, you know, I like
hot guys, like most girls,

292
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:50,840
but I want someone fun to be around, too,

293
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:57,560
and it's important whether or not he can
make you feel like he's the only one for you.

294
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:02,720
Oh, gosh, how embarrassing!

295
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:07,020
Uh, you know, uh, um...

296
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,860
Wh-What was it?

297
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,690
Um...

298
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:11,860
Um, um, um...

299
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,380
You know, that girl who seemed nice.

300
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,540
The one who seemed nice.

301
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,340
With the notable bangs.

302
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,580
Come on, come on, you know! That one girl!

303
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:23,470
Nice girl, nice girl, nice girl...

304
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:42,240
Oh, Miwa?

305
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,700
Yeah! Her, her, her, her, her!

306
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:56,340
Episode 16:
Kyoto Sister School Exchange Event - Group Battle 2 -
