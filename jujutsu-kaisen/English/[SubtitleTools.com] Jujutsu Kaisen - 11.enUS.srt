1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,470
Was that it, grade 1 sorcerer?

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:07,080
You did well running around,
but you're at your limit, aren't you?

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,940
Unfortunately...

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,610
What?

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,710
His cursed energy's increasing?

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,210
I'm going into overtime now.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,690
Overtime?

8
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,200
A time-based pact!

9
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,020
He was limiting his own cursed
energy this whole time?!

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,710
Fun!

11
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,000
My cursed technique draws
a line along the target and,

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,980
using a ratio of 7:3,
creates a weak point at that location.

13
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,990
I can create this line along more than
just their full height or wingspan.

14
00:00:54,370 --> 00:01:01,600
I can designate it along various parts, such
as the head, upper arm, forearm, and so on.

15
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:07,630
This cursed technique can affect more
than just living creatures, as well.

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,040
He's revealing his technique?

17
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,010
You're serious, huh?

18
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,990
At present, the first way I can
see to exorcise this cursed spirit

19
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,840
Playing tag again?

20
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,190
is to continue damaging him until
he runs out of cursed energy.

21
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,990
However, that's not very realistic for me.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,640
The second way is to reduce him
to smithereens with a single blow.

23
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,890
Ratio Technique: Collapse!

24
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,380
What power!

25
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,270
No, more importantly,
cursed energy raced through it?

26
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,330
No way!

27
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:49,130
It's an expanded technique that imbues
the destroyed target with cursed energy!

28
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,050
It's a wide-range attack
that puts him at risk, too.

29
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,760
So I guess...

30
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,630
I should dodge this one.

31
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,520
I'm retreating for now.

32
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,610
You should get that leg healed quickly.

33
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:10,050
If we both manage to survive, let's meet again.

34
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:34,000
JUJUTSU KAISEN

35
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:55,490
Episode 11:  Narrow-minded

36
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:50,950
Huh?

37
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,900
Did the ground just shake?

38
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,980
Yeah, it did. Intensity 2 or so?

39
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,760
Nope, Ijichi-san's not answering.

40
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,780
Should I really be the one to ask this?

41
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,160
Is it really okay to just ask him
straight-up about that, though?

42
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,840
How much am I allowed to reveal
about Jujutsu Tech, anyway?

43
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,610
Ijichi Kiyotaka

44
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,360
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached at this time.

45
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,360
Just answer!

46
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,000
Wait!

47
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,170
I wonder what's going on.

48
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,000
A button with a swirl?

49
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,350
Yup.

50
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,770
If you meet a student wearing this button
with a swirl, you should be friendly to them.

51
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,270
Because they're jujutsu sorcerers.

52
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,310
I'm sure you'll get along with them.

53
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,740
But the jujutsu sorcerers are
Mahito-san's enemies, right?

54
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,060
Forget it! I'm just going to ask!

55
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,100
Listen, there were people who died at
the theater you went to the other day.

56
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,360
Did you happen to see anything?

57
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,360
A creepy thing like this, maybe?

58
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,980
No, I didn't.

59
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,730
I've only recently started
seeing those clearly.

60
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,600
I see.

61
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,110
Well, I've got nothing else to ask, then!

62
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,280
Huh? That's it?

63
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:15,040
But could you still wait until my...
I guess he's like my boss... shows up?

64
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,370
Yeah, sure.

65
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,670
Thanks!

66
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,690
Hey.

67
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,760
What were you watching at that theater?

68
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,500
It was a repeat screening of an old movie.
I doubt you'd know it if I told you.

69
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,180
Come on, just tell me.

70
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,970
Human Earthworm

71
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,990
Human Earthworm 3.

72
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,780
That one was super boring!

73
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,400
I got hit so many times over that.

74
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,120
You got hit?

75
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,190
Honestly, it was.

76
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,910
But it's just a splatter film,

77
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:44,900
so maybe it's our own fault for
asking it to deliver more than that.

78
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,220
But 2 was—

79
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,320
But 2 was pretty good, right?

80
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,700
Yeah! Yeah, it was!

81
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,060
It was the only one with
a way you could enjoy it!

82
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,360
Huh? A way to enjoy it?

83
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,360
Bingo.

84
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,640
Have you seen the entire series?

85
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:05,490
At first, 2 looks like it wouldn't
be any different from 1 or 3,

86
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,270
but it actually captures

87
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,190
the changing emotions of the perfectionist
who abandons everything.

88
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,550
Mama...

89
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,290
Ah, so that's why I was able to watch 2.

90
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,510
Why?

91
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,430
At first, I couldn't understand
what was good about it,

92
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,250
so I made myself watch it three times.

93
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,760
It had the most effective gory scenes,
too, so it wasn't easy to rewatch.

94
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,320
Why'd you go that far?

95
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,000
Do you like movies, Itadori-kun?

96
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,470
I've been watching a lot of them
lately, for certain reasons.

97
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,710
Though I haven't been seeing them in theaters.

98
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,540
What?

99
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,610
But the emotional impact of finding
a good one at the theater is huge.

100
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,740
Even if on-demand is more convenient.

101
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,220
When was the last time I saw one in a theater?

102
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,390
Take me with you next time
there's one you're into.

103
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,000
Huh?

104
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,030
Oh, need my contact info?

105
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:57,760
Here.

106
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,040
How do I add friends again?

107
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,770
Oh, Junpei?

108
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,870
Mom.

109
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,310
It's unusual to see you out here.

110
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,470
Is this a friend?

111
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,360
We just met, actually.

112
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,360
We may have just met,
but I think we can be friends.

113
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,480
Really? I hope you get along well, then.

114
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,450
Mom!

115
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,380
I asked you...

116
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,870
to quit smoking.

117
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,350
Oh, right, sorry.

118
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,230
I did promise not to smoke
in front of you anymore.

119
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,410
What's your friend's name?

120
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,220
Itadori Yuuji.

121
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,500
The green onion doesn't suit your look.

122
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,950
Oh, you can tell?

123
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,540
I'm trying to be a woman who doesn't
look good with green onions.

124
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,260
What are you even talking about?

125
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,950
So, Yuuji-kun, care to join us for dinner?

126
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,330
H-Hey! You're just bothering him.

127
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,030
Huh? Are you saying my cooking is a nuisance?

128
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:53,530
Cramp

129
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,950
R
u
m
b
l
e

130
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,280
Anything you don't like? Any allergies?

131
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,150
Nope!

132
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,600
That sorcerer's more reckless than he looks!

133
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,870
You two went at it quite hard.

134
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,080
Getou!

135
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,740
That guy was interesting.

136
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,520
I learned a lot from him.

137
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,270
Oh?

138
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:36,520
Even if I'm pulverized, I won't die as
long as I maintain the shape of my soul.

139
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:40,580
Consumption of cursed energy counts
toward supplementation of the self.

140
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,520
Also, it looks like there's no risk to me,

141
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,100
no matter how much I tweak
the shape of my own soul.

142
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,480
Next time, I'll let loose and
try all kinds of things.

143
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,260
Getou, get me some clothes.

144
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,590
Nope.

145
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,520
What happened to the guy you fought?

146
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,180
I don't know.

147
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,840
He said he was retreating, but he
might be buried under the rubble.

148
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,070
What? You're at Yoshino Junpei's home?!

149
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,400
That's a bit of a...

150
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,600
Oh, it's fine.

151
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,750
Well, I'm about to have dinner.

152
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,810
Dinner?!

153
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,060
I'll head there at once.

154
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,120
If you sense anything odd,
please run immediately.

155
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,070
Even if Yoshino Junpei is involved
in this incident as a perpetrator,

156
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:25,280
I doubt he could quickly kill
Itadori-kun as he is now.

157
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,170
But still, this is a huge blunder
on my part as his supervisor.

158
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,530
As blithe as Gojou-san is, he might not mind,

159
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,500
but if the adult-of-adults,
Nanami-san, chews me out...

160
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,530
I'll probably cry!

161
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,100
Hurry up now!

162
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,020
You don't want to cry in front
of others at your age, do you?!

163
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:50,310
Nanami Kento

164
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,800
He's calling me earlier than scheduled!

165
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,320
Yeah, he's going to chew me out!

166
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,440
Hello, I'm sorry.

167
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:57,720
I just sent you my location data.
Please come and pick me up.

168
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,020
I'm going back to Jujutsu Tech to
receive treatment from Ieiri-san.

169
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,790
Treatment?

170
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,050
Don't worry.

171
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,200
It's not an injury that'll kill me.

172
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,590
That's good.

173
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,910
I'll join up with Itadori-kun soon,

174
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,370
then I'll head your way.

175
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,560
He's not with you?

176
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,720
I'm such an idiot!

177
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,790
I've practiced a lot...

178
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,190
You'll make the best test subject.

179
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,590
Luck's really on my side.

180
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,120
That cursed spirit is a child.

181
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,840
It probably hasn't been very
long since he sprang into being.

182
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,990
He's greedily enjoying his own growth.

183
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:51,280
The special-grade cursed spirits that Gojou-san
fought had mastered domain expansion.

184
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:57,210
If he managed to survive, it won't be much
longer before he reaches that stage, too.

185
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,600
On top of that, his victim count
far exceeded our expectations.

186
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,240
Help... me!

187
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,880
We need to exorcise him as soon as possible,

188
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,940
before it's too late.

189
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:17,910
And then?

190
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,120
So then Takashi-kun says, full of confidence...

191
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,670
This is the larva of an invasive species!

192
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,160
It might be poisonous!

193
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,630
Nobody touch it!

194
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,860
So then I tried picking it up,

195
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,120
and it turned out to be a
konjac noodle from lunch!

196
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,850
Wait, konjac? It was a konjac noodle?!

197
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,560
Mom, you've had too much to drink.

198
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,750
You're funny, Yuuji-kun.

199
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,370
Here, do something funny with these!

200
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,330
She's the worst kind of drunk.

201
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,560
Wilson! Wilson!

202
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,970
Forgive me, Wilson!

203
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,330
That's from Cast Away, isn't it?

204
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,820
You got it!

205
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,630
I don't get it. Is that a movie reference?

206
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,660
Fire!

207
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,500
Your mom's really nice.

208
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,900
Yeah.

209
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,460
School?

210
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,960
It's okay. You don't have to go.

211
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,740
Huh?

212
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,180
Kids your age tend to take
everything too seriously.

213
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,620
School is just a tiny aquarium.

214
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,750
There's a whole ocean out there,
and other aquariums, too.

215
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,200
Pick the one you want.

216
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:40,390
Hey, that was a really cool
thing to say, wasn't it?

217
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:43,800
What a brilliant saying. Way to go, me!

218
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,690
What's your mom like?

219
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,610
Uh, I've never met her.

220
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,460
Though I have a few faint
memories of my father...

221
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,210
But my grandpa was there for me.

222
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,640
Oh, sorry. Got a call.

223
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,000
Hello, Ijichi-san?

224
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,440
Yeah, I'm fine.

225
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,500
But we're about to watch a movie.

226
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,170
Okay.

227
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,730
Two hours from now, then.

228
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,710
Two ho—

229
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,850
You're a jujutsu sorcerer, right?

230
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,120
Yeah.

231
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,650
Should I have said that?

232
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,830
Have you... ever killed someone?

233
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,520
No.

234
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:36,790
But someday you'll have to fight
bad jujutsu sorcerers, right?

235
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,740
What will you do then?

236
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,800
I still wouldn't want to kill them.

237
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,560
Why not? They're bad people.

238
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,330
It's like... I just think, if I killed anyone,

239
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:53,200
the option of "killing" would
force its way into my life.

240
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:56,420
The value of life would become ambiguous...

241
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,340
I wouldn't even understand the importance
of those I care about anymore.

242
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,790
And that scares me.

243
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,070
People don't have hearts.

244
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,670
That idea saved me.

245
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,090
It gave me strength.

246
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,580
But if killing someone

247
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,790
would mean tainting my soul...

248
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,310
then I can't kill anyone.

249
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,970
Darn, I feel asleep.

250
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,610
Did Yuuji-kun go home already?

251
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,500
Gah! It's already this late?

252
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,690
I need to clean up.

253
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,070
What's this?

254
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,880
A finger?

255
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,950
JUJUTSU KAISEN

256
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,960
JUJUTSU KAISEN

257
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:11,470
After the Satozakura High School Incident

258
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,470
After the incident at Satozakura High School,

259
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:16,370
we discovered the corpse of Yoshino Nagi,
Yoshino Junpei's mother, at their home,

260
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:19,860
along with an unsealed Sukuna's Finger—
his second left arm's pinky finger.

261
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:25,490
We believe Yoshino Nagi was attacked by
cursed spirits drawn to Sukuna's Finger.

262
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,000
Her remains were missing
everything from the waist down.

263
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,010
There were no visible or detectable
traces of blood found on-site,

264
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:37,380
and Yoshino Nagi's body was
lying down in her bedroom.

265
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:43,570
Lifting up the blanket revealed only cold
packs and ice bags spread out beneath it.

266
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:48,000
Are you saying I'd get in the way, Nanamin?

267
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,530
You're injured, aren't you?

268
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,480
Next time, take me with you.

269
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,530
"My partner died.

270
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,530
But I wasn't there at the time.

271
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:59,540
Why? Because I'm a child."

272
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,320
You're a strong kid, so help others.

273
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,860
I don't want any of that.

274
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:09,940
You can't.

275
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,820
As you already know, this patchwork
cursed spirit uses transfigured people.

276
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,000
There are some people who are beyond saving.

277
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,960
If you continue this work,

278
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,580
there will a come a time when you're
forced to kill a person yourself.

279
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,420
But this is not that time.

280
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,600
I still wouldn't want to kill them.

281
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,310
And that scares me.

282
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,120
Please understand this.

283
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,530
Being a child is not a sin.

284
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,220
I would like to ask you to continue
monitoring Yoshino Junpei.

285
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,060
I didn't own any black clothing,

286
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,270
so I opened my mom's closet

287
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:58,030
and put on the first
thing that caught my eye.

288
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:04,820
The smell of the morning air and the
commute to school were all familiar,

289
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:06,720
but today...

290
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,380
This is

291
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:13,650
a cursed object known as "Sukuna"
that attracts other curses.

292
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,660
What was a thing like that doing in my home?!

293
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,350
There are many curse users who
earn money by cursing people.

294
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,320
It was probably done by one of them.

295
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:27,520
With money and connections,
it's easy to curse someone to death.

296
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,650
Can you think of anyone?

297
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,440
Anyone who might hold a grudge
against you or your mother?

298
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,280
Or perhaps...

299
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:39,250
someone dark and gloomy,
with plenty of money and free time?

300
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,490
The certificate of commendation

301
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:46,410
and the prize for the finest work in the
national book report competition goes to

302
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,150
Itou Shouta.

303
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,440
One, two...

304
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,850
Shouta-senpai!

305
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,830
Gosh, they're embarrassing me.

306
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,650
We are extremely pleased to have

307
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:08,520
a student of our school as the winner
of such an honorable award.

308
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,830
What the hell were you thinking?

309
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,790
I told you to just write whatever,

310
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:10,420
but you made me win top damn prize.

311
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,590
This is all thanks to constant,
daily efforts finally bearing fruit.

312
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,390
You want to die?

313
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,120
I-I'm sorry.

314
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,990
I hope all of you will take this opportunity

315
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,410
Yet you only landed a participation prize.

316
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,950
to cultivate a habit of reading
in your daily lives.

317
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:21,420
Shouta-senpai really is cool.

318
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:25,060
Next we have the award of
excellence for Matsutani Tooru.

319
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,510
Right?

320
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:25,820
That so? Well, I'll give
him props for being rich.

321
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,060
What's that black stuff?

322
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,820
Huh? Where?

323
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,650
Emerge from darkness,
blacker than darkness.

324
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,380
Purify that which is impure.

325
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,960
Hey, I did it.

326
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,620
Thanks, Mahito.

327
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,580
I can't afford to leave any
residuals of me behind.

328
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,550
What are the veil's effects?

329
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,540
They cannot escape from inside.

330
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,030
Some can enter from outside,

331
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,210
but only those with weak cursed energy.

332
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,550
It's an unannounced veil
in a residential area.

333
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,620
The windows will report it right away.

334
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:12,310
I hope this plays out as you believe it will.

335
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,880
I think it'll go fine.

336
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:21,650
The general course was already set
once Junpei landed Sukuna's vessel.

337
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,020
I'll cause the two of them to clash,
and force Itadori Yuuji

338
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,160
into a pact giving Sukuna dominance.

339
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,710
I sure wish Jougo was as level-headed as you.

340
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,560
But it's cute how honest
and straightforward he is.

341
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,110
Anyway, you okay with this?

342
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,920
That finger was a precious resource, right?

343
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,480
It's fine.

344
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,250
The finger from the juvenile center was
quickly absorbed into Itadori Yuuji, after all.

345
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:50,800
I'd like to have Jujutsu Tech retrieve the one
we placed at Yoshino Junpei's home, as well.

346
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,810
Another ploy?

347
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:54,710
Yeah.

348
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,930
Well, I'll be taking my leave.

349
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,950
Huh? You're leaving?

350
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,830
You should stay and watch, too.

351
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,950
I'm sure it'll be fun...

352
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,350
watching foolish kids die.

353
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,290
H-Hey! What's wrong with you guys?!

354
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,730
Get a grip! Are you okay?!

355
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,400
They're not dead.

356
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,660
Yoshino?

357
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,070
Why...

358
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,890
Wait, do you know what's going on here?

359
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,340
Sensei.

360
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,380
Make sure you're watching...

361
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,510
You... Those scars...

362
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,040
That's—

363
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,130
...what's already happened,

364
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,420
and what's about to happen.

365
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,290
Yoshino...

366
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,430
I have a question for you.

367
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,850
Are you the one who left that in my home?

368
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,270
What are you—

369
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,820
Wh-What is this?

370
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,170
What did you do?!

371
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,820
That's no good.

372
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:12,320
Do you still think you're in a position to
answer questions with your own questions?

373
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,970
You are going to die.

374
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,970
Whether your answer is yes or no.

375
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,870
After all, I don't have a technique
to see through your lies,

376
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:25,330
and you've already done more
than enough to earn it!

377
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,730
So show some sincerity in
your final moments, at least.

378
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:33,070
I'm... sorry...

379
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,100
And?

380
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,240
Come on!

381
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:51,520
What are you doing, Junpei?!

382
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,500
Stay out of this, jujutsu sorcerer.

383
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,180
Juju Stroll

384
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,430
The layout was great, but a
three-burner range portends death.

385
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:36,160
Set it ablaze, Mt. Hiei!
Matsutake for aroma, shimeji for flavor!

386
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,550
The tones of autumn disappear,

387
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,480
together with the tears of the beloved!

388
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,490
