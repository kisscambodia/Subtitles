1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,320
This sucks!

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,410
If you're gonna switch, just do it already!

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,130
What's the matter, brat?

4
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,430
The Innate Domain's closed off!

5
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,880
The special-grade is dead!

6
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,330
Now we just need Itadori to return safely...

7
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,640
Sorry, but he's not coming back.

8
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,860
Don't be so frightened.

9
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,050
I'm in a great mood right now.

10
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,360
Let's chat for a bit.

11
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,600
This is what he gets for trying to
use me without any kind of pact.

12
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,560
Feels like he's having some
trouble switching back.

13
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,720
Still, though...

14
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,570
It's only a matter of time.

15
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,350
So...

16
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,670
I thought about what I can do right now.

17
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,810
Wh-What are you...

18
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,350
I'm taking this brat hostage.

19
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,580
Hostage?!

20
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,320
Yeah.

21
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,040
I can live without this,

22
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,800
but that ain't true for the brat.

23
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,980
Switching out with me means he dies.

24
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,240
Also...

25
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,080
For good measure.

26
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,670
Sukuna's finger!

27
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,090
That special-grade cursed spirit
in there must have consumed it!

28
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,330
With that, I'm free as a bird.

29
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,060
You can be frightened now.

30
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,270
I'll kill you!

31
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,720
For no particular reason.

32
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,340
Our positions are reversed now.

33
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:40,000
Jujutsu Kaisen

34
00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:00,550
Episode 5:  Curse Womb Must Die -II-

35
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,520
The only thing granted equally
to all is an unfair reality.

36
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,090
You just don't get it.

37
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,490
He's...

38
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,810
Itadori's coming back.

39
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,480
Even if that means he'll die.

40
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,440
That's just who he is.

41
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,450
You give him too much credit.

42
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,550
This guy's just a little tougher
and denser than other humans.

43
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:36,170
Just a moment ago, he was scared out
of his mind, on the verge of death,

44
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,840
and prattling on about his
regrets and all that nonsense.

45
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:44,590
I know for a fact he doesn't
have the guts to kill himself.

46
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,510
His arm is restored!

47
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,770
Healing...

48
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,950
He can use Reverse Cursed Techniques.

49
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,910
Sukuna's incarnated.

50
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,410
Even if he can live without a heart,
it should still be damaging to him.

51
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,730
I'll make him heal his heart
before Itadori returns.

52
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:12,270
I just have to make him believe he can't
beat me without a heart in his body!

53
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,920
Can I do that...

54
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,670
when I couldn't even move with
that special-grade in front of me?

55
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,850
It's not about whether I can.

56
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,760
I have to do it!

57
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,410
I'm finally outside, after all.

58
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,060
Let's use the open space.

59
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,720
Interesting.

60
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,550
You use Shikigami,

61
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,120
but you'll still come at me yourself?

62
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,470
More.

63
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,720
More.

64
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,340
More!

65
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,030
Put more curse behind it

66
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,180
when you strike me!

67
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,060
Orochi!

68
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,200
Gang up on him!

69
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,840
Hey, what did I just say?

70
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,650
Let's use the open space!

71
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,330
It's not even a matter of jujutsu.

72
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,840
His power

73
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,330
and his agility

74
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,550
are on a different scale.

75
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,210
Nice technique there.

76
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,360
What do I do?

77
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,990
I used up one of my shikigami
to escape that Innate Domain.

78
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,320
Demon Dog White and
Orochi are both destroyed...

79
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,880
And Nue's at his limit, too.

80
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,030
I should release him
before he gets destroyed.

81
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,120
I get it now.

82
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,180
So your shikigami are created from shadows.

83
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,370
It makes no difference if he knows that now.

84
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,190
So what?

85
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:01,680
Hmm...

86
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,040
It's not the generic technique
that uses charms.

87
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,840
It's adaptable, too.

88
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,980
I don't get it, though.

89
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,970
Why did you run back then?

90
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,230
What a waste of talent.

91
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,690
Whatever.

92
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,830
Either way, that won't be enough to fix this.

93
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,390
He's figured it out, huh?

94
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,390
You're risking your life over stupid shit.

95
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:32,530
This brat isn't even worth that much.

96
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,990
Then why did you bother saving me?!

97
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:46,480
The only thing granted equally
to all is an unfair reality.

98
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,920
If I have the time to curse someone,

99
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,420
I'd rather spend it thinking
about those precious to me.

100
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,640
There was no room to doubt
what a good person she was.

101
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,740
She deserved happiness
more than anyone else.

102
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,910
But Tsumiki was still cursed.

103
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:14,680
The father who named me "Megumi"
with no regard for my gender

104
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,840
is still off living as he pleases somewhere.

105
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,160
Karma isn't fully automatic.

106
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:30,130
Evil people can only be judged under the law.

107
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,670
Jujutsu sorcerers are just another
cog in that machine of retribution.

108
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:46,420
I want more good people to
enjoy fairness, even if only a few,

109
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,650
so I...

110
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,530
save people unequally!

111
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,910
Nice.

112
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,700
That's it.

113
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:07,430
So this is when you start
burning through your life!

114
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,100
Now I see.

115
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,040
Well, in that case...

116
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,770
Show me, Fushiguro Megumi!

117
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:23,430
Sacred treasure swing
and ring, ring -Eight Grip-!

118
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,390
Just so you know, I...

119
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:37,490
don't have any logical reason
for saving you back then.

120
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,390
Even if it was dangerous, I couldn't bear
to see a good person like you die.

121
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,700
I did have my reservations,

122
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,580
but ultimately, it was for
selfish, emotional reasons.

123
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,030
That's fine, though.

124
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,720
I'm not a hero.

125
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,560
I'm a jujutsu sorcerer.

126
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,720
So I've never once regretted saving you.

127
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,690
I see.

128
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,930
You really are smart, Fushiguro.

129
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,200
You've put more thought into this than I have.

130
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,990
I think your conviction's a proper one,

131
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,660
but I don't think mine is wrong, either.

132
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,840
Oh, sorry, I'm almost done for.

133
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:35,470
Guess I won't have to worry about you,
Kugisaki, or Gojou-sensei.

134
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,760
Live a long life.

135
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,950
Jujutsu Kaisen

136
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,960
Jujutsu Kaisen

137
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,330
Well, tell me.

138
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:35,980
Was there any real reason
to use a precious finger

139
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,790
to test Sukuna's strength?

140
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,280
Well, there wasn't much point to it
with a half-baked test case.

141
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,130
But we did learn a few things.

142
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,940
Hmph. I'll be praying that's not just an excuse.

143
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:54,630
Stop talking! No one
understands what you're saying!

144
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,750
We don't understand, yet the meaning
flows right into our minds. It's creepy!

145
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,380
Café Restaurant
Rice

146
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,720
Welcome!

147
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,540
Would you like a seat for one?

148
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,970
Yes, one, please.

149
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:30,610
If you encounter it, your choices
are to either run or die.

150
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,600
I warned them that fighting
was absolutely not an option.

151
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,770
It was intentional.

152
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,110
Huh? What do you mean?

153
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,260
There was a special-grade.

154
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,310
Sending first-years to rescue
five who may or may not be alive

155
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,310
should be out of the question.

156
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,000
Besides, with Yuuji,

157
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,540
I was the one who forced the issue and
got his execution indefinitely suspended.

158
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,440
Some higher-ups who didn't like that

159
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,840
took advantage of my absence
and the special-grade

160
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:03,530
to tactfully dispose of him.

161
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,210
If the other two had also died,
it'd be more harassment for me

162
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,650
and two birds with one stone for them.

163
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,550
No, but...

164
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,030
No one expected it to become a special-grade
by the time the dispatch was issued.

165
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,670
Searching for someone to blame is just a pain.

166
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,280
Maybe I should just...

167
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,800
kill all of the higher-ups.

168
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,520
You're not usually this emotional.

169
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,280
It's good to see you, Ieiri-san!

170
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,450
Looks to me...

171
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,910
like you've taken quite a liking to him.

172
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,350
I've always been a nice guy
who cares for my students.

173
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,360
Don't torment Ijichi too much.

174
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,730
He's got it rough, stuck
between us and the higher-ups.

175
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:54,760
Keep going! Keep going! Keep going!

176
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,210
I don't care about a man's hardships.

177
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,120
That so?

178
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:57,970
So this is...

179
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,210
Sukuna's vessel, huh?

180
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,890
I can take him apart as I please, right?

181
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,640
Make sure to get good use out of him.

182
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,980
Oh, I will.

183
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,370
Who do you think I am?

184
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,510
"Live a long life"?

185
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,300
Doesn't mean much when
you go and die yourself.

186
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,970
Is this your first time having a partner die?

187
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,430
First time for one my age.

188
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,990
You seem to be taking it well, considering.

189
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,520
Same to you.

190
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,820
Of course.

191
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:39,270
I only knew him for about two weeks.

192
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:45,350
I'm not some simple woman who breaks down
bawling when a guy I barely know dies.

193
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,890
Jeez.

194
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,450
It's hot, huh?

195
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,340
Yeah. Wonder if it's time for summer uniforms.

196
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,400
What's this?

197
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,040
You're looking more glum than usual, Megumi.

198
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,480
This a wake or something?

199
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,270
Zenin-senpai.

200
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,300
Don't call me by my last name!

201
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,500
Maki! Maki!

202
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,900
I'm talking here.

203
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,900
Y-You actually don't know why they're so down?

204
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,270
What are you talking about?

205
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,500
Someone really did die yesterday!

206
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,860
One of the first-year boys!

207
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,770
Bonito flakes.

208
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,790
You should've told me sooner!

209
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:47,040
Now I look like some heartless,
cold-blooded demon!

210
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,510
That's exactly how you came off.

211
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,560
Tuna and mayo.

212
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,210
You're supposed to try
to make me feel better!

213
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,910
Who are those guys?

214
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,800
Our second-year upperclassmen.

215
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,530
You have to be kinder to your underclassmen.

216
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,420
There's more to kindness
than being soft on them.

217
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,420
Zenin-senpai is the best of all the
students at wielding cursed tools.

218
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,640
Salmon roe.

219
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,150
That's the Cursed Speech
user, Inumaki-senpai.

220
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,440
He can only speak in
ingredients of rice balls.

221
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,390
He's a bit softer when Yuuta's around, though.

222
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,430
Panda-senpai.

223
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:23,230
There's one more, Okkotsu-senpai,
who's the only one I can openly respect,

224
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,220
but he's overseas right now.

225
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,940
You're not adding more
about the panda named Panda?

226
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,230
Man, sorry about this.

227
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,200
And when you're in mourning...

228
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,210
Please forgive us for that.

229
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,770
The truth is, we'd like you to participate
in the Kyoto Sister School Exchange Event.

230
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,120
Kyoto Sister School Exchange Event?

231
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,350
What's that?

232
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,680
It's a get-together with the
other Tech school in Kyoto.

233
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,580
Though isn't that event
mainly second- and third-years?

234
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,400
And those stupid third-years
are suspended right now.

235
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,960
So you need to participate.

236
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,140
What do you do at this event?

237
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,350
Smash Bros.?

238
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,120
I won't lose if it's the Wii version.

239
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,330
I'll Meteor Smash so you can't come back.

240
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,330
Then let's make a 3-man team.

241
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,060
The exchange event has the principals
of the Tokyo and Kyoto schools

242
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:21,590
each propose a form of competition to be held
for an entire day over the course of two days.

243
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,080
Though that's just how it is on paper.

244
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,960
Every year, the first day is team battles,
and the second day is individual battles.

245
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,880
Salmon.

246
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,120
Individual and team battles?

247
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,800
We fight?! Against other jujutsu sorcerers?!

248
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:41,590
Yeah, it's a jujutsu battle
where anything but killing goes.

249
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,030
We'll train you up well
so you won't get killed.

250
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

251
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,470
Wait, do you have time for that?

252
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,930
I thought we were short
on jujutsu sorcerers.

253
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:57,450
That's a good question. For now, we are.

254
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:06,160
Winter Blues

255
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:06,160
Disrupt Autonomic Nerves

256
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:06,160
Change in Environment

257
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:06,160
May Blues

258
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,410
The glum emotions people harbor
from late winter through spring

259
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:05,700
cause an outburst of curses in the
early summer, so that's our busy season.

260
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,690
Sometimes we're busy all year long,

261
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,960
but things should be settling down soon.

262
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,000
Huh...

263
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,920
So, you'll do it, right?

264
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,130
You just had a partner
die on you, after all.

265
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,310
We're in!

266
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,590
I...

267
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:19,790
I...

268
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,320
...have to get stronger.

269
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,310
I'll do anything to achieve that!

270
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:29,660
But if I decide this training and exchange
event is pointless, I'm quitting instantly.

271
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,900
Same here.

272
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,760
Well, people this cocky are
all the more worthwhile to train.

273
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,840
Bonito flakes.

274
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:41,610
Café Restaurant
Rice

275
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,610
So you're saying your boss

276
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,610
wants to reverse the current
positions of humans and curses.

277
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,670
Is that it?

278
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,960
Well, roughly.

279
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,220
It's slightly different, though.

280
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,390
Humans are made up of lies.

281
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:59,870
For every positive action and emotion
they show, there's always a flip-side.

282
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:07,530
Yet negative emotions like hatred and
hostility are truths without falsehood.

283
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,570
Since we curses are born
from those emotions,

284
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:14,770
that makes us true, pure beings!

285
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:17,190
Imitations should be eliminated!

286
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,330
Yet, at present, you're
the ones being eliminated.

287
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,100
That's why we've come to ask you.

288
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,000
What can we do to defeat
the jujutsu sorcerers?

289
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,020
If you fulfill two conditions

290
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:32,160
before going to war, then you can win.

291
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,670
And what are these two conditions?

292
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,180
The first involves the man known
as the strongest jujutsu sorcerer.

293
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,630
You have to render
Gojou Satoru incapable of fighting.

294
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:49,180
The second is to get Ryoumen Sukuna
and Itadori Yuuji on your side.

295
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,730
Hold on. He died, didn't he?

296
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,200
That Itadori Yuuji brat, I mean.

297
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,900
Did he, though? I'm not so sure.

298
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,210
Don't look inside me without
permission. I hate it...

299
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,050
Brat.

300
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,490
Juju Stroll

301
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,490
Salmon.

302
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,220
You stink.

303
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,380
I don't stink.

304
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,230
You stink.

305
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,940
I don't stink!

306
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:00,200
Why are you treating me like an animal?

307
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,480
Because you're a panda.

308
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:02,710
Mustard leaf.

309
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,560
You smell like an animal.

310
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,260
I keep telling you to take
a bath, and you never do.

311
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,810
I don't like getting wet.

312
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:12,920
But unlike you guys, I don't sweat,

313
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,260
and I Febreze every day.

314
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:18,300
So I don't stink.

315
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,110
So that's what happened.

316
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,740
You guys try taking a whiff.

317
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,940
Doesn't really stink.

318
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,220
Sort of smells like the sun.

319
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,080
Sunshine!

320
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:54,950
Episode 6:
After Rain
