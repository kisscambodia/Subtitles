1
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,540
I ended up not doing anything.

2
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,700
I wonder if they'll be mad.

3
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,430
Though in contrast,

4
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,470
you worked too hard.

5
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,770
Poor thing.

6
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,030
Shall I put you out of your misery?

7
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,700
Good work.

8
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,290
You're just a human. Don't act on your own.

9
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,960
Or I'll kill you.

10
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,500
Come on, I'm just being nice.

11
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,960
But I guess a curse wouldn't
understand such subtleties.

12
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,840
So, got the goods?

13
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,770
Without a hitch.

14
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,630
All six of the special-grade
"Sukuna's Finger" cursed objects

15
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,220
that Jujutsu High possessed...

16
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,210
and the other special-grade cursed object,

17
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:30,740
"Cursed Wombs: Death Paintings,"
One through Three.

18
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,240
Most of the temples at Jujutsu High

19
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,480
are actually just a facade.

20
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,700
Tengen's barrier keeps their
position changing every day.

21
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,780
Among those, only one
of over a thousand doors

22
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,050
leads to the storeroom

23
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,830
that holds cursed objects
as dangerous as the fingers.

24
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:01,600
Only Tengen knows which door leads
to the storehouse each day,

25
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,480
so I doubt anyone will interfere.

26
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,750
Who's Tengen?

27
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,190
A jujutsu sorcerer with
an immortality technique.

28
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,220
Immortality?!

29
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,620
Who's stronger, him or Gojo Satoru?!

30
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,100
He has immortality, but not eternal youth.

31
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,990
You can think of him as just a tree.

32
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,940
Tengen basically doesn't
interfere with the world,

33
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,040
aside from maintaining barriers.

34
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,750
You really don't have to worry about him.

35
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:28,000
Remember the finger we let
Jujutsu High retrieve previously?

36
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,600
I placed a charm comprised of Mahito's
cursed energy on it before they collected it.

37
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,520
It's under a single-layer seal,
so they won't remove it.

38
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,200
He'll be able to find it easily.

39
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,930
Any gatekeepers?

40
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:45,710
There are two of Tengen's attendants
between the door and the storeroom,

41
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,840
but they're chumps.

42
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,560
More importantly, before the veil goes down,

43
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,060
I'd like you to thin out the sorcerers standing
by at Jujutsu High as quietly as possible.

44
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,850
We want to reduce the burden on Hanami.

45
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:02,040
Why aren't we sealing
Gojo Satoru within the veil?

46
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:07,040
Because we don't want him to direct his
attention toward Mahito's main mission.

47
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,020
And we need him to exercise
a degree of his full power,

48
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,330
or it won't be a proper test of the veil.

49
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,830
Trapping the students inside
will be more effective.

50
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,240
Is it okay to kill all but Sukuna's vessel?

51
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,900
That's fine, but I wouldn't recommend it.

52
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,750
Sukuna's actions

53
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,320
aren't quite what I had imagined.

54
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,570
This is just my guess,

55
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,080
but I believe one of the students

56
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,430
acts as a land mine for Sukuna.

57
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,890
If we step on that,

58
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,460
then in the worst case, all of our
current plans will be ruined.

59
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,860
We should just kidnap Itadori ahead of time.

60
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,480
He's a pawn we'll be using anyway.

61
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,390
No, Itadori...

62
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,990
or rather, Sukuna himself, is also a bomb.

63
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,220
Both for us and for Jujutsu High.

64
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:09,180
We shouldn't agitate it until
the moment we want more chaos:

65
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,480
October 31st, in Shibuya.

66
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:20,880
We should keep everything we can use
to seal Gojo Satoru in reserve until then.

67
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,130
We'll have a few curse
users accompany us, too,

68
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,130
but Kumiya Juzo...

69
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,600
He's disposable.

70
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,780
He's not the kind of person who can
follow a plan all the way through.

71
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,380
He'll get in our way later.

72
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:41,740
We'll have a different human monitoring
our commissioned test run of the veil,

73
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,410
so get along with them.

74
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,130
Hear that? Get along, Jogo!

75
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:46,970
Hmph!

76
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,810
I'm not going, anyway.

77
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,090
Come on, wake up, Hanami.

78
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,770
Let's go home.

79
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,740
Mahito.

80
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,950
Trying to pump the brakes on
my hostility is incredibly stressful.

81
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,030
You're sounding more
like a curse, too, Hanami.

82
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,830
JUJUTSU KAISEN

83
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,970
Tokyo
Jujutsu
High
School

84
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:51,010
Episode 21: Jujutsu Koshien

85
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,150
Next up are the casualties.

86
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:50,970
Episode 21: Jujutsu Koshien

87
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,970
Three second-grade sorcerers,

88
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,880
one semi-first-grade sorcerer,

89
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,470
five assistant supervisors,

90
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,160
and two cursed storehouse guards.

91
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,340
They're all sorcerers who were
standing by at Jujutsu High

92
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:00,230
and working separately from
Gojo-san and Principal Yaga.

93
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,060
We're waiting on the report from Ieiri-san,

94
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,120
but we're nearly certain it was
the work of the cursed spirit

95
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,820
that Nanami-san encountered before.

96
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,740
Tsk.

97
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,870
Do you think we should share this information
with the students and the other sorcerers?

98
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,180
No.

99
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,910
It's probably better to keep
this among the higher-ups.

100
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:23,330
We don't want to give curse users certainty
that special-grade objects were stolen.

101
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,630
Has the curse user we
captured spilled anything?

102
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,440
It's not hard to get him to talk,

103
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,420
but most of what he says
is irrelevant nonsense.

104
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,540
However, he claims that he
only participated in the attack

105
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:41,280
because he was ordered to as part of a deal.

106
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,300
I wanted to make a coat rack.

107
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,280
That monk promised me that.

108
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,390
I don't know their name.

109
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,530
I couldn't tell if they were a man or woman.

110
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,910
Just a brat with white hair in a bob cut.

111
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,540
An androgynous monk kid with a bob cut?

112
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,120
That ring any bells?

113
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,400
Nope.

114
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,520
We sure he's not spouting bullshit?

115
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,540
Is there any sorcerer skilled
at getting confessions?

116
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,270
How did a cursed spirit and outsiders

117
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,760
get through Tengen-sama's
barriers in the first place?

118
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:16,190
That was probably the work of the
special-grade cursed spirit the students fought.

119
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,820
That one has a unique presence.

120
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,310
Even though it's a cursed spirit,
it's incredibly close to a natural spirit.

121
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:27,310
According to Aoi, it was
able to hide among plants.

122
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,580
And Tengen-sama's barrier
doesn't function against plants.

123
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,500
Tengen-sama's barrier puts all its
power into hiding, not protecting.

124
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,390
So once you get in, it's kind of weak.

125
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,820
Are they worried about Sukuna's
Fingers enhancing Yuji's potential?

126
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,820
Or are they trying to enhance themselves?

127
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,930
Something isn't sitting right.

128
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,560
For now, let's be glad our students are safe.

129
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,840
But it goes without saying that the
exchange event is now canceled.

130
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,110
Hold on.

131
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,570
That's not for us to decide, is it?

132
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,460
When did you start getting
along with that gorilla?

133
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,790
Well, we got along, but like...

134
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:23,180
I remember what happened,
but I wasn't exactly myself then...

135
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,410
What, were you drunk?

136
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,500
You believe I could've been
drinking liquor in that situation?

137
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,460
I'm shocked.

138
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:36,080
But I'm glad you weren't
seriously hurt, Fushiguro.

139
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,960
You're able to eat pizza now, too.

140
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,040
Come on, bring me
something easier to digest.

141
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,980
No complaining.

142
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,890
Apparently, I got off easier because
my cursed energy was all dried up.

143
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:55,230
Ieiri-san was still able to fix me up
as soon as the roots were removed.

144
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,480
Huh, so that's a thing that can happen?

145
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,180
You fought against them, didn't you?

146
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,000
Itadori.

147
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,970
You've grown stronger.

148
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:13,600
Back then, we both said our
convictions were proper ones.

149
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,370
I still think that's true.

150
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:22,220
Or, put another way, we're both wrong.

151
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,340
Huh?

152
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,710
Some questions don't have answers, you know.

153
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,100
You're thinking too hard.

154
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,230
You'll go bald.

155
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,930
That's right. There is no answer.

156
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,490
It's just whether or not you can accept it.

157
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,030
But there's no accepting anything
if you can't have it your way.

158
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,740
Weak sorcerers can't do that.

159
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,000
So I'm going to become strong, too.

160
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,010
I'll surpass you in no time.

161
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,510
You never change.

162
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,260
Don't just move the conversation
forward without me.

163
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,220
That's my brother's friends for you!

164
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:03,490
Where are you going, Brother?!

165
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,730
I'm grateful to you, but give me a break!

166
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,730
I wasn't thinking straight then!

167
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,090
What're you saying?!

168
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,080
We've been so close since
middle school, Brother!

169
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,060
I didn't go to your middle school!

170
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:21,700
Curse

171
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,280
Hello! Useless Miwa here!

172
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,170
Even though I call myself useless,

173
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:31,020
I don't think I'm actually that bad.

174
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,010
But while everyone was risking their lives

175
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,680
fighting during the special-grade
cursed spirit's attack,

176
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,040
I was fast asleep,

177
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,920
and now I feel ashamed.

178
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:48,580
Also, who broke my sword?

179
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,150
Was it Mai's older sister?

180
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,650
Between all that, we thought
the exchange event was canceled,

181
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,290
but after taking a day off,

182
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,950
we're now...

183
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,060
Play ball!

184
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,850
...playing baseball.

185
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,950
JUJUTSU KAISEN

186
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,950
JUJUTSU KAISEN

187
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,210
— One Day Prior —

188
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,210
So anyway,

189
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:21,300
a lot happened and some people died,

190
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,210
but how about it? Want to
continue the exchange event?

191
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,220
I don't know what to say about it...

192
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,220
Obviously...

193
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,220
We're continuing it, of course.

194
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,520
T-Todo!

195
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,520
Your reasons?

196
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,810
First, only those with a connection to
the dead have a right to mourn them.

197
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,150
It's not our place to butt in there.

198
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:48,130
And second, if people have died,

199
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:51,770
that's all the more reason
we need to become stronger.

200
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:55,040
Acquired strength comes from
the accumulation of results.

201
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,530
Tasting defeat and savoring victory

202
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:00,170
is what leads us to grow.

203
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,800
The most important part is
for those results to exist.

204
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,600
Todo-senpai's surprisingly reliable.

205
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,680
Reliably crazy.

206
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,990
Third, when a student feels like they
weren't able to bring out their best,

207
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,400
it hangs over them until they die.

208
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,180
How old are you?

209
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,120
I'm fine with that.

210
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,430
We'll win anyway.

211
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,330
It sounds stupid, but he has a point.

212
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,070
Why don't you rest, Kamo-kun?

213
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,510
No objections here.

214
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,510
Salmon.

215
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,950
Will we draw lots for the
individual battle pair-ups?

216
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,350
Huh?

217
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,320
There are no individual battles this year.

218
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,570
The exchange event has the principals
of the Tokyo and Kyoto schools

219
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,960
each propose a form of competition to be held
for an entire day over the course of two days.

220
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,960
But that's just how it is on paper.

221
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,940
Every year, the first day is team battles,
and the second day is individual battles.

222
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,930
Salmon.

223
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,810
I hate routines, you know.

224
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,140
Every year, we put the
competition methods in this box

225
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,910
and open it on the day of.

226
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:09,660
*Principal Gakuganji's previous visit was to discuss
what items might be needed on the day of the event.

227
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,780
Principal Gakuganji's
previous visit was to discuss

228
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,650
what items might be needed
on the day of the event.

229
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,360
Baseball

230
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,320
Baseball?!

231
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,110
You're here, too?!

232
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,440
What's going on here, Yaga?

233
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,850
No, I know I put individual battles in—

234
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,120
Get back here, Satoru!

235
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,640
Miwa Kasumi

236
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,640
Second Base

237
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,640
The mango she was letting ripen in the refrigerator is gone.

238
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:35,640
Fly ball!

239
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,880
Nishimiya, don't run yet!

240
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,260
Out!

241
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,920
Huh? Why?

242
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,280
If you don't know the rules, then say so!

243
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,900
I know them! When the ball's hit, I run!

244
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,900
Nishimiya Momo

245
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,900
Outfielder

246
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,900
Baseball experience: 2L.

247
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,640
A sacrifice fly?!

248
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,050
What's that, some new form of torture?!

249
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,540
You're just plain stupid!

250
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,660
Kamo Noritoshi

251
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,660
Third batter

252
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,660
Practicing cursive. I can write my own name now.

253
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,110
I heard you fended off a special-grade.

254
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:07,670
Itadori Yuji

255
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:07,670
Catcher

256
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:07,670
First impression of iekei ramen: "I poop a lot the next day."

257
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,030
Huh?

258
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,760
Oh, yeah...

259
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,610
thanks to Todo and Gojo-sensei.

260
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,670
Don't you need a helmet?

261
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,680
Itadori, why are you a jujutsu sorcerer?

262
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,120
At first, it just kinda happened.

263
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,830
But I'm a lonely guy.

264
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,700
I want to save lots of people

265
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,300
and have lots of them
watching over me when I die.

266
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,280
If you're not there, Mother,

267
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,310
I won't become a jujutsu sorcerer!

268
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,340
You have talent, Noritoshi.

269
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,450
You can save lots of people.

270
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,920
The more people you save,

271
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,820
the more you'll be recognized.

272
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,890
Then, in turn, all kinds
of people will help you.

273
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,590
You'll only be alone for now.

274
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,080
One day, once you've
become a great sorcerer,

275
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,500
come get me.

276
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,600
I see.

277
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,420
That's

278
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,190
a good

279
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,360
reason.

280
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,280
Strike!

281
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,420
Batter out!

282
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,340
Change up!

283
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,020
Kamo! You won't get a hit if you don't swing!

284
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,270
Kyoto

285
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,270
Tokyo

286
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,800
They call me the Mah-kun of Tohoku.

287
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,800
Kugisaki Nobara

288
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,800
Third Base

289
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,800
Awaiting approval for a credit card. Too hard for a high schooler, maybe?

290
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,180
No, Mah-kun is the Mah-kun of Tohoku.

291
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,730
Mah-kun's a pitcher, you know!

292
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,060
Bonito flakes.

293
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,790
Huh?

294
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,660
Mechamaru

295
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,250
Hold on!

296
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,550
Kugisaki's snapped!

297
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,740
It's a free-for-all!

298
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,200
That's obviously a pitching machine!

299
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,430
What are you talking about?

300
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,730
It's a spare. A spare Mechamaru.

301
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,930
Mechamaru

302
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,920
We don't have a choice, since your
Panda broke him the other day.

303
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,920
Pitching machine?

304
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:48,820
Zen'in Mai

305
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:48,820
First Base

306
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:48,820
Hated mangoes, but got over it recently.

307
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,490
I don't understand.

308
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,480
You know a lot about machines.

309
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,820
Are you an otaku?

310
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,600
It's just one thing after another with you!

311
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,440
And yet somehow you're
still a Jujutsu High student!

312
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,960
Fine, I'll do this!

313
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,010
Oh, she got on base.

314
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:03,350
She's desperate.

315
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,540
Fushiguro Megumi

316
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,540
Outfielder

317
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,540
Prefers breast meat in chicken nanban and thigh meat in oyakodon.

318
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,590
Out.

319
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,600
Panda

320
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,600
First Base

321
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,600
Wants to punch a zebra someday.

322
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,020
Zen'in Maki

323
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,020
Pitcher

324
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,020
The one thing she can't tolerate is protein powder.

325
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:30,920
Tsk.

326
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,280
Mechamaru

327
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,680
Okay, that's three.

328
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,980
That's cheating!

329
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,150
Bonito flakes!

330
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,560
Kugisaki, go back.

331
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,070
Due to lack of players, one outfielder is permitted to use cursed techniques.

332
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,060
Kyoto
Tokyo

333
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,070
Catcher, huh?

334
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:25,580
Todo Aoi

335
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:25,580
Catcher

336
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:25,580
Won the middle school nationals with Itadori. Itadori denies this.

337
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,120
Catching, throwing, leading, fielding, etc.

338
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:25,580
One could call it a fitting
position for my brother.

339
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,080
But what I desire is a face-off
with Pitcher Itadori.

340
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,590
Todo...

341
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,180
You could have been their pitcher.

342
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,090
He can't.

343
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:39,010
Mechamaru can't do anything
but pitch right now.

344
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,410
Promise me, Brother.

345
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,290
If I hit a home run at bat this time,

346
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,430
next time you'll pi—

347
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,960
Intentional

348
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,760
T-Todo!

349
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,060
Hang in there!

350
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,740
Nice pitch!

351
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,400
Nice pitch!

352
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,070
Nice pitch!

353
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,820
Maki-san, nice pitch!

354
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,820
Nice pitch!

355
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:17,540
Nice pitch!

356
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,580
Todo,

357
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,580
everyone

358
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,870
really hates you!

359
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,880
Do you still hate Itadori?

360
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,610
It's not a matter of liking or hating him.

361
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:29,130
Itadori isn't allowed to
exist under jujutsu laws.

362
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:32,170
He's only alive due to Gojo's selfishness.

363
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:36,520
We must not bend the rules
of the group for the individual.

364
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:42,150
Moreover, many others may
die because Itadori lives.

365
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,740
But there are lives that
were saved thanks to him, too.

366
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,910
Case in point, he worked together
with Todo to fend off the special-grade.

367
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,350
This doesn't apply to just our students,

368
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:58,160
but they're going to stack up
many regrets as time goes on.

369
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,830
"I wish I had done that."

370
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,510
"I wish they'd done this."

371
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,370
"I should have said that."

372
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,230
"I wish someone had told me this."

373
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:15,220
To be honest with you, I don't know
what the right decision is with Itadori.

374
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,060
But for now, let's just watch over him.

375
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,840
Oh, he made it!

376
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,230
Inumaki-senpai's a fast runner.

377
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,740
Salted roe.

378
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,750
Inumaki Toge

379
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,750
Second Base

380
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,750
Prefers bread for breakfast. Likes it with ham, cheese, and a bit of tabasco.

381
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,500
Mai! Miwa!

382
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,100
Watch for base-stealing!

383
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,500
We can save our regrets

384
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,750
for after that.

385
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,310
He nailed it.

386
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,150
Yeah!

387
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:16,290
Winner: Tokyo

388
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:16,290
30th Annual Exchange Event

389
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:16,290
Kyoto

390
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:16,290
Tokyo

391
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:16,290
Second Day's Baseball Competition

392
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:16,290
Sister School Exchange Event

393
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,080
Yaga, do something about Gojo first.

394
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:57,430
Juju Stroll

395
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,430
Salmon.

396
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,060
Q: Rice or bread?

397
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,720
Rice?

398
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:07,030
Q: Are you a rice person or a bread person?

399
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,560
No, I like bread, too...

400
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,030
Wait, is it served with roe?

401
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,650
Q: Are you a rice person or a bread person?

402
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,650
Rice.

403
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,190
Rice, I think?

404
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:12,660
Q: Are you a rice person or a bread person?

405
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,660
What? I definitely prefer bread.

406
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,490
Q: Are you a rice person or a bread person?

407
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,490
Salted rice ball.

408
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:17,830
Obviously bread, because I'm a panda!

409
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:19,870
Q: Are you a rice person or a bread person?

410
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,870
You want me to kill you?!

411
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,250
This one's...

412
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,480
kind of forced...

413
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,740
They're out of ideas.

414
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,890
We're going home.

415
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:39,930
