1
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,240
I'm going, Nanamin.

2
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:13,750
You can't.

3
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,860
I already explained why this morning.

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,450
If a veil has been cast,

5
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:25,200
there's a strong likelihood he's both
alive and at Satozakura High School.

6
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,230
I'll be back soon.

7
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,980
Please wait there, Itadori-kun.

8
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,930
It's probably pointless to ask him that.

9
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,470
You heard why, so I'll leave
the rest of this to you, Ino-kun.

10
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,430
Huh?!

11
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,150
Is there a problem with that?

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,780
Well, the number of them...

13
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,910
There's a lot.

14
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,490
And they're all humans, right?

15
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:00,550
I wouldn't mind taking on the recommendation
to make you a grade 1 jujutsu sorcerer.

16
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,410
Let's get this done, baby! Yeah!

17
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,550
Please step aside, Ijichi-san.

18
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,560
Our job is to help others.

19
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,680
That includes those who are
still students, like yourself.

20
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,110
I won't make any more mistakes.

21
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,320
You must not go, Itadori-kun.

22
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,720
Sorry, Ijichi-san.

23
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,560
What are you doing, Junpei?!

24
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,580
Stay out of this, jujutsu sorcerer.

25
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:13,980
JUJUTSU KAISEN

26
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:34,480
Episode 12:  To You, Someday

27
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,860
Moon Dregs!

28
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,270
A jellyfish shikigami?

29
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,710
Blunt attacks won't work
when he's inside it?

30
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,650
I'll say it one more time.

31
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,640
Stay out of this, jujutsu sorcerer!

32
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,180
It's none of your business!

33
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,190
That's not something you get to decide!

34
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,820
What's the point of indiscriminate salvation?

35
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,180
Don't mistake the value of a life!

36
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,130
People pretend their
emotions are everything,

37
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,850
but the heart is just the
metabolism of the soul.

38
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,070
It's all a delusion!

39
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,800
Don't restrict me with rules
that are based on a delusion.

40
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,930
No one has the right to stop anyone
from taking what lives they can.

41
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,640
Just sleep over there.

42
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,420
There's something I have to go back and do.

43
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,140
Your cursed technique is poison.

44
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,980
You produce poison from cursed energy

45
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,630
and make your shikigami
secrete it from its tentacles.

46
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,020
You'll learn to control

47
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,180
the size and strength of your shikigami,
as well as the potency of your poison.

48
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,590
A normal jujutsu sorcerer would
need some time to grasp it,

49
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,350
but I'll teach you the sensation,

50
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,240
so you'll be able to fight right away.

51
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,160
Junpei, you have talent.

52
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,950
Who are you making excuses for?

53
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,740
Why?

54
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,120
Why won't Moon Dregs' poison work on him?

55
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,180
Why are you getting in my way?

56
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,160
Why?!

57
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:49,950
Why?!

58
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,700
Why?!

59
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,350
He's in the air! He can't move!

60
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,010
No... if there's a chance to crush him,
it's right before he lands!

61
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,530
Junpei, I don't understand...

62
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,220
a damn thing you're saying!

63
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,410
You can string together
whatever logic you want.

64
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,660
When facing shikigami users,
strike the sorcerer directly.

65
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,660
You're just trying...

66
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,830
to convince yourself you're in the right!

67
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,900
I don't know what your motive is.
I'm sure you have a reason for doing this.

68
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:52,010
But is it really worth

69
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,470
throwing away that life you have?

70
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,420
The human heart is a delusion?

71
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,280
Can you say that in front of her?!

72
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,220
People don't have hearts.

73
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,040
You're still—

74
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,020
They don't!

75
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,770
Otherwise...

76
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,610
Otherwise...

77
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:22,270
That would mean people cursed me
and my mom with those hearts!

78
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,170
That would just be too much...

79
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,220
I wouldn't know what is right

80
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,310
or what is wrong anymore...

81
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,050
Why didn't you dodge it?

82
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:52,450
Sorry.

83
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,240
I said a lot of self-important stuff
without understanding anything.

84
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,840
Tell me what happened.

85
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,340
I swear I won't curse you anymore.

86
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:11,590
So please.

87
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,780
No way... Your mom...

88
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,670
Junpei, come to Jujutsu Tech.

89
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,720
There are lots of crazy strong teachers
and reliable friends there.

90
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:39,940
If we all work together,

91
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,050
I'm sure we can find
whoever cursed your mom.

92
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,940
Then you can make sure they get their due!

93
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,380
Let's fight together!

94
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,260
Who are you?

95
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,110
Who is that?

96
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:01,990
A person?

97
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,610
Nice to meet you...

98
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,480
No, this feels like...

99
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,570
...vessel of Sukuna.

100
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,240
Mahito-san, wait!

101
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,260
Am I an idiot?!

102
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,430
A human-shaped cursed spirit
with a patchwork face!

103
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,160
This is exactly what
Nanamin said would happen!

104
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,310
Junpei, run!

105
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,670
I don't know what
relationship you have with him,

106
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,050
but right now, just run!

107
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,460
Please!

108
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,730
Itadori-kun, please calm down!

109
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,020
Mahito-san's not a bad person...

110
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,600
Bad... person...

111
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,950
You know, Junpei, you've got
a good head on your shoulders.

112
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:01,380
But sometimes deliberation can lead
to worse foolishness than imprudence.

113
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,970
You're a stereotypical case of that!

114
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,760
You're almost as foolish as

115
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,670
those people you call fools yourself.

116
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,130
That's why you'll die.

117
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,600
Idle Transfiguration.

118
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,500
Now, time for round two.

119
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,370
Junpei...

120
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,820
Junpei!

121
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,680
Get a hold of yourself!

122
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,350
I'll heal you right now!

123
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,330
Sukuna!

124
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,780
Sukuna!

125
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,340
What?

126
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,640
I'll do anything!

127
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,440
You can do anything you want with me!

128
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,790
So heal Junpei like you did
when you restored my heart!

129
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,270
I refuse!

130
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,410
Damn you...

131
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,780
Good.

132
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,830
He's completely forgotten about that pact.

133
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,580
How very amusing!

134
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,220
You'd offer up your pride,

135
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,600
your future, your everything,
to try to rely on me...

136
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,680
And you can't save anything!

137
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,820
He refused the pact?

138
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:43,200
The shape of one's soul isn't something that
reverse cursed techniques could deal with...

139
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:47,060
Maybe healing others is beyond him?

140
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,610
Pathetic!

141
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,770
You couldn't be more pathetic, brat!

142
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,210
Though, what I'm after is what comes next,

143
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,070
so I guess this is fine.

144
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,550
Oh, that's right.

145
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,340
At the end of the day,

146
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,470
these two are both

147
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,810
curses.

148
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,140
Yuuji...

149
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,990
Why?

150
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,880
Oh, dead already?

151
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,420
I suppose I was kind of rough
when I changed his shape.

152
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,820
Guess that's how it goes.

153
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,420
That was an unusual blow.

154
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,760
Interesting!

155
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,290
Too bad, though.

156
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:32,760
That won't work. So long
as I maintain the shape of my—

157
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,130
What's going on?!

158
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,960
He struck the shape of my soul, as well?

159
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,940
That's right!

160
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,270
Itadori Yuuji's a vessel.

161
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:54,130
His body constantly houses another
soul in addition to his own.

162
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,580
So naturally...

163
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,550
You're aware...

164
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,430
of the outline of your soul?

165
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,930
The next words that spilled from my lips

166
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:16,500
came from so deep within
my gut that it nearly made

167
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,730
all the things I've ever said feel like a lie.

168
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,280
I will kill you!

169
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,960
JUJUTSU KAISEN

170
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,970
JUJUTSU KAISEN

171
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:46,790
Don't you mean you'll
"exorcise" me, jujutsu sorcerer?

172
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,460
Itadori Yuuji isn't concerned
with his own life.

173
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:58,260
Getou forbade me from forcing him
into an external pact using hostages.

174
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,570
So if he can't kill a foe he hates
so much that he longs to kill them,

175
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,790
he'll probably turn to Sukuna.

176
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,780
If Junpei isn't enough,

177
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,100
I'd just need to transform every
student, one by one, before his eyes.

178
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,650
That would lead Itadori Yuuji to negotiate
and forge a pact with Sukuna

179
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,180
while he's full of hatred for self-interest.

180
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:26,190
If that also improved the chances of
Sukuna joining our side, all the better.

181
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:34,870
Though, all of that presumes
that I'm stronger than him.

182
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,080
So why did he have to be

183
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,850
my natural enemy?

184
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,950
He keeps changing his damn shape so much!

185
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:04,380
Would it be better to stop thinking of
combos that start with holds and throws?

186
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,670
Now that I know his attacks work on me,

187
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:11,320
changing my shape and making
his target bigger is a bad idea.

188
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,090
In that case...

189
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,370
Even if it takes a hundred or a thousand times,

190
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,830
I'll keep pounding him

191
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,470
into a pulp!

192
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:28,560
I'll use a shape more honed toward murder,

193
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,800
with more inspiration for murder,

194
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,930
and manifest it!

195
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,040
You can't keep stretching forever!

196
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,100
Most people would let go, you know.

197
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:28,880
Spreading my shape too much causes it
to lose strength and maneuverability.

198
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,970
You can't beat me.

199
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,570
Swap out already...

200
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,590
with Sukuna.

201
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,190
Idle Transfiguration.

202
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,220
You dare touch my soul?

203
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,010
Since we both heartily ridiculed
that brat together,

204
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,680
I'll allow it once.

205
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,210
There won't be a second time.

206
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,770
Know your place,

207
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,100
fool.

208
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,970
I'm not swapping out.

209
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,540
I already told you...

210
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,340
I will kill you.

211
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:23,360
Huh?

212
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:35,890
Nanamin!

213
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,860
I'll lecture you later.

214
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,140
Tell me the situation.

215
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,480
I couldn't save two people.

216
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,040
It's always others first?

217
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:56,370
Explain your physical state first.

218
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,550
I'm fine.

219
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,870
Though I'm full of holes.

220
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,130
That's not fine.

221
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:07,600
Also, everyone from this school
is unconscious in the gym.

222
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,750
Hey, you're alive and well, 7:3 sorcerer!

223
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,290
Glad to see we both survived.

224
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,280
Shall we share a hug,

225
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,160
in celebration of our reunion?

226
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,590
Itadori-kun, why is his nose bleeding?

227
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,680
Huh? I punched him.

228
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,100
When?

229
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,550
At the start of our fight.

230
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,370
Did his hand touch you?

231
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,360
Yeah.

232
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,250
My attacks won't work on him.

233
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:42,790
Huh?!

234
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,800
What?! Why?!

235
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,900
I'll explain while I'm lecturing you.

236
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,260
One, his technique doesn't
work on Itadori-kun,

237
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:54,790
or two, there's some reason
he won't kill Itadori-kun.

238
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,720
Either way, that's good for us.

239
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,460
However, I can halt his movements.

240
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,650
Once we've both created an opening,
we'll shower him with blows.

241
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,530
We'll make sure to exorcise him here.

242
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:12,800
Yeah!

243
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,550
Juju Stroll

244
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:55,030
Episode 13:
Tomorrow
