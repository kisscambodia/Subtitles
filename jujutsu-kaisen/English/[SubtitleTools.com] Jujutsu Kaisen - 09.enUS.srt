1
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,240
He was totally ogling my breasts!

2
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:16,540
She does have a huge rack,
so they bounce when she runs.

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,330
I get why you'd do it, Yoshino-chan.

4
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,960
If there was a button that
would make everyone I hate die,

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,810
I probably wouldn't push it.

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,450
Gross!

7
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:31,270
But if there was a button that would
make everyone who hated me die,

8
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,490
Shut up, you guys.

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,260
I'd push it without hesitation.

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,890
Human Earthworm 3

11
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,890
Creating Humans

12
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,240
Excuse me.

13
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,270
Excuse me.

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,280
Excuse me!

15
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,550
One adult for Human Earthworm 3.

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,900
That'll be 1,800 yen.

17
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,650
Yeah, here.

18
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,560
The show will be starting soon.

19
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:11,050
I served as a doctor for many years,
working to save lives.

20
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,680
And it turned out he had 50,000 on him!
A middle school brat!

21
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:15,810
As I was saving countless lives, I found
myself arriving at a particular question.

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,890
For real?

23
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,410
This sucks.

24
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:15,810
That's awesome.

25
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:21,390
Where does a person's life—
their very soul—actually reside?

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,470
So? What'd you do next?

27
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,790
High schoolers shouldn't
skip school to watch movies.

28
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,220
I took it all.

29
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,030
Man, so mean!

30
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,030
Not that I can talk.

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,760
That's when I realized it!

32
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,550
This seriously sucks.

33
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,210
The shape of one's soul creates the body!

34
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,990
Then today's your treat!

35
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,830
I can't hear the movie at all.

36
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,710
Screw that.

37
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,200
So I began conducting research on the soul.

38
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,090
We're splitting it even, obviously!

39
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,670
There are always people like that,
even if they vary to some degree.

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,670
All alone, in this lab deep in the mountains...

41
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,700
So, were you looking?

42
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,660
I wasn't.

43
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:45,430
Then are you saying Tsubasa's lying to us?

44
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,510
He was definitely looking at them!

45
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,890
You're nuts, man!

46
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,850
Oh, there's a half-off coupon.

47
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:52,980
Huh? To where?

48
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,040
Hey! Teach him a lesson first!

49
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,970
Shit.

50
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:01,470
That woman's just using me to see
where she stands, and she's enjoying it!

51
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,920
You were looking, then.

52
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,990
Damn it.

53
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,290
I'll tell her!

54
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,210
I'll tell her!

55
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,400
I'll tell her!

56
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,460
I'll tell her!

57
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,670
You're not as cute as you
think you are, Tsubasa-san.

58
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,380
These three know that, too.

59
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,240
The only reason they're fawning over you is

60
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,310
because they think you'll let them bang you.

61
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,950
Now to create the perfect human being!

62
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,640
No way.

63
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,640
She won't let us bang her at all.

64
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,970
She's no good anymore.

65
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:35,960
Stop talking.

66
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,470
S-Stop it!

67
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,350
No!

68
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,240
It's Tsubasa.

69
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,240
Turn off your phone!

70
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,240
Hello?

71
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,610
What's up?

72
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,260
Right now? I'm free.

73
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,570
You three...

74
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,290
Well...

75
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,280
need to mind your manners.

76
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,470
There's no need to worry.

77
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,480
Everything went well.

78
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,760
It's all for the creation of
the perfect human being...

79
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,210
Human Earthworm 3

80
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,210
Creating Humans

81
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,690
Wha...

82
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,420
What is this?

83
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,870
That person just now...

84
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,070
No, a person couldn't do this.

85
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,920
And if they could, would they really

86
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,430
be human?

87
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,170
Monday, 10:10 AM

88
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,860
What if I am the one who did it?

89
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,000
Will you condemn me?

90
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,920
Were those three special to you?

91
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,450
Don't worry.

92
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,830
He can eat it.

93
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,450
Harsh, man!

94
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,680
Poor guy! He's crying now!

95
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,200
Can I...

96
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,650
do that, too?

97
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:53,010
JUJUTSU KAISEN

98
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,010
Please stay back!

99
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:13,430
Episode 9:  Small Fry and Reverse Retribution

100
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,300
It seems like the victims
were high school students.

101
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:22,860
Monday 10:30 AM

102
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,880
Who were those guys?!

103
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,040
Why were they on the scene before forensics?!

104
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,360
One of them was just a kid, too!

105
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,950
I don't know the details, either.

106
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,830
But you saw those stiffs, didn't you?

107
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,490
That's not something a person could do.

108
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,220
Just pretend you never saw it...

109
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,420
If you want to reach retirement
in this line of work, that is.

110
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,110
Can you see it?

111
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,270
This is the residual taint of cursed energy.

112
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,360
No, I can't see anything.

113
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,920
That's because you're not trying to see it.

114
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,110
We typically see curses as
if it's perfectly natural to.

115
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,140
When a cursed technique is used,
it leaves traces behind.

116
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,460
That's what residuals are.

117
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,920
But residuals are much
fainter than cursed spirits.

118
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,440
So focus your vision and look closely.

119
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,120
Oh!

120
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,610
I can see them!

121
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:19,890
Of course you can.

122
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,160
A proper sorcerer can sense them
before seeing them.

123
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,870
Couldn't you give me a little
more praise or something?

124
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,030
I don't praise or disparage anyone.

125
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,720
I adhere to facts and judge on that basis.

126
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,370
That's who I am.

127
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:40,340
There was a time when I mistakenly
believed society operated the same way,

128
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,190
but enough about that.

129
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,220
Let's follow them.

130
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,080
Yeah! Let's go all-out!

131
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,960
No, where moderate effort
will suffice, use moderate effort.

132
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,890
Let's go.

133
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,710
We're just not clicking.

134
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,640
I'm not getting anything from him.

135
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,920
I won't be able to lead you this time.

136
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:04,330
But don't worry. I've called
in a friend you can trust.

137
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,480
This is Nanami Kento,
the ex-salaryman jujutsu sorcerer!

138
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,510
Please don't call me that.

139
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,150
Plenty of jujutsu sorcerers are oddballs,

140
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:17,820
but since he worked for a company,
he's got a good head on his shoulders.

141
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,820
He's a first-grade sorcerer, too.

142
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,020
I'm sure no one would want to
hear you saying that about them.

143
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,460
A lot of these people wear sunglasses
and stuff to hide their eyes.

144
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:31,280
Ex-salaryman? Why didn't you become
a jujutsu sorcerer from the start?

145
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,600
We should greet each other first.

146
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,700
Nice to meet you, Itadori-kun.

147
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,140
Oh, yes, nice to meet you, too.

148
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,120
I studied at Jujutsu Tech,
and one thing I learned...

149
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,960
is that jujutsu sorcerers are shit!

150
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,730
Huh?

151
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,060
Then I worked at your typical company,
and one thing I learned

152
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,680
is that work is shit!

153
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,860
Really?!

154
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,240
If both are equally shit,
I'll take the one I'm more suited to.

155
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,840
That's the only reason I came back.

156
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,170
That's dark.

157
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,200
Right?

158
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:06,740
Itadori-kun, please don't believe
I'm of the same mindset as Gojou-san.

159
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,990
I do trust and have faith in him,

160
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,510
but I do not respect him!

161
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,400
Huh?!

162
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,790
I hate the way the higher-ups do things,

163
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,000
but I believe in rules and regulations.

164
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,480
This conversation is dragging on.

165
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,850
In short, I don't recognize
you as a sorcerer, either.

166
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,380
Even if you do carry the
bomb we know as Sukuna,

167
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,730
please make an effort to
prove that you are useful.

168
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,050
Lately, I've been forced to realize
how weak and useless I am.

169
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,240
But I'll become strong.

170
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,980
I have to be strong, or I won't
be able to choose how I die.

171
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,290
I'll make you recognize me,
even without that advice.

172
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,060
Just give me a bit more time.

173
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,380
Say that to the higher-ups, not me.

174
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,370
Oh, right.

175
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,500
Frankly, I don't care!

176
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,830
Okay, I get it!

177
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,720
There wasn't anything on the
surveillance cameras, right?

178
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,840
Right. There was only one young
man aside from the victims.

179
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,840
Then a cursed spirit was behind it?

180
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,630
Well, most likely.

181
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,890
There's a small chance the
young man could have done it,

182
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,520
but identifying him is the police's—

183
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:37,120
Lu, lu, lu, lunchbox!

184
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:38,530
Stop.

185
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,140
I'll take care of this one.

186
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,250
You handle the one over there.

187
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:49,390
Good detergent!

188
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:52,080
If you decide you can't beat it, please call me.

189
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,900
Aren't you taking me a bit too lightly here?

190
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,540
It's not a matter of underestimating you or not.

191
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,560
I am an adult, and you are a child.

192
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:05,610
I have a duty to prioritize
your life over my own.

193
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,610
Lu, lu, lu...

194
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,390
I'd rather you underestimate me
than treat me like a kid.

195
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,540
You've faced several life-or-death situations.

196
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,300
But that does not make you an adult.

197
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,410
Finding more fallen-out hairs on your pillow,

198
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,840
watching your favorite stuffed bread
disappear from the convenience store...

199
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,680
The accumulation of those little despairs

200
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,380
is what makes a person an adult.

201
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,000
JUJUTSU KAISEN

202
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,010
JUJUTSU KAISEN

203
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,100
Monday, 11:15 AM

204
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:53,940
My cursed technique allows me to forcibly
create a weak point on any opponent.

205
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,820
Seven to three.

206
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,420
Striking the point at that ratio

207
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:02,960
when you draw a line along the
target's length causes a critical hit.

208
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:08,640
That allows me to deal a fair amount of
damage to those ranked higher than me,

209
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,850
and if their cursed energy is weak,
I can cut them in two, even with a blunt blade.

210
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,440
Are you listening, Itadori-kun?

211
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,310
Huh?! You were talking to me?!

212
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,670
Home run!

213
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,850
Ow...

214
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,670
Is it okay to reveal something like that?

215
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,530
It's no problem to reveal that
technique to that opponent.

216
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:37,440
Also, all the better if
revealing it misleads them.

217
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,670
I want to focus on the curse,
but it feels like I should be listening.

218
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,870
There is merit to it.

219
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:46,630
"Revealing one's hand" is a pact that increases
the effectiveness of one's technique.

220
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,380
Like so.

221
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,830
That's all from me.

222
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,180
Wow.

223
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,010
Not only is the blade he used all wrapped up,

224
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,130
but he used the back of it to
slice right through that thing.

225
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,060
Itadori-kun, behind you.

226
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,630
Huh?

227
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,950
I don't like you looking away.

228
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,120
Who's the one distracting me here?!

229
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,510
Detergent!

230
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,540
Your cursed energy comes
up a little slow, huh?

231
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,190
Ow...

232
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,530
Slow?

233
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,160
Your cursed energy can't keep up
with your explosive power.

234
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,770
You're still not good at amassing
cursed energy, so it tends to lag behind.

235
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:13,300
But that actually creates an
irregular flow of cursed energy.

236
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:18,150
The moment after your fist strikes,
your cursed energy slams in.

237
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:22,170
In other words, you're creating
two impacts with every strike.

238
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,750
Divergent Fist

239
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,750
Divergent Fist!

240
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,360
That's so cool!

241
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,310
It's not something many can do on purpose.

242
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,830
This'll be a great weapon for you.

243
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,660
His raw strength is superhuman?

244
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,850
The initial blow has little cursed energy,

245
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:59,680
but it reaches 120% of
an average sorcerer's power.

246
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:03,210
Then the real blow of cursed energy flows in.

247
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,720
It must be unimaginably unpleasant
for those struck by it.

248
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,150
He has room to grow, too.

249
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:14,890
If he can learn to imbue 100% of his
cursed energy into 100% of his martial arts...

250
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,340
Now I see why that man brought him to me.

251
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,100
L-Lu...

252
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,980
Oh, pardon me. I'll end you now.

253
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,400
Itadori-kun! Don't finish it off yet!

254
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,570
Have a look a this.

255
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,440
I took a photo of my opponent.

256
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,390
Huh? I thought cursed spirits
didn't show up in photos.

257
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,210
Please listen calmly.

258
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,140
What we've been fighting...

259
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,720
They're human.

260
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:54,020
No, I guess I should call them former humans.

261
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,470
They're the same as the three from the theater.

262
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,080
The structure of their bodies was
forcibly altered by a cursed technique.

263
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,050
If that was all, I would
have noticed at the start.

264
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:08,000
The two we fought were full of
cursed energy, like cursed spirits.

265
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,010
You'll have to ask the culprit about
their cursed technique to explain that.

266
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,760
Though there is evidence that their
brain stems were tampered with,

267
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,850
most likely to create a state of confusion
and impaired consciousness.

268
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,530
If they can tamper with the brain,

269
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:25,330
it might be possible for them to modify
someone to be able to use cursed energy.

270
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:29,650
The relationship between the brain
and cursed energy is still a black box to us.

271
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,930
Oh, right, is Itadori listening?

272
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,360
Oh, yeah.

273
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:41,020
To sum it up, these guys died of shock
from having their bodies modified.

274
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,250
You didn't kill them.

275
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,820
So don't get the wrong idea about that.

276
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,410
Right.

277
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,730
Ieiri Shouko

278
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,230
Ieiri Shouko

279
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:55,680
Either way, the deaths of these two
weigh on me just as heavily.

280
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,420
That said, this thing...

281
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,530
has disgusting taste.

282
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:07,040
This boy can get sincerely
angry on another's behalf.

283
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:12,410
Those residuals were a bluff,
likely meant to lure us in.

284
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,710
Our foe is quite skilled.

285
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,740
It looks like this will take
more than moderate effort.

286
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,880
So let's go all-out.

287
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:23,340
Yeah!

288
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:29,770
There are cursed spirits known as
special-grade potential apparitions.

289
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,520
Monday, 11:00 AM

290
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:34,570
Cursed spirits are a collection of the
cursed energy emitted by humans.

291
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,870
Whether it actually exists or not,

292
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:42,640
a shared image of fear makes it easy
for a powerful curse to manifest.

293
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,310
Complete Guide to
Japanese Apparitions

294
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:46,020
A shared image of fear?

295
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,560
You mean like famous monsters
and ghost stories?

296
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:50,790
Yup.

297
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,800
Toilet-bound Hanako-san

298
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,800
Giant Skeleton

299
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,800
Nine-tailed Fox

300
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:54,480
Like Toilet-bound Hanako-san,
the nine-tailed fox, and so on.

301
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:58,620
Jujutsu sorcerers have registered them
as special-grade potential apparitions

302
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,960
and keep an eye out for them.

303
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,940
The fact that they often categorize
powerful, unidentified curses

304
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:09,860
as potential apparitions makes it feel
like that's all they're focused on.

305
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:15,200
But people constantly fear more
than just those fairy tales, right?

306
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,790
Like natural disasters?

307
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,710
I love how stress-free talking to you is.

308
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,530
No, I'm not...

309
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,800
People...

310
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:41,340
have always feared the earth,
the forests, and the oceans.

311
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:46,560
Because the cursed energy directed
toward those is far too big,

312
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,060
they gained wisdom before they took shape
and remained in hiding up until now.

313
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:56,020
I'm proud to call them all friends.

314
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,960
What kind of curse are you, Mahito-san?

315
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:05,600
A human one.

316
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:13,780
I'm a curse that was born from the hatred and
fear people hold in their gut toward others.

317
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:21,590
Tokyo Municipal
Shuuei High School
Detached Office

318
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:20,760
I've organized the reports from our windows

319
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:21,590
Monday 6:25 PM

320
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,660
on recent residuals, unnatural deaths,
and disappearances.

321
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,700
This should help us narrow down
the culprit's hideout to some extent.

322
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,630
Aw yeah! Are we storming in?!

323
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,120
No, it's still only to some extent.

324
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,600
While I continue investigating this matter,
I'd like you to handle a different task.

325
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,880
This is the boy who was at
the theater, Yoshino Junpei.

326
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:44,980
Apparently, he goes to the same
high school as the victims.

327
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,500
Based on the surveillance footage
and how he carried himself,

328
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,430
I believed it was unlikely
he could be a curse user.

329
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:58,310
However, if he's related to the
victims, that changes things.

330
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,770
Curse user?

331
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:02,390
An evil jujutsu sorcerer.

332
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:08,010
I've entrusted the process to Ijichi-kun, so I'd
like you two to investigate Yoshino Junpei.

333
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,590
Sure!

334
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:13,580
Speaking of which, I don't know
any assistants other than you.

335
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:19,040
Well, I'm the only one who knows
you're still alive, so by necessity...

336
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,040
Makes sense.

337
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,230
Let's go!

338
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,910
You already know the location of the culprit,
don't you? And not just "to some extent."

339
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,720
Of course.

340
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:39,450
If the culprit had wanted, he could have
left the scene without leaving any residuals.

341
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,840
We're being lured in once again.

342
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:48,240
Weighing the risk of storming in alone
against the risk of taking Itadori-kun with me,

343
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,300
I simply chose the former.

344
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,820
He's still a child, after all.

345
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,740
Nanami-sensei!

346
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,580
Itadori-kun?

347
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,820
I forgot to say something.

348
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,860
Be careful, okay?

349
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,830
Itadori-kun...

350
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,680
I'm not a teacher, so please
don't call me "Sensei."

351
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,480
Nanamin, then!

352
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,650
I will slap you.

353
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,370
There he is.

354
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,520
Huh? Casual clothes?

355
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,960
It looks like he hasn't
attended school for some time.

356
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,090
For Pedestrians
and Bicycles Only

357
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,710
We'll get out of the car here.

358
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,510
Let's go.

359
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,580
Juju Stroll

360
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,100
Nanami! Let's go out together!

361
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,550
No, thank you.

362
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,940
No, s-seriously, I have something
important to talk to you about.

363
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,030
Oh, how awful.

364
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,350
I haven't said anything yet!

365
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,260
Satoru♥

366
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,300
Satoru♥

367
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,100
To Nanami

368
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,600
Penis

369
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,100
Penis

370
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:55,030
