1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:09,210
Episode 20: Nonstandard

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,410
In third grade,

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,620
I beat up a cocky high schooler.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,220
Handwriting

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,220
Fun to Learn
Arithmetic

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,220
Japanese

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,620
Even if he was older, cocky is still cocky.

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,730
He mocked me.

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,710
And when I feel mocked,

10
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,990
that's when the gong rings on the fight.

11
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,680
It wasn't that fun.

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,340
Trouncing a boring guy
was naturally boring, too.

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,980
Nice fight, boy!

14
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,550
What kind of woman is your type?

15
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,480
Who are you?

16
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,570
My boredom was about
to be flipped upside-down.

17
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,560
That was the feeling she gave me.

18
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,810
JUJUTSU KAISEN

19
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,850
It's time to unleash my technique!

20
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,370
Huh? Didn't you use it before?

21
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,610
However! I have no time
to explain my technique!

22
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,700
So there's only one thing I can say to you.

23
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,430
Don't stop!

24
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,490
Believe in me!

25
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,690
Okay! That's two, though!

26
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,770
Let's analyze our opponent's cards.

27
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,230
One is roots that emerge from the ground.

28
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:19,130
That one probably gains power and speed
the more it limits quantity and range.

29
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,030
Then there's Wooden Ball.

30
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,050
Each ball can attack once or twice,
and then it's expended.

31
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:29,040
They can remain airborne,
and I have to watch for delayed activation.

32
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,520
Then there's Cursed Bud.

33
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,520
That's probably what Fushiguro got hit with.

34
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,440
Guess you're out if even if one of those hits.

35
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,300
Though I want to believe that
means it can't fire too many.

36
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,940
Then there's Flower Field.

37
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,130
It looks like that relaxes you,

38
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,490
but its earlier wounds are throwing it off.

39
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,280
No need to be too wary of it.

40
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,780
Then there's that unleashed left arm...

41
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,290
And the possibility that
all of those are bluffs!

42
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,110
However, it doesn't matter what a
technique is if you don't let them activate it!

43
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:06,550
Even accounting for unexpected situations,

44
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,550
*Self-Proclaimed IQ 530,000

45
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,040
my IQ 530,000 mental CPU
produces only one conclusion:

46
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,960
Victory!

47
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,400
Because I'm not alone,

48
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,030
Brother!

49
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,950
Because you're here!

50
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,380
Toudou!

51
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,950
Toudou!

52
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,350
That's one down.

53
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,820
Oh, Toudou!

54
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,480
I see.

55
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,000
It's simple...

56
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,240
and therefore a troublesome technique.

57
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,160
Yeah.

58
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,200
My technique swaps my position
with my opponent's.

59
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,750
Boogie Woogie!

60
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:19,460
Toudou!

61
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,070
Shh! We'll end this before
it can get used to it.

62
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,420
By the way,

63
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,940
clapping my hands

64
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,600
is necessary to activate it!

65
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,070
Their builds are too different!

66
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,240
There's a big difference after they swap!

67
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,760
Is he swapping with me?

68
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,440
Or is he swapping with Sukuna's vessel?

69
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,880
Every time he claps, that split
decision makes my thoughts falter!

70
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,470
Oh, no! I can't...

71
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,240
...break out of this!

72
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,290
They're using that again!

73
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,770
Using Black Flash consecutively
isn't anything amazing.

74
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:54,030
\hNanami Kento, record holder for consecutive Black Flash uses, speaks\h

75
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:54,530
Though it is difficult to produce more than
twice in a row, or on a different day.

76
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:58,710
It doesn't matter if you land
the first by fluke or skill.

77
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,350
Once they land a Black Flash,

78
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:05,170
sorcerers temporarily enter
a state athletes call "the zone."

79
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,050
The manipulation of cursed energy
that they normally control consciously

80
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,320
becomes as natural as breathing.

81
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:16,560
There's a sense of omnipotence,
like everything else revolves around them...

82
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,060
That might be a good way to put it.

83
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,540
My record?

84
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:26,960
Four times.

85
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,670
I just got lucky.

86
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,740
Black Flash!

87
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,540
Brother,

88
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,210
I always get that premonition from you!

89
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,860
Black Flash!

90
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,600
Black Flash!

91
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,100
Three in a row!

92
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,230
Don't get cocky!

93
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,040
Swapping positions?!

94
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,790
What I have to be wary of right now

95
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,000
is Sukuna's...

96
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,490
They didn't swap?!

97
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,260
Clapping my hands

98
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,080
doesn't necessarily mean
I'm activating my technique!

99
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,500
It's simple, but easy to fall for!

100
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:32,180
I'm getting that same premonition of
my boredom being turned upside-down!

101
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,560
Black Flash!

102
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,980
JUJUTSU KAISEN

103
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,960
JUJUTSU KAISEN

104
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,600
It's attacking before each swap!

105
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,910
It's getting used to Toudou's technique!

106
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,230
But that Black Flash rush hurt it.

107
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,850
We can exorcise it!

108
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,180
Together!

109
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:49,220
This is the first time
I've ever been hurt so badly,

110
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,880
and despite that...

111
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,700
my delight in this battle isn't waning!

112
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,220
His technique reveal was full of lies!

113
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,600
He's able to swap two others, as well?!

114
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,980
Toudou!

115
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,840
He's protecting me!

116
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,560
Don't worry, Brother!

117
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,110
By seriously hardening my
body and cursed energy,

118
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:39,070
I'll easily repel these buds!

119
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,970
Are you sure?

120
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,330
T-Takada-chan?!

121
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,790
You remember Fushiguro-kun's injuries?

122
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,590
Of course I remember!

123
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:02,810
Those are the cursed buds about
to slam into me right now!

124
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:03,930
That's why I'm—

125
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,450
But remember,

126
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:09,170
Fushiguro-kun's buds had grown a little.

127
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,320
You think they grew by absorbing his blood?

128
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,300
That's not impossible.

129
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,950
But you're facing a cursed spirit.

130
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,150
What's most likely?

131
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,400
Cursed energy!

132
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,900
Happened in 0.01 seconds

133
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,150
He dispelled his cursed
energy right before impact?

134
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,450
He figured it out?!

135
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,770
The harder they defend with cursed energy,

136
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,170
the stronger those buds become!

137
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,350
Her next one's the national?

138
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,350
*National Handshake Event

139
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,860
I'll have to thank her then,

140
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,520
won't I?

141
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,980
Hey, special-grade cursed spirit,

142
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,320
I know you've realized
I didn't tell you everything then.

143
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,210
But there's one more thing
you should be thinking about:

144
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,620
what counts as a target for Boogie Woogie!

145
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,150
With what can I swap within
the range of my technique?

146
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,870
Only creatures?

147
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,170
Non!

148
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:34,380
My technique works on cursed corpses
and inanimate objects, too.

149
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,400
So the answer is...

150
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,960
Anything possessing cursed
energy above a certain level!

151
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,940
Hey, special-grade cursed spirit,
have you noticed?

152
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:50,490
We're back at that spot again.

153
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,400
This is where it lies waiting.

154
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,550
Maki-san's special-grade
cursed tool is in the riverbed.

155
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,040
The trees on its are face
are especially fragile.

156
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,640
The river?!

157
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,140
What did I swap places with?

158
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,970
Special-grade cursed tool,

159
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,280
Playful Cloud!

160
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,900
Even a blow from a special-grade cursed
tool imbued with my cursed energy

161
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,920
didn't completely take it down?

162
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,300
Plants don't generate cursed energy.

163
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:03,700
So my left arm steals the life from plants
and converts it to cursed energy.

164
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,490
But that never gets returned to me.

165
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,600
It all goes to this flower offering.

166
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,660
I didn't want to use this if I didn't have to.

167
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,190
Toudou!

168
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,480
Stay away, Brother!

169
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,830
Its cursed energy output is incredible!

170
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:33,070
But it will be easy for you
to avoid with your technique.

171
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,470
So what shall I do?

172
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,030
Domain Ex—

173
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,100
The veil!

174
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,570
I see.

175
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:15,100
I thought he sounded
pretty good without the amp,

176
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:18,390
but this old man is the amp himself.

177
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,760
His technique amplifies the tune he plays

178
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,630
and launches it as cursed energy.

179
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,690
He's a predictable mid-range fighter.

180
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,570
It's obvious he doesn't
want me getting close.

181
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,300
Let's make a wallet

182
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,990
full of that old man smell!

183
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,210
Roger that.

184
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,720
Nishimiya, you keep going, too,
and head to Shouko.

185
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,330
It's okay.

186
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,010
Mei-san has eyes on Miwa.

187
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,490
Thank God it didn't cut off my reception.

188
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,270
Guess that's only natural,
given the effect of the veil.

189
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:05,400
There's someone working with either
a curse user or curses at Jujutsu Tech.

190
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,890
Looks like he wasn't mistaken.

191
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:11,740
Huh?

192
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,060
I thought I cut you for sure.

193
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,260
A human?

194
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,020
A curse user?!

195
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,180
This is my problem...

196
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,730
This is nice, isn't it?

197
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,350
Juuzou made it for me.

198
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,220
Didn't you run into him earlier?

199
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,730
You're weak, so have the
sword hold your hand, too.

200
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:44,970
...he said.

201
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,580
Hey, what will you give me, lady?

202
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,990
Girls hate you, don't they?

203
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:58,480
You meet someone new,
and all you talk about is yourself.

204
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,540
I'll charge you for this.

205
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,390
What makes you think you're a good
enough listener to charge for it?

206
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,300
Shut up! Stop picking fights
in moments like these!

207
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,720
You guys!

208
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:13,500
Wow! So many girls!

209
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,880
I'm so popular!

210
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,430
Were you listening to me?

211
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,140
I'll cover you.

212
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,600
Be careful not to get hit in the crossfire.

213
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,840
You be careful not to hit me!

214
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,600
The veil lifted?!

215
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,730
For real?

216
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,130
It hasn't even been 30 minutes, has it?

217
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,770
Time to run!

218
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:44,330
What was his deal?

219
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,030
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

220
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,590
I can see that slick coat rack now!

221
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,830
So...

222
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,830
Where should I start?

223
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,390
Huh?

224
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,360
Looks like this is as far as we go.

225
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,350
Huh? Gojou-sensei?!

226
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:30,630
Yuuji's on a much higher level than before.

227
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,960
I see! Aoi!

228
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,960
Of course he'd be a great match for Yuuji.

229
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,880
Looks like they're
fighting the special-grade,

230
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,640
but I shouldn't have to
worry about them now.

231
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,950
Which means my priority should be...

232
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,020
You.

233
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,740
Rack! Rack! Rack!

234
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,550
Don't kill him!

235
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,540
We have a lot to ask this guy.

236
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,470
Don't let him die on us.

237
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,030
Go on, treat him.

238
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,610
The guy near Utahime disappeared.

239
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,040
Guess he found a means to escape.

240
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,930
That just leaves that one?

241
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,210
One adept at running, too.

242
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,780
It's some distance from Yuuji.

243
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,700
Oh, well.

244
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,870
Guess I'll be a little rough.

245
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,890
Cursed Technique Amplification: Blue.

246
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,810
Cursed Technique Reversal: Red.

247
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,220
I'm withdrawing.

248
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,710
I'm not arrogant enough
to face Gojou Satoru.

249
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:52,990
Screw you!

250
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,530
What were you all trying to do here?!

251
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,090
Wait, Brother!

252
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,030
Why are you stopping me, Toudou?!

253
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,960
Don't take another step forward...

254
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,210
or you'll get caught in it.

255
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,220
Hollow...

256
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,630
Purple!

257
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,170
He's just as nonstandard as ever.

258
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,410
Now we can't tell if it was exorcised or not.

259
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,880
Ow! It hurts!

260
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,860
Quiet!

261
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,950
Yay!

262
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,720
That settles everything!

263
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,910
Or I guess it doesn't.

264
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,930
I wonder if Hanami's safe.

265
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,550
That's mission complete.

266
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:57,430
Juju Stroll

267
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:57,430
Salmon.

268
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,060
Q: Dog or cat?

269
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:06,900
Q: Are you a dog person or a cat person?

270
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,600
Dog?

271
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,710
No, maybe cat?

272
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,900
Wait, maybe dog if it's a big dog!

273
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,650
Q: Are you a dog person or a cat person?

274
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,640
Dog.

275
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,570
Dog, I think?

276
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:12,700
Q: Are you a dog person or a cat person?

277
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,700
What? I definitely prefer cats.

278
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,240
Q: Are you a dog person or a cat person?

279
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,240
Salmon.

280
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,040
Q: Are you a dog person or a cat person?

281
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,480
The answer's obviously pandas!

282
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,040
You want me to kill you?! Huh?!

283
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,850
Everyone hates me,

284
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:26,000
don't they?

285
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,220
Well, there were only two choices.

286
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,920
Just leave him be.

287
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:39,930
Episode 21:
Jujutsu Koshien
