1
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,020
Itadori-kun, why is his nose bleeding?

2
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,760
Huh? I punched him.

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,760
When?

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,210
At the start of our fight.

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,000
Did his hand touch you?

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:20,900
Yeah.

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,210
My attacks won't work on him.

8
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:25,690
Huh?!

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,740
What?! Why?!

10
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,630
I'll explain while I'm lecturing you.

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,640
One, his technique doesn't
work on Itadori-kun,

12
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,170
or two, there's some reason
he won't kill Itadori-kun.

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,110
Either way, that's good for us.

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,630
However, I can halt his movements.

15
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,480
Once we've both created an opening,
we'll shower him with blows.

16
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,990
We'll make sure to exorcise him here.

17
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,060
Yeah!

18
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,460
I'll keep an eye on Itadori Yuuji...

19
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,400
while I start by taking
care of the 7:3 sorcerer.

20
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,160
I thought this would be a good one.

21
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,830
But they just dodged it.

22
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:39,170
And after dodging it, they started
shaving away the weaker ends.

23
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,810
It's only good for small fry.

24
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,330
Time to stop.

25
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,130
Right before he changes shape...

26
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,010
...he stores up cursed energy.

27
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:57,550
Good.

28
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,380
Even though I've made myself smaller,

29
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,750
there's still the risk of Itadori
Yuuji killing me in one blow.

30
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,390
He really is my natural enemy.

31
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,510
I'll need to make him behave for a bit.

32
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,000
Transfigured humans!

33
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,350
He still had a stockpile of them?

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,970
Kill the short-haired brat.

35
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,920
I knew it.

36
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,660
He can't kill humans!

37
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,440
Let's play!

38
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,070
Please...

39
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,170
kill me...

40
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,660
Next, I'll have him attack you, too.

41
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,480
I wonder if he'll cry then.

42
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,420
He's a foolish brat who can't
reconcile reality and his ideals.

43
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,170
You're wrong.

44
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,170
He's right in the middle of
making that reconciliation.

45
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,950
If it were up to me,

46
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,680
I'd say you're the fool.

47
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,930
Did you kill them?!

48
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,830
They know my tricks now.

49
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,780
I'm changing shape right
before the moment of impact.

50
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,770
I don't have time to create a substitute.

51
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,360
Ah, what...

52
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,880
what fresh inspiration this is!

53
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,110
Is this...

54
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,840
Death

55
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,190
death?

56
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,800
I bet I could do it now.

57
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,610
Domain Expansion:

58
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,530
Self-Embodiment of Perfection!

59
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,260
Shit.

60
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,190
Right now, I'm just...

61
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,750
grateful to you.

62
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:07,030
JUJUTSU KAISEN

63
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:26,690
Episode 13:  Tomorrow

64
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,690
Quit screwing around!

65
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,870
Why did he only seal Nanamin inside?!

66
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,940
At this rate...

67
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,620
At this rate...

68
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,320
Domain Expansion.

69
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,500
Within an innate domain
constructed from cursed energy,

70
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,420
their ultimate technique
becomes one guaranteed to hit.

71
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,080
It's the height of jujutsu
sorcery I could never obtain.

72
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,290
Most likely, his cursed technique
requires touching the target

73
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:00,830
with his palm in its base state in
order to interfere with their soul.

74
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,180
However, in a domain that guarantees a hit,

75
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,400
that would mean I'm...

76
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,170
literally in the palm of his hand now.

77
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,650
Shit.

78
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,930
Jujutsu sorcerers are shit.

79
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,210
They have to be prepared to
cast away their lives for others,

80
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,160
and to occasionally force
their comrades to do so.

81
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,870
That's why I quit.

82
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,610
Or more like I ran away.

83
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,690
Do you like casse-croute?

84
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,580
Huh?

85
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,040
Huh?

86
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,350
You always buy this one, don't you?

87
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,040
Oh, uh, yes.

88
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,380
They stopped selling it at
my local convenience store.

89
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,820
It's much better than a
convenience store's, isn't it?

90
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,310
Well, you are a bakery.

91
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,360
Wow, harsh.

92
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,700
Please come back again.

93
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,070
Fly head...

94
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,930
Leaving it alone won't hurt anything.

95
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,740
It'd be a bigger pain to deal with it and
have her think I'm some weird medium.

96
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,320
Hello, everybody!

97
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,360
You making those sales?!

98
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,720
When people trust us with their money,
they're trusting us with their lives.

99
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,260
So it goes without saying that we have to
balance the pursuit of profit against the risks.

100
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:23,050
There's no need to do
anything special at the start.

101
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,780
Just be sincere with the clients.

102
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,660
Never forget that.

103
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:28,620
Right!

104
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,010
Nanami...

105
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,590
Don't be so prudish all the time.

106
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,150
You're scaring the virgin.

107
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:39,730
So, new boy, what you need to think about,
first and foremost, are the company's profits.

108
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,170
They're directly connected
to our clients' profits, too!

109
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,130
Even when we con the client into buying
shitty stocks with no growth potential?

110
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,400
Of course!

111
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:52,180
It's suitable payment for us staring
at the markets around the clock.

112
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,150
Nanami, this is your second year, right?

113
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,730
You're clever. Let yourself run a bit more wild.

114
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,440
I have high expectations for you.

115
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,740
I'm someone with no concept of a "reason
for living" or "something worth doing."

116
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,650
I'll just earn a reasonable amount
of money by the time I'm 30 or 40,

117
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,780
and enjoy the rest of my aimless life
in a country with a low cost of living.

118
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,600
It's been four years since I left the school.

119
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,030
Whether I'm awake or asleep,
all I think about is money.

120
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:23,630
Curses and other people have nothing
to do with me as long I have money.

121
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,260
Money.

122
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,270
Money.

123
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,780
Money.

124
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,920
Money, money...

125
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,980
As long as I have money...

126
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,860
Are you all right?

127
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,980
Are you getting enough sleep?

128
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,110
What about you?

129
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,810
You look like your
fatigue's been building up.

130
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,280
Oh, you can tell?

131
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,730
Lately, it feels like there's
a weight on my shoulder.

132
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,940
I haven't been sleeping well, either.

133
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:58,450
My job is to take money from the wealthy

134
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,550
and make those people even more wealthy.

135
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,180
That's pretty much all it is.

136
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,980
Frankly, no one would mind if I was gone.

137
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,570
People who wanted to eat bread
would mind if their bakery was gone.

138
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:19,040
Yet for some reason, my job, which exists
outside that natural human cycle, pays better.

139
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,900
When you think about it
logically, it makes no sense.

140
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,080
A-Are you bragging?

141
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,960
No, I'm not.

142
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,490
Sorry, that was a bit complicated for me.

143
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,160
Could you take a step forward, please?

144
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,140
Huh?

145
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,680
How's your shoulder now?

146
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,530
Huh? Well...

147
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,810
Huh?! It's lighter!

148
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,580
If anything still feels off,
please go to the hospital.

149
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,620
Please excuse me.

150
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,960
Hey, wait!

151
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,720
Hold on!

152
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,830
Um...

153
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,830
Thank you!

154
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,850
Please come back again!

155
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,220
"Thank you."

156
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,550
Huh? Didn't you hear me? Thank you!

157
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,120
Please! Come back! Again!

158
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,730
Gojou Satoru

159
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,660
I always thought I was a person with
no concept of a "reason for living."

160
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,850
Hello, it's Nanami. I need to talk to you.

161
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,040
Yes, I'll be stopping by Jujutsu Tech tomorrow...

162
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,240
Why are you laughing?

163
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,960
Idle Transfiguration.

164
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,420
I'm grateful to you.

165
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,560
I don't need your gratitude.

166
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,590
I've already received it from lots of others.

167
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,040
I have no regrets.

168
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,520
How was he able to get in?

169
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:14,680
That's right... The more resistant
the inside of the barrier is,

170
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,140
the weaker it is to attacks from outside.

171
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:20,730
Domains are barriers specialized
in trapping something inside,

172
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,550
so they're actually easy to invade...

173
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,030
because there's no merit in doing so.

174
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,190
With Domains like Infinite Void and
Self-Embodiment of Perfection,

175
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:38,210
which guarantee victory, once they've ensnared
their target, that's even more true.

176
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,190
However,

177
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,690
inside Itadori-kun,

178
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,890
there lies something that must not be touched.

179
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,770
I warned you...

180
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,640
that there wouldn't be a second time.

181
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,030
There is no one in this world
more proud and conceited.

182
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,650
He lives guided by only his
pleasure and displeasure.

183
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,140
Whether you die...

184
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,670
or you die...

185
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,610
doesn't matter.

186
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,730
Aside from him,

187
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,810
I truly don't care.

188
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,010
JUJUTSU KAISEN

189
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,020
JUJUTSU KAISEN

190
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,150
What just happened?

191
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,780
I'll kill you!

192
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,330
Domain Expansion...

193
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,120
That really burns cursed energy.

194
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,890
It truly is a trump card. A final technique.

195
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,380
And that damn Sukuna just...

196
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,040
But this is the critical moment!

197
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,850
Squeeze it out!

198
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,960
The last of my cursed energy!

199
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:32,890
The target's huge.

200
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,110
The flow of cursed energy is calm.

201
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,550
There are no counters.

202
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,250
I can land my attack for certain.

203
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,750
This is my last chance.

204
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,490
I don't need any more tactics.

205
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,780
Divergent Fist!

206
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,240
Wh-What is this lack of feedback?

207
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,430
Bye-bye!

208
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,390
Hold up!

209
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,430
This was fun.

210
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,280
Ino-kun, the core has
escaped into the sewers.

211
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:26,980
Yes.

212
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,390
Please scour everything from my
current location to the southeast.

213
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,740
Even you could exorcise him right now.

214
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,880
Let's pursue him, too!

215
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,130
Itadori-kun!

216
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,940
Come on, body! Move!

217
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,390
You're going to kill that thing, aren't you?!

218
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:48,750
You're going to crush him... into a pulp...

219
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,520
Itadori-kun!

220
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,410
Itadori-kun!

221
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,560
So that was the King of Curses,
Ryoumen Sukuna.

222
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:21,810
He should have less total cursed energy
than Jougo at this point in time, and yet...

223
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,290
That presence...

224
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,060
His soul's on a different level.

225
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,450
I'm certain of it.

226
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,890
Even if we're all wiped out,

227
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:34,470
so long as Sukuna is resurrected,
the age of curses will come.

228
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,470
Still, damn, this sucks.

229
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,870
Right now, I want nothing
more than to kill Itadori Yuuji!

230
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,490
It's so frustrating!

231
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,870
But whatever.

232
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,390
Unlike his body,

233
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,990
I can kill his soul over and over again.

234
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,090
How should I kill it next time?

235
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,540
You were told to rest, weren't you?

236
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,810
Is this my lecture?

237
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:16,000
I have no lecture to give to
the person who saved my life.

238
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:17,780
I saved you?

239
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,930
That patchwork's cursed technique
was interfering with the soul.

240
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:27,520
Since you invaded his domain,
he wound up touching Sukuna's soul.

241
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,840
I was saved because of that.

242
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:34,320
But I didn't swap with him.

243
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,590
Sukuna never came out. Our opponent went in.

244
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,600
Then it wasn't me who saved you.

245
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,170
It was just his whim.

246
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:49,600
Nanamin, I killed a person today.

247
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,370
People die. There's no stopping that.

248
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,630
So I wanted them to at
least have proper deaths.

249
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:57,760
That's what I thought.

250
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,760
So I was always thinking about how I could
keep that trigger from being pulled.

251
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,290
But...

252
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:06,600
after pulling that trigger myself,
I don't understand anymore.

253
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,220
What is a proper death?

254
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,810
I don't know what that is, either.

255
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,930
Even if good people dying in peace

256
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:17,540
and evil people being punished
with death is the proper way,

257
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:21,260
most of the people in this world
are neither good nor evil.

258
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:25,320
Death is the final destination for all of us,
but no one dies the same death.

259
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,070
Trying to guide all of them to their
proper end would surely be arduous.

260
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,990
I personally wouldn't recommend it.

261
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,120
But you'll still do it anyway, won't you?

262
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,400
Just don't end up dying
yourself in the process.

263
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,060
Just as I would've died today
if you hadn't been there,

264
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,790
you'll see there are plenty of people
yet to come that need you, too.

265
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:51,120
Because you're a jujutsu
sorcerer now, Itadori-kun.

266
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,710
Put it in this box once you've filled it out.

267
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,580
And you don't need to write your name.

268
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,280

269
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:27,690
You're the one who gave Yoshino
those scars, aren't you, Itou?

270
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:34,400
I don't want hear any bitching from the guy
who was too scared to do anything at the time.

271
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,910
He quit school and moved away, didn't he?

272
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,150
So who cares?

273
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,430
What about me?

274
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,680
I've barely been able to move
my left arm since that day.

275
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,460
We're talking about your crimes right now.

276
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,670
Reflect on the punishment
you earned by yourself.

277
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,420
And where's your punishment?

278
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,230
Mine is yet to come.

279
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,620
First, I need to take a proper
look at the things I couldn't see.

280
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,190
Both you...

281
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,420
and I...

282
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,000
will have to bear the crime of killing
Yoshino's heart for the rest of our lives.

283
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:09,050
I'll be watching you, Itou.

284
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:17,850
I don't understand what a proper death is.

285
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,530
So at least...

286
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,370
until I do understand,

287
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,090
until I kill him,

288
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,260
I won't...

289
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,210
lose again.

290
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,520
Juju Stroll

291
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,520
Tuna.

292
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,890
Is it ready yet?

293
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,030
Salmon, salmon.

294
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,820
These meatballs are great.

295
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,930
Who made them?

296
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,260
Oh, I did.

297
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,910
They're easy to make.

298
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:40,790
1) Put all the ingredients in. Use twice as much ginger.

299
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:44,300
2) Mix together well and knead it.

300
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:49,510
3) Shape with spoons and toss into the pot.

301
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:54,060
Ingredients

302
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:54,060
Ground chicken

303
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:54,060
Finely chopped green onions

304
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:54,060
Ginger paste

305
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:54,060
Egg yolks (you can use the whites, too, if it's too much hassle)

306
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:54,060
Salt and pepper

307
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,570
Bonito flakes.

308
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:00,520
You can cook for yourself?
Not really surprising, actually.

309
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,060
No, Itadori taught me how to make these.

310
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,650
I see.

311
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,820
Itadori's legacy.

312
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,230
I don't think that's right.

313
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,770
These meatballs are great.

314
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:29,470
Oh, those are super easy to make.

315
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,360
Even Fushiguro can make them.

316
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,480
I taught him how.

317
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,360
I can't wait to see those two again.

318
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:54,990
Episode 14:
Kyoto Sister School Exchange Event - Group Battle 0 -
