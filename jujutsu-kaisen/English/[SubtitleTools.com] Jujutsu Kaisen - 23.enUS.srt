1
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,310
Got you!

2
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,110
What was that blood he spat out?

3
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,110
Poison?

4
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,000
What's this?

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,570
You're strong.

6
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,470
That's no fun.

7
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,530
Straw Doll Technique:

8
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,080
Resonance!

9
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,760
How many of them are there?

10
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,400
We should just keep going
like it's whack-a-mole, huh?

11
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,270
Yeah.

12
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:32,690
Keep going.

13
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,850
Keep exorcising them for me.

14
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,780
We'll crush every last one of them.

15
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,000
It likely won't retaliate.

16
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,890
You mean its main body
doesn't have much offense

17
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,680
since its technique covers a
wide area, even limited as it is?

18
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,980
I'm only saying it's likely.

19
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,550
All the things we were worried about—
its technique's range,

20
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,530
the number of victims, the barrier—

21
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,870
All of those are subtracting
from its main body.

22
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,500
We're lucky.

23
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,890
We'll be able to exorcise it quickly, then.

24
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,680
Which means... the real
problem comes afterward.

25
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,400
Kugisaki!

26
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,360
I'll be fine.

27
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,610
You just whack the mole.

28
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,220
Damn it!

29
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,780
She gets sucked away so often!

30
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,960
But what was that just now?

31
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,130
The mole?

32
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,440
That earlier one?

33
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,060
It's neither!

34
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,310
Kugisaki?

35
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,470
Oh, hey, it's my older brother!

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,900
Me, too!

37
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,770
It fled?!

38
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,350
Should I let it go?

39
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,770
Chase after it!

40
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:58,780
Kugisaki and that thing both
went outside the barrier!

41
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,790
She might be battling against something
more troublesome than we expected!

42
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,250
In contrast, things are far
easier here than anticipated!

43
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,770
I can handle this by myself!

44
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,290
Prioritize Kugisaki! Go after it!

45
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,690
If things get bad in here,

46
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,640
then you come out, too.

47
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,390
Why, you...

48
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,680
Don't touch me!

49
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,320
You're a woman?

50
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,650
Well, pardon me.

51
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,440
We brothers were tasked with an errand.

52
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:49,200
But killing jujutsu sorcerers
isn't part of that.

53
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,660
If you withdraw, we'll let you escape,

54
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,670
young lady.

55
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,170
An errand?

56
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,160
Hm? I presumed you were
on the same errand.

57
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,570
A cursed spirit? A curse user?

58
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,170
Which is he?

59
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,170
And what is that smell?

60
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,490
Last one!

61
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,490
Your sneak attack's too simple.

62
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,230
I told you, it's too simple.

63
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,670
Did I exorcise them all?

64
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,700
That takes care of Tsumiki for now.

65
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,220
Now to...

66
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,010
One survived?

67
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,670
That wasn't its main body just now?

68
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,010
The barrier hasn't collapsed, either.

69
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,010
What?

70
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,860
I shouldn't try too hard to find logic
in a cursed spirit's behavioral patterns,

71
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,660
but that fact had been
nagging me this whole time.

72
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:27,020
Why did it just start killing
humans it had marked now?

73
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,760
The first one was killed in June.

74
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,560
And in June...

75
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,010
Our objective here...

76
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,490
is to retrieve Sukuna's finger.

77
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,810
JUJUTSU KAISEN

78
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:26,370
Episode 23: The Origin of Blind Obedience - 2 -

79
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,480
Some have a presence
that's too overwhelming.

80
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,030
Some keep very quiet.

81
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,330
Some have already been
absorbed by a cursed spirit.

82
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,290
This is resonance.

83
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,440
Sukuna's finger kept its power repressed

84
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,210
within the cursed spirit
that had absorbed it,

85
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:37,780
but back in June,

86
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,720
when Sukuna manifested in Itadori,
it released its cursed energy.

87
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,110
It looks the same

88
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,820
as the one from the juvenile detention center,
but it's probably several degrees...

89
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,400
stronger!

90
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,630
Nue!

91
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:17,200
Okay, I win again.

92
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,410
This is unusual.

93
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,850
You rarely ask me to train you, Megumi.

94
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,650
Are you in a rush after Yuji surpassed you?

95
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,760
Well, beggars can't be choosers.

96
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:33,280
It bothers you that much to rely on me?

97
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,730
Megumi, listen.

98
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:40,290
I think you have just as much ability
and potential as Yuji does.

99
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,670
The problem is just your mindset.

100
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,290
Megumi,

101
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,090
you don't know how to
bring out your best, do you?

102
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,290
Huh?

103
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,410
Are you saying I haven't
been giving it my best?

104
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,380
I'm not saying you haven't.
I'm saying you can't.

105
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,100
For example, in the baseball game the other day...

106
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,760
Why did you go for a sacrifice bunt?

107
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,940
Did you want Nobara to advance the bases,

108
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,930
even if it meant you'd be out?

109
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,810
That's a splendid attitude,

110
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:16,060
but Yuji and I would
always go for a home run.

111
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,610
I'm not saying a bunt is bad.

112
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,620
Baseball is a team sport,

113
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,910
and everyone has their role to play.

114
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,660
But jujutsu sorcery is an individual sport.

115
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,710
Coordinating with other sorcerers
is important, isn't it?

116
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,630
Sure.

117
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,030
But no matter how many
allies you have around you,

118
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,050
when you die, you'll be alone.

119
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:45,270
You can only piece together
undervalued data on yourself and others.

120
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,430
You can't imagine a stronger
future version of yourself.

121
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,880
Maybe that's because of your trump card?

122
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,430
You believe that in the worst case,

123
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,590
you can resolve everything
at the cost of your life.

124
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,120
But at that point, forget about me.

125
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,750
You'll never even measure up to Nanami.

126
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:07,060
Dying to win and risking death to win...

127
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:14,060
are completely different, Megumi.

128
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,870
Give it your best.

129
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,000
Be greedier.

130
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,880
How many seconds was I unconscious?

131
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,790
My Demon Dog's destroyed...

132
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,480
no, the technique was released.

133
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,960
This is it for me.

134
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:50,080
Sacred treasure, swing...

135
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,170
What a waste of talent.

136
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,400
Screw it!

137
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,160
A jujutsu sorcerer's growth curve

138
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,300
isn't necessarily a gentle slope.

139
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:15,260
Back then, why did you run?

140
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,370
Spit out the entire depths of my shadow...

141
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,050
Worry about a specific structure later,

142
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,380
and just push it out as soon
as I collect the cursed energy.

143
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:33,250
Imagine a future version of myself
who's freely surpassed my limits!

144
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,450
I'll do it!

145
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,410
With a strong foundation,

146
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,330
and a little bit of sense and imagination,

147
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:44,260
it just takes the slightest trigger
to change a person.

148
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,800
Domain Expansion:

149
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,350
Chimera Shadow Garden!

150
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,720
It's incomplete!

151
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,210
It's ugly work at best.

152
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,030
But for now, that's fine!

153
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,720
Broaden it...

154
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,760
more freely!

155
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,010
The interpretation

156
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,560
of the technique!

157
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:04,960
Demon Dog Totality's claws
were able to injure that thing.

158
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,430
They'd have no trouble piercing through
you when you're caught off-guard.

159
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,980
I'm tired.

160
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,600
Now, where are those guys?

161
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,870
Good!

162
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,760
That's good!

163
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,930
JUJUTSU KAISEN

164
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,940
JUJUTSU KAISEN

165
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,680
There's one fundamental rule
for interacting with others.

166
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,140
Do you know what that is?

167
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,820
I don't.

168
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:15,420
It's "I won't kill you,

169
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,780
so please don't kill me, either."

170
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,340
You can substitute "kill"
for anything you please.

171
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:25,510
The point is drawing a line where you agree
not to infringe on the other person.

172
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,040
In order for both people to exist together,

173
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,400
they need that rule.

174
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,830
Breaking that rule, swaggering about,

175
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,970
and having others trying not to anger you

176
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,220
must have felt real pleasant.

177
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,940
Next time you do it in
front of me, I'll kill you.

178
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,100
What did we ever do to you?

179
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,220
Figure it out yourself,

180
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,610
or go die.

181
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:49,600
Hey!

182
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,120
T-T-T-T-Today's the day I tell
off Ikezawa and his buddies!

183
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,240
I'm not their gofer anymore!

184
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,940
You can do it, Aida-shi!

185
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,000
But I might become their next target,

186
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,120
so don't try too hard, Aida-shi!

187
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,080
Hey, come on, fatty!

188
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,510
I'm changing the line!

189
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,840
I'll tell them this fatty is my
replacement starting today!

190
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,750
You'd sell your friend out, Aida-shi?!

191
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,080
Shut up!

192
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,990
Megumi.

193
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,280
Huh?

194
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,010
Isn't that Ikezawa and his
buddies piled up over there?

195
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,090
You said you wouldn't fight anymore.

196
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,020
Don't act like you're my guardian.

197
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,520
I hate bad people.

198
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,780
They act so damn superior when
their empathy and imagination

199
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,140
are as empty as a vacant lot.

200
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,760
I can't deal with good people.

201
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,970
They forgive those bad people.

202
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,020
Then they view the act of
forgiveness as a noble thing.

203
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,810
Makes me want to vomit.

204
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,360
Tsumiki's a model example of a good person.

205
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,510
You disgust me.

206
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,460
Oh, sorry.

207
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,190
I didn't think it'd spill out.

208
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,270
When I was in first grade,

209
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,040
my father and Tsumiki's mother,

210
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,490
one parent each, hooked up...

211
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,190
and then vanished without a trace.

212
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,630
A suspicious white-haired man told us...

213
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,460
You know, your dad...

214
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:31,120
He's from the Zen'in Clan,
a big clan among jujutsu sorcerers,

215
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,980
but they're such good-for-nothings,
it freaks even me out.

216
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,580
Your father left the clan to have you.

217
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,140
Megumi-kun,

218
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:44,550
your father was saving you as the ultimate
card to use against the Zen'in clan.

219
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,740
Pisses you off, doesn't it?

220
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,650
That solved the mystery of how
they got the funds to disappear.

221
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,650
Apparently, I had been sold
to that Zen'in clan.

222
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,330
Yeah, it pisses me off.

223
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,860
Especially your lack of tact about it.

224
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:04,160
Plus, that irritating man stopped
my sale to the Zen'in clan,

225
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:08,420
and used the promise that I would work
as a jujutsu sorcerer as collateral

226
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:12,710
to get financial aid from
Jujutsu High to support us both.

227
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,120
What's this jujutsu sorcerer crap, anyway?

228
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,280
It's bullshit.

229
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,410
Who the hell would I ever save?

230
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,680
Hey, Tsumiki!

231
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,480
What are you doing?

232
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,110
Megumi-kun, ciao!

233
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,640
Nothing.

234
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,770
Hey, hold on.

235
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:32,150
So did you give any thought
to the test of courage?

236
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,040
I don't want to go, but I'll go
because I'm worried about you.

237
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,870
Shortly after I started ninth grade,

238
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,960
Tsumiki was cursed.

239
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,980
The identity was unknown.
The origin was unknown.

240
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,170
But apparently there were several
victims of the same curse nationwide.

241
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,330
All I found out was that
nobody knew anything,

242
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,520
and Tsumiki was left bedridden.

243
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,080
If I have the time to curse someone,

244
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,630
I'd rather spend it thinking
about those precious to me.

245
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,530
She always smiled and spouted pretty ideals.

246
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,360
Not forgiving people isn't a bad thing.

247
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,560
That's just part of your kindness, isn't it?

248
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,900
She even accepted my disposition.

249
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:17,050
Yet Tsumiki would get genuinely
angry whenever I hurt someone, too.

250
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,970
That irritated me because

251
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,570
I thought it was hypocritical in light
of her leave-others-be policy,

252
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,900
but now I realize I had the wrong idea.

253
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,660
Just as I choose who I save,

254
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,200
she was choosing me to worry about.

255
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,290
I'm sorry.

256
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,020
I was just a kid.

257
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,920
I'll apologize.

258
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:45,360
So wake up already, stupid sister.

259
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,990
Damn, my head hurts...

260
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:54,520
This Yasohachi Bridge curse
was just overlapping the other one.

261
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,150
I doubt the curse that put Tsumiki
into a coma was undone.

262
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:05,960
Now, how do I break the news
about the finger... to... Itadori...

263
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,950
Fushiguro
Fell
Asleep

264
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,890
A huge presence suddenly appeared.

265
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,460
Did Sukuna's finger leave the barrier?

266
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:24,300
If a sorcerer exorcised the finger's host,

267
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,960
they're quite good.

268
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,400
But even if the finger's...

269
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,540
Even if the special-grade
cursed spirit was defeated,

270
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,410
they wouldn't come out unscathed.

271
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,460
I hope they're okay.

272
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,190
I misspoke.

273
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:44,560
Please forget what I just said.

274
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,050
Hold on!

275
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,160
He's going after the finger!

276
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,960
You think you can mock me
by running like that

277
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,640
and still get away from me?

278
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,470
I'm a bit insecure about my back, you see.

279
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,000
This is your warning.

280
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:03,010
If you see my back, I'll kill—

281
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,130
Oh, Kugisaki!

282
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,010
Oh, brother!

283
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:13,380
Y-Y-Y-You saw, didn't you?!

284
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,630
Huh?! Who?!

285
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,930
Sorry, brother!

286
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,920
Sorry, I guess?

287
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:15,700
It wasn't on purpose!

288
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,190
It wasn't on purpose!

289
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,680
I'll kill you!

290
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,020
Then why are you dressed like that?

291
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,860
Is that the source of this weird smell?

292
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,540
Because it gets musty!

293
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,290
Rot Technique, Supreme Art: Wing King!

294
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,050
Death...

295
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:44,590
by Wasp!

296
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:17,440
Juju Stroll

297
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,750
Sensei!

298
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,770
Kugisaki!

299
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,770
Huh?

300
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,140
So annoying.

301
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,750
It's too hot for your craziness.

302
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,030
Fushiguro's getting hit on!

303
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,100
Formation B!

304
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,330
Roger!

305
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,530
Fushiguro-kyun!

306
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,110
Who is that woman?!

307
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,660
Have you forgotten the night
you toasted to my eyes?

308
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,910
Was it all a lie when you said your time
with me was the most enjoyable of all?!

309
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,210
That night! That night!

310
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,550
What?

311
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,820
Seriously, what?

312
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,730
Could you not touch him so casually, please,

313
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:56,310
you homewreckers?!

314
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:02,260
Megumi-chan has violin practice with me now.

315
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,330
Let's go home, Megumi-chan.

316
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:08,990
Today I'll have you master
"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star."

317
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,470
It's okay.

318
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,100
Don't mind them. Just go ahead.

319
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,760
The station's straight ahead.

320
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,450
Thank you so much.

321
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,310
Huh?

322
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:19,010
Okay, seriously, what is this?

323
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,130
Could you stop? You're embarrassing me.

324
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,880
Explain!

325
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,880
Ow!

326
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:39,890
Episode 24:
The Origin of Blind Obedience - 3 -
