1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Episode 19:  Black Flash

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,590
Are you all right, Inumaki-senpai?

3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,760
Salmon.

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,630
Here it comes!

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,450
Stop.

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,460
Convergence!

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,980
Piercing Blood!

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,540
He wounded it?

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,870
So he wasn't serious at all
when he fought me, then?

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,920
Hurry! He's just gonna heal right away!

11
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,740
Inumaki will stop it,

12
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,330
we'll attack, and then
we'll get away from it.

13
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,200
Then we repeat that as we
try to get outside this veil

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,070
and rejoin the principal and the others.

15
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,920
But there's no telling when the
current balance will fall apart.

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,930
His cursed speech isn't
affecting it much anyway,

17
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,350
and we're not getting a chance
to contact the teachers.

18
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,510
If it figures out how to deal with
his cursed speech, we're finished.

19
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,360
Hurry!

20
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,530
We don't know what
the cursed spirit's after.

21
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,250
There's a chance the principal and

22
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,480
the other sorcerers stationed at
Jujutsu Tech haven't taken action.

23
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,670
I'd like to quickly rejoin Toudou,

24
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,290
or at the very least, Miwa, but...

25
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,360
Inumaki-senpai will stop it.

26
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,710
Don't worry! Just go!

27
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,430
St—

28
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,560
He's the one hitting his limit first?!

29
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,800
Are you alive, Kamo-san?

30
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:10,650
He wasn't using powerful words,
but it still destroyed his throat.

31
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,850
It's just that much stronger!

32
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,720
Mustard leaf.

33
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,690
Inumaki-senpai...

34
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,680
That's enough!

35
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,660
Blast away!

36
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,180
You can't cut me with that dull blade.

37
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,400
Its eye trees are more
fragile than the rest!

38
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,910
Now this sword isn't so bad.

39
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,030
I have something even better.

40
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,210
This one feels disgusting to use, though.

41
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,540
"Cursed tools" refers to
weapons imbued with curses.

42
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,440
Based on their force and effects,

43
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,720
they're divided into grades one
through four, just like sorcerers.

44
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,600
The higher a cursed tool's grade,

45
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,260
the greater the advantage it
provides in jujutsu combat.

46
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,240
Megumi, make absolutely
sure you don't lose that.

47
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,660
I won't lose it.

48
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,790
If you sold it, you'd get
at least five billion for it.

49
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,760
Huh?

50
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,490
Special-grade cursed tool:

51
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,140
Playful Cloud!

52
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,960
Indeed, that is a good weapon.

53
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:29,980
Demon Dog...

54
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,480
With the exception of my expanded
technique, Bottomless Well,

55
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,220
if any of my ten shikigami
are completely destroyed,

56
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,910
I can never manifest them again.

57
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,920
However, the power and techniques
of the destroyed shikigami

58
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,490
are passed on to the others.

59
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,640
...Totality!

60
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,820
It's fast.

61
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,310
It's trying to take off
my wounded arm first?

62
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,600
The sorcerer boy is in the forest...

63
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,600
The boy's sword!

64
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,040
Maki-san!

65
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,700
Please don't ever make me use
that three-section staff again!

66
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,670
It's too hard to use!

67
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,100
It's handy once you get used—

68
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,530
Megumi!

69
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,680
Maki-san!

70
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,260
Damn it! All because I screwed up!

71
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,550
My strike was aimed for your heart.

72
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,770
What a wonderful reaction.

73
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,610
Jujutsu sorcerers are
extraordinarily compassionate.

74
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,670
An opening is always created
when their ally is injured.

75
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,010
It's destroyed?!

76
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,690
No, Megumi released the technique!

77
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,660
You shouldn't use cursed techniques anymore.

78
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,540
The bud embedded in you loves cursed energy.

79
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:30,680
The more you use techniques, the deeper
its roots will extend into your body.

80
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,920
How kind of you to warn me.

81
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,180
You're planning to kill us anyway, though.

82
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,420
Apparently, it works faster
when I explain it.

83
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,220
You move well.

84
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:52,500
But you're missing the edge you had earlier.

85
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,700
Wring out that cursed energy,

86
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,410
even if it rips my stomach open!

87
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,690
I'm not like everyone else.

88
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,810
I choose who I protect.

89
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,320
I shoulder the least responsibility!

90
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,200
Therefore...

91
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:25,500
I'm not allowed to fall before anyone else!

92
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,510
Megumi, stop!

93
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,940
Our job is done.

94
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,920
It's time to tag out.

95
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,580
You good to go, my friend?

96
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:02,960
Yeah!

97
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,770
JUJUTSU KAISEN

98
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,080
So heavy...

99
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:45,060
I can't believe these two
were beaten this badly.

100
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,360
We're counting on you, Toudou-kun.

101
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:53,120
Your strength is the one thing
you've got going for you.

102
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,540
Stop, Itadori!

103
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,700
That's not something we can han—

104
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,120
Panda.

105
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,540
Yeah?

106
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,780
Take those two and exit the veil.

107
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:16,370
According to Nishimiya,
this is an anti-Gojou Satoru veil,

108
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,280
so we can come and go without issue.

109
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,470
Wait! Even you can't—

110
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,500
Fushiguro.

111
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,890
It's okay.

112
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,170
Please.

113
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,020
Looks like you've realized it.

114
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:38,770
Nobody is allowed to touch those
who have started growing wings.

115
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,180
And that's exactly where
Itadori stands right now.

116
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,680
If you die again, I'll kill you myself!

117
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,040
Okay, let's go.

118
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,410
Pandash!

119
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,170
Guess I can't afford to die now.

120
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,670
I won't lift a finger to help,

121
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,290
Itadori.

122
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,050
Not until you land a Black Flash.

123
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,740
If you can't land a Black Flash,

124
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,110
then I'll just watch you die,

125
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,810
no matter what happens to you.

126
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,310
Got it!

127
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:17,770
Sukuna's vessel and... Who is that man?

128
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,890
He has a certain presence,

129
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,320
but the amount of cursed energy he possesses

130
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,330
is most definitely less than mine.

131
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,560
However, he has that mysterious brazenness.

132
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,640
He must have quite the technique,

133
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,850
since I couldn't move carelessly before him.

134
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,590
And what is this "Black Flash"?

135
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,490
So, how will they attack?

136
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,300
You can talk?

137
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,430
There's something I want to ask you.

138
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,110
Are you allied with

139
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:57,270
a humanoid cursed spirit
who has a patchwork face?

140
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,280
And if I say I am?

141
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,060
He didn't carelessly close the distance.

142
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,210
I commend him for that.

143
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,280
He's fast!

144
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,080
He has more explosive power
than the earlier girl!

145
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,880
However, its intensity is poor.

146
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,350
Its torso's wide open!

147
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,480
It's letting its guard down because I held back.

148
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,840
I can land it now!

149
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,280
Black Flash!

150
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,600
Damn it!

151
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,220
My friend.

152
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:49,080
Anger is an important trigger for sorcerers.

153
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,680
Sometimes they can be taken down

154
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,960
purely because they accidentally
angered their foe.

155
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,820
And the opposite is also true.

156
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,770
Sometimes they lose because their
own anger disrupts their cursed energy,

157
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,940
so they can't exercise their abilities.

158
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,690
Your friend has been wounded,

159
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:11,490
and worse yet, they've rained on your
honeymoon with me, your best friend,

160
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:16,500
so I can really understand
why you'd be boiling with rage.

161
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,440
But that rage is too much for you.

162
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,010
Put it away for now.

163
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,950
Are they fighting each other?

164
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,950
Are those stray thoughts gone now?

165
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,120
Yeah, not a single one left.

166
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:41,250
Thank you so much, best friend!

167
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,000
Black Flash.

168
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,520
It's a distortion of space born
from the impact of cursed energy

169
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:54,180
delivered within a trillionth
of a second of a blow.

170
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,690
It delivers 2.5 times the
force of a normal strike.

171
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:03,240
There are no sorcerers who can
consistently use Black Flash.

172
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,690
However...

173
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,720
Between those who have experienced
Black Flash and those who have not,

174
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,700
their distance from the core of cursed energy
is like that of Heaven from Earth.

175
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,000
What tremendous concentration...

176
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,970
The instant cursed energy impacts
within a trillionth of a second of a blow,

177
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,560
space is distorted...

178
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,770
and cursed energy flashes black.

179
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,920
Black Flash!

180
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,090
Wha—

181
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,420
He's grown.

182
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,980
JUJUTSU KAISEN

183
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,960
JUJUTSU KAISEN

184
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,590
He's grown.

185
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:20,100
That was... Black Flash?

186
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,040
What?

187
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,850
This is my cursed energy, right?

188
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:30,110
Now you understand
the taste of cursed energy.

189
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,080
Up until now,

190
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:41,250
you've just been throwing an
ingredient you've never tasted before

191
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,080
into a pot and boiling it
without knowing why.

192
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,250
But after experiencing Black Flash

193
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:51,090
and understanding the taste of
your ingredient, your cursed energy,

194
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,600
you stand on a completely different level
as a chef than you did three seconds ago.

195
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,100
Congratulations, brother.

196
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,900
You can become strong.

197
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:09,820
I had heard that Sukuna's vessel
was immature as a sorcerer,

198
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,770
but he and this mysterious man...

199
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,910
Something about them is different
from the other masses.

200
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,540
It can heal?!

201
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,410
A cursed spirit's body is made
up of cursed energy.

202
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:27,210
Unlike us, they don't need any advanced
reversed cursed technique to heal.

203
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,630
An injury like that is
nothing to a special-grade.

204
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,470
But there's no doubt that it
shaves away their cursed energy,

205
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,390
and if you crush their head, it's game-set.

206
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,390
Now, shall we get cooking?

207
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,900
It would seem that

208
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,350
I should take you two somewhat seriously.

209
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,470
What a wide range of attack!

210
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,490
Don't falter!

211
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,680
That range means its force
and speed are weaker!

212
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,370
That hit hard!

213
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:30,690
Their blows aren't as bad as
that flashy black one before,

214
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:36,700
but each one possesses enough
force to steadily damage me!

215
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,820
Toudou! Let's match our timing better!

216
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,910
Yeah!

217
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,000
Our footing!

218
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,370
I messed up!

219
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:49,390
I thought it was passing cursed
energy through real objects

220
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,250
to manipulate that much mass!

221
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,360
But it's all the embodiment—
the manifestation of its cursed energy!

222
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,260
That's a special-grade for you!

223
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:01,140
Learn how great the land is!

224
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,090
Attacking while we fall? That's brutal!

225
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:04,890
However...

226
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,100
Brother!

227
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,500
They dodged that?!

228
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,470
But what...

229
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,820
What is this feeling?!

230
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:27,290
You know, Hanami,
you should be more honest.

231
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:31,250
I don't believe I'm faking anything.

232
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,550
I don't mean to call you a liar.

233
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,830
I know why you're fighting.

234
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,780
But it's the process.

235
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:44,810
You should enjoy the battles,
the present, much more.

236
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,250
Do you enjoy them?

237
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,570
Well, yeah.

238
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,810
Though...

239
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:57,570
It was only recently that the joy and pleasure
I feel in battle became my motive.

240
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,270
Before I knew it, I was tricking,
deceiving, and murdering,

241
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,830
and before I knew it, I felt fulfilled.

242
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:11,080
Just as humans eat, sleep, and screw,
I think that's a curse's instinct.

243
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:15,220
We may have gained reason,

244
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,260
but that doesn't justify
going against our instincts.

245
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:25,600
The soul is a blend of instinct and reason.

246
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:31,350
No one can say anything
about an individual's ratio.

247
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:35,600
But your soul's a little constrained.

248
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,680
Hanami, you're actually...

249
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,380
much stronger, aren't you?

250
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,260
Ow...

251
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,620
Toudou!

252
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,550
I'm fine!

253
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,270
It just expended so much cursed energy!

254
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,400
Now's our chance to strike!

255
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,520
You monster!

256
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,580
Mahito, right now...

257
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:32,770
I'm enjoying a fight!

258
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,960
You okay, brother?!

259
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,500
No problemo!

260
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,640
Excellent!

261
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,240
Then it's time to unleash my technique!

262
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,480
Juju Stroll

263
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,370
Coat rack!

264
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:23,360
Going to make a great coat rack!

265
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:29,280
Hey, what kind of coat rack
would Gojou Satoru be?

266
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,780
Probably a standing coat rack.

267
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:39,330
I'd use his hip bone with the sacral bone
and coccyx as the base for the stand,

268
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:42,530
then rework his femurs and
use them to stabilize it.

269
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,050
I'd use his spine's lumbar vertebrae,
thoracic vertebrae,

270
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:49,170
and up to the third cervical vertebrae.

271
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,220
To give it more height... let's see...
Ancient camphor wood would be good.

272
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:59,770
I could alternate ancient camphor replicas
with the bones to accentuate the height.

273
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,020
Then I'd extend the spinous process

274
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:08,670
and transverse process based on the
overall balance to create the hangers.

275
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,030
I'd do that by grafting on
more ancient camphor.

276
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:20,620
Depending on the coloring, it could be good
to cover the skull with tanned hide.

277
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,360
Nice! Very nice!

278
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,530
I'll be able to make a great coat rack!

279
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,930
No one needs it.

280
00:23:36,470 --> 00:25:24,950
Episode 20:
Nonstandard
