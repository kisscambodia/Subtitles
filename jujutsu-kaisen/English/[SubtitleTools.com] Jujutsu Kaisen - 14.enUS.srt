1
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,930
No!

2
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,150
Oh, there you are!

3
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,380
Jougo!

4
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,040
Looks like most of your body's back.

5
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,610
Yeah, this place is relaxing.

6
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,880
Humans don't come anywhere near it.

7
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,930
Lacking a body really is a problem.

8
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,790
It makes self-preservation so inefficient.

9
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:52,330
Mahito, you're awfully worn down yourself.

10
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,150
Oh, you could tell?

11
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,960
Sukuna and his vessel
are my natural enemies.

12
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,970
I started this game because
I happened to acquire a new toy,

13
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,890
but it just didn't go so well.

14
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,460
It was great at first, though.

15
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:12,470
Are you sure I shouldn't have just
used a hostage to force him into a pact?

16
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:17,100
Like, "Hand your body over to Sukuna
if you don't want to see him killed."

17
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,280
No, pacts are only placed
by oneself on oneself.

18
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,500
It's not easy to forge pacts with others,
or due to intervention from others.

19
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,770
Maybe I should have just given that thing
a lethal wound instead of transfiguring it.

20
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,650
Then Sukuna might have been able to heal
it with his reverse cursed technique.

21
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,000
Know your place, fool.

22
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,540
No, not with that personality.

23
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,810
I think he would have refused either way.

24
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,380
Jougo...

25
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,200
Touching Sukuna made me realize that

26
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,380
we should probably proceed
with Getou's plan for now.

27
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,460
Sukuna is that valuable.

28
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:08,820
Gather all the fingers and
offer them to Sukuna, huh?

29
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:15,980
Even if we're all wiped out in the process, eh?

30
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,480
Very well.

31
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,660
I don't need to be the one laughing
in the wasteland a century from now.

32
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,960
As long as curses stand there as
people, that's all that matters.

33
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,460
Oh, you get it!

34
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,000
Then first, let's go retrieve the
six fingers Jujutsu Tech has.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,420
Is that necessary?

36
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,640
The sorcerers are only
keeping Itadori Yuuji around

37
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,590
so he can take in Sukuna's fingers, right?

38
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,720
He'll still eat them, even if we leave them be.

39
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,610
The higher-ups at Jujutsu Tech

40
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,300
are struggling to measure
Itadori Yuuji's strength as a vessel,

41
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,710
to see how many he can take
before he goes berserk.

42
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:55,480
They won't let him take them in
until they've gathered all the fingers...

43
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,500
With just one exception.

44
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,740
Exception

45
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,740
I want to feed them to him right away!

46
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,960
And we can't wait that long, right?

47
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,390
Worst case, there's also a chance
they'll eliminate Itadori Yuuji.

48
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,500
Into the tiger's den, huh?

49
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,180
Well, what should we do, then?

50
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,000
I've already taken steps.

51
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,890
That's why I allowed Jujutsu Tech
to retrieve the fingers we had.

52
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,800
JUJUTSU KAISEN

53
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:02,440
Episode 14: Kyoto Sister School Exchange Event - Group Battle 0 -

54
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,400
Nanami, talk about something interesting.

55
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,880
Okay, I've got it!

56
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,380
Let's play catch with discarded rice balls

57
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,760
while discussing the separation of church and state!

58
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,010
Let's post a video of it and troll people.

59
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,030
Enjoy that on your own.

60
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,890
What kind of idea is that?

61
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,840
Drinking game time! Name things
you love about Gojou Satoru!

62
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,840
Everything!

63
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,310
Please keep that attitude going.

64
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,960
Itadori-kun needs that
kind of idiocy right now.

65
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,650
You'll take on and complete
several harder missions.

66
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,900
That wasn't what I meant by "harder," though.

67
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,210
Nanami, does Yuuji know about
that finger in Yoshino's—

68
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,380
I haven't told him.

69
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:57,220
Knowing him, he'd just feel
unnecessarily responsible.

70
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,920
I'm glad I left you in charge.

71
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,540
And the finger?

72
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,450
I submitted it to the higher-ups, of course.

73
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,990
If I gave it to you, you'd just
feed it to Itadori-kun, right?

74
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:09,750
Tsk.

75
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,530
But is it really okay to bring him back?

76
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,930
If the fact that he's alive becomes
known at the exchange event,

77
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,440
won't the higher-ups just target him again?

78
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,300
Even if they do, Yuuji will be just fine now.

79
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,950
You know that better than anyone, don't you?

80
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,000
Sensei!

81
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,660
Oh, Nanamin's here, too.

82
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,540
Well, c'mon!

83
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,040
Let's hurry up and go see everyone!

84
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,210
So excited!

85
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:41,630
"I thought you were dead..."
Touching Reunion
With Friends

86
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,720
So excited!

87
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,630
"Nice to meet you!!"
Deciding Factor of His First Impression,
First Meeting With the Second Years

88
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,060
So excited!

89
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,630
Kyoto Students Appear!!
Exchange Event Begins!
"Beginner's Guide to
the Exchange Event"

90
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,340
So excited!

91
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,660
Yuuji, are you planning to just show up
like normal after dragging it out this long?

92
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,180
Huh? I can't?!

93
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,290
Even among sorcerers,

94
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:55,370
you rarely see someone say they've actually
been alive two whole months after they died.

95
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,050
We have to make it a surprise!

96
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,670
A surprise?

97
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,890
Just leave it to me.

98
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,110
The first-years will be laughing
and crying from happiness and shock.

99
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,880
I'm so glad!

100
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,550
You're alive!

101
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,280
The second-years and Kyoto
students will cry with them.

102
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,710
Thank goodness! Thank goodness!

103
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,100
And someone among them
will choke up and vomit,

104
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:16,200
Blegh!

105
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,590
and in the end, it'll even solve global warming!

106
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,510
Cool!

107
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,010
Sweet!

108
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,340
What do I do?!

109
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,520
Sensei, what should I do?!

110
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,190
You don't have to do anything!

111
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,520
Just do exactly as I say,
and go with the flow!

112
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,620
So what should I do?!

113
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,480
Just go with the flow!

114
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,480
It'll be enough of a surprise
just to see he's alive.

115
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,970
Kyoto
Come have fun in Kyoto
The Complete Guide

116
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,970
What?!

117
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,980
Why are you all empty-handed?!

118
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,500
What are you doing with all that luggage?

119
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,690
What do you mean?
We're going to Kyoto, right?

120
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,820
Fortunes

121
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:51,010
For the exchange event
with our sister school in Kyoto?

122
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,430
It's an exchange event with
our sister school in Kyoto.

123
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,730
Held in Tokyo.

124
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,490
Ueno Specialty

125
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,490
Panda

126
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,950
No way!

127
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,220
What did I make all those
preparations for, then?!

128
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,220
No wonder our conversations
have been a bit off lately.

129
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,020
Yeah.

130
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,940
I was totally ready to go sightseeing!

131
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,010
Salmon.

132
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,780
It's held at the school that
won in the previous year.

133
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,950
This sucks! What a scam!

134
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,970
Then don't go winning, you idiots!

135
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,320
We weren't in it last year!

136
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,440
Only Yuuta participated to
make the numbers match up!

137
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,480
That was prior to freeing Rika.

138
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,650
Apparently, it was an overwhelming win.

139
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,760
I didn't see it, though,
since it was held in Kyoto.

140
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,180
I won't forgive you, Okkotsu Yuuta!

141
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,660
Not that I've ever even met you!

142
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,030
That's misdirected anger.

143
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,020
Salmon.

144
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,520
Hey.

145
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,480
They're here.

146
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,470
Oh, look. It's everyone from Tokyo together.

147
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,330
You went out of your way to greet us?

148
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,330
Disgusting.

149

Jujutsu Tech, Kyoto Second-Year

150
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,840
Okkotsu's not here.

Jujutsu Tech, Kyoto Third-Year
Toudou Aoi

152
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,850
Shut up. Hurry up and hand over the cake box,

153
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,140
and the yatsuhashi, kudzu noodles,
and buckwheat cookies.

154
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,240
Salmon.

155
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,850
You guys hungry?

156
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,040
Who is that first-year?

157
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,850
She's scary.

158
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,850
Jujutsu Tech, Kyoto Third-Year
Nishimiya Momo

159
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,120
Never mind Okkotsu being absent.

160
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,300
Isn't having two first-years a major handicap?

161
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,360
A robot! It's a robot!

Jujutsu Tech, Kyoto Second-Year
Ultimate Mechamaru

163
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,360
Age is irrelevant to jujutsu sorcerers.

Jujutsu Tech, Kyoto Third-Year
Kamo Noritoshi

165
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,370
Especially with Fushiguro-kun.

166
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,370
He's from the Zenin bloodline,

167
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,880
but he's more talented
than the head of the clan.

168
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,500
Tsk.

169
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,710
Something to say?

170
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,080
Nope.

171
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,300
Now, now...

172
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,220
Please calm down, you two.

173
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,210
Jujutsu Tech, Kyoto Second-Year
Miwa Kasumi

174
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,180
Okay, now.

175
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,140
Let's not fight amongst ourselves.

176
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,600
My goodness, these children.

Jujutsu Tech, Semi-First-Grade Sorcerer
Kyoto School Leader
Iori Utahime

178
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,100
So, where's that idiot?

179
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,770
Satoru's late.

180
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,580
As if that idiot would ever show up on time.

181
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,540
No one said "idiot" referred to Gojou-sensei.

182
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,540
Sorry for the wait!

183
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,040
Tsk. Gojou Satoru.

184
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,040
Gojou Satoru!

185
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,320
Hey, I see everyone's together.

186
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,330
I was on a business trip overseas.

187
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,970
So I will now hand out souvenirs!

188
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,430
This is sudden.

189
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,000
Sure it's not jet lag?

190
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,880
Okay, everyone from Kyoto gets this
protective charm from a particular tribe.

191
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,130
None for you, Utahime.

192
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,270
I don't need one!

193
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,300
And for everyone from Tokyo, we have this!

194
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,820
Overly excited adults are creepy.

195
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:33,080
Hey! OPP!

196
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,070
It's your departed friend,
Itadori Yuuji-kun!

197
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,080
Huh?!

198
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,580
Huh? Huh?!

199
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,540
They don't seem happy at all!

200
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,480
N-No way.

201
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,720
Okay, everyone from Kyoto!

202
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,690
This is Sukuna's vessel, Itadori Yuuji-kun!

203
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,550
Wh-What about the ones from Kyoto?

204
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,550
They're too absorbed in their souvenirs!

205
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,560
Sukuna's vessel?!

206
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,560
What's the meaning of this?

207
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,560
Jujutsu Tech, Kyoto School Principal
Gakuganji Yoshinobu

208
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,560
Principal Gakuganji!

209
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,560
Oh, thank goodness.

210
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:18,870
I was worried you might
just die from the shock.

211
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,080
You damn brat!

212
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,480
Hey.

213
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,120
Uh, yes?

214
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,160
You got something to say?

215
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,960
Huh?

216
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,950
I'm sorry for keeping quiet
about being alive.

217
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,010
Itadori Rejoins

218

00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,020
JUJUTSU KAISEN

220
00:11:55,270 --> 00:12:14,040
Jujutsu Technical High School
Tokyo-Kyoto Sister School Exchange Event

221
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:04,480
The Tokyo-Kyoto Sister School
Exchange Event will be held over two days.

222
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,300
The first day is a group battle...

223
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:14,040
Wacky
Cursed Spirit Exorcism Race

224
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,650
The Wacky Cursed Spirit Exorcism Race!

225
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,330
The rules are simple.

226
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,550
Second-Grade

227
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:21,170
The first team to exorcise
the second-grade cursed spirit

228
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:24,050
released in the designated area wins.

229
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,320
Several third-grade and lower cursed spirits
will be released into the designated area, as well.

230
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,120
If a winner is not decided by sundown,

231
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,060
the team that exorcises the most wins.

232
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,020
There are absolutely no other rules.

233
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,480
Of course, you're welcome
to sabotage the others,

234
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,330
but remember, you're all on the same
side in the fight against the curses.

235
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,800
This exchange event will allow
you to learn about yourselves

236
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,030
and your comrades through competition.

237
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:56,630
Be certain not to kill other competitors
or injure them beyond recovery.

238
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,420
That's it.

239
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,910
You're all dismissed until the
event commences at noon!

240
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:09,140
\hTokyo Side Meeting\h

241
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,130
Excuse me...

242
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,060
Depending on how you look at it,

243
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,990
this could be considered
very extreme bullying.

244
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,380
Shut up and stay that way for a while.

245
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,440
Now, now...

246
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,620
You heard his explanation.

247
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,170
Cut him some slack.

248
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,900
The panda talked!

249
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,280
Salmon, salmon.

250
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:26,860
What?

251
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,640
Inumaki-senpai is a cursed speech user.

252
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,330
Cursed speech is a technique that amplifies
the power and compulsion of words.

253
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,290
He limits his vocabulary to keep others safe.

254
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,220
So if he told someone to
go die, they'd actually die?

255
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,580
That's really powerful.

256
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,720
It's nothing that convenient.

257
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:46,120
It's all case by case, depending
on their difference in strength.

258
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,530
If he uses powerful words,
he's hit with massive feedback.

259
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,840
Worst case, it could affect him.

260
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:56,280
Limiting his vocabulary is a way
for Toge to protect himself, as well.

261
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,230
So how are you able to speak, Senpai?

262
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,700
Are you some new breed of panda?

263
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,240
Blabbing on about people's techniques...

264
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,270
It's fine.

265
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,510
Toge's isn't that kind of technique, anyway.

266
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,830
More importantly, Yuuji...

267
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,660
Give me back Slaughter Demon.

268
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,020
You borrowed it from Satoru, right?

269
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,380
Gimme!

270
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,150
Here you go!

271
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,590
I broke it.

272
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,060
It's not coming back!

273
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,880
Gojou-sensei... has it...

274
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,330
Tsk, that blindfolded dumbass!

275
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,320
Gross.

276
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,620
So, what's the plan?

277
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,810
The group battle format
is what we expected,

278
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,690
but we have another member now.

279
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,090
Do we change strategies?
There's not much time.

280
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,110
Bonito flakes.

281
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,620
Well, that depends on Yuuji.

282
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,230
What can you do?

283
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,100
Punch, kick...

284
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,980
We have enough of that.

285
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,070
Huh?

286
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:07,590
I don't know what he's been
doing since he's been dead,

287
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:12,360
but if everyone from Tokyo and Kyoto
fought him at once without cursed energy,

288
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,890
Itadori would win.

289
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,920
Oh?

290
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:20,630
Megumi's saying that after fighting Toudou?

291
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,230
That makes it convincing.

292
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,280
Interesting.

293
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,910
\hKyoto Side Meeting\h

294
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:35,920
Kill Sukuna's vessel, Itadori Yuuji.

295
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,920
He is not a person.

296
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,230
So it will go unquestioned.

297
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,250
It'll be treated as an accident.

298
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,920
There's no need to hold back or hesitate.

299
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,130
I don't want to...

300
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,960
You say to kill him,

301
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,920
but he's here because he didn't die, right?

302
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,930
I've heard that Itadori's
previous death was suicide.

303
00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:00,840
What is the one thing you must be cautious
about when ending a hostile sorcerer?

304
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,840
Kamo.

305
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:02,940
Yes.

306
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:06,240
You must kill them with cursed
energy to prevent them from

307
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,950
coming back as a curse after death.

308
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,450
Exactly.

309
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:14,020
If another delivers the finishing blow
with cursed energy, then all is well.

310
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,950
At present, Itadori Yuuji
has control of the body.

311
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:21,420
Unless Sukuna comes out,
he's just a first-year.

312
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,750
Killing him will be—

313
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,620
This is stupid. Do what you want.

314
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,090
Come back, Toudou.

315
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,090
The principal isn't finished yet.

316
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,010
Takada-chan's making a guest
appearance on a walking show at 11.

317
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,100
Do I need to explain any more?

318
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,600
You can record it. Come back here.

319
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,200
I'm going to watch the recording
and watch it in real time!

320
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,360
Who do you take me for?

321
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,980
That's your problem here?!

322
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,600
Listen, all of you.

323
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,650
You listen, too, old man.

324
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,660
I've long been disappointed in you all
and your bad taste in women.

325
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,340
Plot and scheme all you want on your own.

326
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,660
But if you try to order me around again,

327
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,680
I'll kill you.

328
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,380
What do we do now?

329
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:16,380
I don't think we'll be able to carry
out the plan with him like that.

330
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,810
The principal's gone off somewhere, too.

331
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,860
I don't want to be killed by that guy.

332
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,890
Does it even matter?

333
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:27,790
He's going to go straight
for the Tokyo team, anyway.

334
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,920
If he's just going to go berserk,

335
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,810
we can focus on the game.

336
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,790
But we have to kill Itadori Yuuji, right?

337
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,480
We're seriously doing this?

338
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,460
I don't think he'll go as far as killing him.

339
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,250
Though he probably could.

340
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,050
Then we'll need someone to
keep an eye on Toudou

341
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:50,480
and deliver the final blow to Itadori Yuuji.

342
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,410
I don't like this.

343
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,380
We'll have cursed spirits to deal with, too,
so we'll be in two-man cells anyway.

344
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,000
That works out for us.

345
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,230
No.

346
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,740
Allowing a half-wit like Itadori Yuuji

347
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:06,370
to be a sorcerer at Jujutsu Tech
is a serious problem.

348
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,770
One that goes beyond this exchange event.

349
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,820
I cannot overlook this as the
eldest son of the Kamo clan.

350
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,820
We're all attacking Itadori Yuuji together.

351
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:18,660
Hold on.

352
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:22,620
What happens if Inumaki-kun
is with Itadori-kun?

353
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,510
Having all of us in one place is a risky
move with that cursed speech user.

354
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:30,600
Worst case, he could
wipe us all out at once.

355
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,100
That's true.

356
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:38,140
No, if you know he's coming,
he's not that scary to face.

357
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,560
Let me have Maki.

358
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,640
That brown-haired first-year, too, if possible.

359
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:46,080
You're sounding just like Toudou.

360
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,520
So what did you want?

361
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,950
Huh? Why are you mad?

362
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,440
I'm not mad, actually.

363
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,630
Right? I haven't done anything, after all.

364
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:06,320
There's someone working with either
a curse user or curses at Jujutsu Tech.

365
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,910
Impossible!

366
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,310
A curse user might be one thing,
but working with curses?

367
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,880
A lot of them on that level
have been popping up lately.

368
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:19,380
They understand human speech, and they've
formed a faction that's operating with purpose.

369
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,890
They might think they're just
working with a curse user, but...

370
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:27,340
I'd like to ask you to handle
investigating those at Kyoto, Utahime.

371
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,360
What would you do if I was the traitor?

372
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:32,920
No way.

373
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,480
You're weak, and you don't have the guts—

374
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,630
Scary! Hysterics won't win men, you know.

375
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:43,450
I! Am! The senior here!

376
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,020
Itadori.

377
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,480
You okay?

378
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:55,260
Yeah, sounds like I've got
a big role, but I'll manage.

379
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,380
I'm not talking about that.

380
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,300
Something happened, right?

381
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,300
Huh? Nothing happened.

382
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,800
Okay, it did.

383
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,320
But it's true that I'm fine.

384
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:14,350
In fact, because of what happened,
I don't want to lose to anyone.

385
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,780
Okay, then.

386
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,200
I don't really want to lose, either.

387
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,980
What do you mean, "really"?

388
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,190
You already got sent rolling around once!

389
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,870
Overwhelm them!
Let's thoroughly trounce them!

390
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,170
For Maki-san's sake, too!

391
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,860
Don't say stuff like that.

392
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,980
Pollack roe.

393
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,130
Yeah! For Maki-san's sake, too!

394
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,130
Don't say stuff like that.

395
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,790
Well, in that case,

396
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,690
let's win!

397
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,990
What are you doing taking the lead?

398
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,010
Ow!

399
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,560
Juju Stroll

400
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,060
Sushi Eishuu

401
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:26,510
Hello! Today we're here at the
long-standing sushi shop, Eishuu!

402
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,330
You should do that kind of thing, too.

403
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:32,080
You'd be mad at me if I did.

404
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,080
Welcome.

405
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,380
What do you like, Takada-chan?

406
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,640
Goatfish! And room temperature sake!

407
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,310
They're great together!

408
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,750
How old are you again?

409
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,600
Huh?

410
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,480
How long have you been making sushi, boss?

411
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,780
I've been doing it since I was 20.

412
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:11,260
Which means... about 300 years?

413
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,870
Are you drunk?

414
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,870
Here's the goatfish you ordered.

415
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:21,900
Mm, it's so good!

416
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,970
Can I have yours, too?

417
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,380
Of course not.

418
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,920
Sorry!

419
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,570
Honestly, what are you thinking?

420
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,770
Well, it just looked so delicious!

421
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,270
She's drunk.

422
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,390
Tan, Taka-tan!

423
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,390
That's my Takada-chan.

424
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:38,640
Sensei, did you know "OPP"
actually stands for something?

425
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,540
Huh? It does?

426
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,240
Ocean Pacific Peace.

427
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,350
Seriously?

428
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:55,030
