Hey, are you listening?!

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,440
I told you! The auto-locking
door was left wide open!

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,680
Don't make me repeat myself!

8
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,470
I told you this last week, too!

9
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,070
Why am I paying such
high management fees?!

10
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,000
Huh?!

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,380
Screw you!

12
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,450
Do it today!

13
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,640
Come inspect it right now!

14
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,290
Are you even listening to me?!

15
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,440
I'll kill you!

16

37
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,650
Yamato Hiroshi in Nagoya, in September.

38
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,800
These three died in similar circumstances.

39
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,990
They were stabbed to death by a cursed spirit
at the entrances to their apartments,

40
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,330
and all of them had filed the same complaint

41
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,730
Jujutsu High Assistant Supervisor
Nitta Akari

42
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,130
with the property managers
several weeks before dying.

43
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,350
They claimed their auto-locking
doors were left wide open.

44

Episode 22: The Origin of Blind Obedience

45
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:36,030
Episode 22: The Origin of Blind Obedience

46
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,010
None of the other residents have
any idea what could have happened.

47
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,960
None of the dates or locations match, though.

48
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,450
Could the same cursed
spirit have killed them all?

49
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,010
Hey, could the cursed spirit
be responsible for the doors?

50
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,680
Do sensors like those pick up cursed spirits?

51
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,980
They don't show up on
cameras and stuff, right?

52
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:57,510
Apparently, the cursed spirit made the
door operators go crazy, not the sensors.

53
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,370
Oh...

54
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,110
Operators?

55
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,080
And as for whether or not the same
cursed spirit was behind this...

56
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,390
Well, we couldn't be certain
from just the residuals.

57
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,110
After all, a lot of time had already passed.

58
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,820
So we tried to track down any
connections between the three.

59
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,130
We found that all three attended
the same middle school for two years.

60
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:23,280
Meaning all three received the same curse,

61
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,800
and it activated after time had passed?

62
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,600
Precisely. That's highly likely.

63
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,160
So we're going to that middle school now

64
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,000
to question someone
the three victims all knew,

65
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,560
and I want you three to see
what you can find as sorcerers.

66
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,510
Way to go, Kugisaki!

67
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,240
Heh. What'd you expect?

68
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,270
Spirit
Lantern

69
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,730
Morishita Family
Funeral 11:00~

70
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,730
A funeral?

71
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,730
Is this the home of that acquaintance?

72
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,240
Yes, it is...

73
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,960
Well, this sucks.

74
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,670
He died the same way the other three did.

75
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,520
Morishita

76
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,930
He lived with his family,
so there was no auto-locking door,

77
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,670
but he was killed in front of the entrance.

78
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,130
Previously, upon returning home alone,

79
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,930
he reported, "The door was unlocked,
but it wouldn't open,"

80
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,140
to his other family members.

81
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,890
Saitama Municipal
Urami East Middle School

82
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,890
Congratulations,
Making it to Koushien!

83
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,620
I asked his parents, too,

84
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,160
but they said they didn't know what
relationship he had with the other three.

85
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,960
Man, there goes our only lead!

86
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,900
Don't worry!

87
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,400
There has to be something
at this middle school!

88
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,780
I sure hope so.

89
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,340
For now, I've secured an appointment
with a teacher, so I'm counting on you.

90
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,570
Roger.

91
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,790
There's some obvious punks.

92
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,360
Let's beat 'em up and set 'em straight!

93
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,040
Why?

94
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,630
Huh?

95
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,410
Huh?

96
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,050
I-It's good to see you!

97
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,120
Heh, look at that. You actually get it.

98
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,030
An aura just pours out,
even if you try to hide it.

99
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,350
We haven't seen you since
graduation, Fushiguro-san!

100
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,770
I... went here... for middle school.

101
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:32,790
Grinding

102
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,530
That's a surprise, too, but that's not the point!

103
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,600
Look at me!

104
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,500
What'd you do?!

105
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,400
What did you do in middle school?!

106
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,950
No, it would be quicker to ask them!

107
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,790
Hey, Idiot A and Idiot B!
What did this guy do to you?

108
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,290
We...

109
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:38,140
Or rather, every delinquent,
gang member, and so on in this area

110
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,520
got beaten up by Fushiguro-san.

111
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,550
I beat them up.

112
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,800
Why do you keep talking so stiffly?!

113
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:55,560
Grinding...

114
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,960
Look at me!

115
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,950
What are you doing?!

116
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,600
Hey! What are you doing?!

117
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,620
Hey!

118
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,040
Who are you? Students from other
schools aren't allowed in here!

119
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,810
And who the hell are you?!

120
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,360
He's clearly a staff member.

121
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,880
Why are you so combative?

122
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,820
We have permission to be here.

123
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,220
Oh, you're the ones?

124
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,350
You're all young.

125
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,630
You need to hang your pass around your neck.

126
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,330
Fushiguro-kun?

127
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,560
Hello.

128
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,840
He remembers you!

129
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,470
So this man's been here a long time?

130
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,650
Probably.

131
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,100
Takeda-san's a permanent employee.

132
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,890
Then I leave the rest to you!

133
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,440
Abandoning her duty...

134
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:37,600
Kanada, Shimada, Yamato...

135
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,230
and Morishita, huh?

136
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,420
I was shocked by their passing,

137
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,330
but I guess it's been nearly
twenty years since they graduated.

138
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,990
I remember it like it was yesterday.

139
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:55,990
They were problem children in their
own right, though not as bad as you.

140
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,350
What did you want to know?

141
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,050
Strange rumors, dark rumors,
connections to bad adults...

142
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,690
Hey, problem child!

143
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,340
...and anything of ill omen.

144
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,740
Dark rumors?

145
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,280
They may have been problem children,

146
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,970
but they never went beyond
average middle school stuff.

147
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,020
But wait... ill omen?

148
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,810
Do you mean that tale?

149
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,500
About the Yasohachi Bridge bungee jumping?

150
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,770
You're still here, A and B?

151
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,920
Yasohachi Bridge?

152
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,680
A notorious suicide spot.

153
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,260
It's well-known in this
area as a haunted location.

154
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,070
Oh, that's right! Back then, it was
all the rage among delinquents

155
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,240
to bungee jump off
Yasohachi Bridge late at night.

156
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,450
It was one of those tests of courage.

157
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,100
What a weird tribe.

158
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,640
I'm surprised there are people dumber than me!

159
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,320
What do you use for a cord?

160
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,540
We don't do it.

161
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,440
I just heard some students from our
parents' generation talking about it.

162
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:56,040
One day, Kanada and the other three
were absent without permission.

163
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:01,970
That wasn't all that unusual by itself,
but when we contacted their families,

164
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,140
we learned that those four hadn't
come home the day before.

165
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,170
It caused a pretty big stir.

166
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:12,480
Then they were found
unconscious under the bridge.

167
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,480
They got chewed out good,

168
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,470
but all four swore up and down
they didn't remember a thing.

169
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,830
I think that's it.

170
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,810
I've been to Yasohachi Bridge, too.

171
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,960
To bungee jump?

172
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,260
Ow!

173
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:32,840
It's easy for curses to take root in
haunted locations, just like in schools,

174
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,450
so people from Jujutsu High
regularly patrol it.

175
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,490
There wasn't anything unusual
at the time, though.

176
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,490
It might be a bit famous,

177
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,560
but it's still used as a normal bridge.

178
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,230
We still have to go check it out, though.

179
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,900
Yeah.

180
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,440
Fushiguro-kun?

181
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,200
Sorry, I was curious about something.

182
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,380
What is it?

183
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:58,320
Tsukimi-kun took awfully good care
of you when you were in school.

184
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,330
Is she doing well?

185
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,810
Yes.

186
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,840
Who's Tsumiki?

187
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,670
My older sister.

188
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,580
What?!

189
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,210
You tell us too little about yourself!

190
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,840
Yeah, that's right!

191
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,570
When they have cursed objects like these,

192
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,560
why don't they destroy them?

193
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,350
They can't destroy them.

194
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,650
Not when it comes to special-grades.

195
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:27,800
So they use a pact to put their life
on pause and prevent harm to others,

196
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,590
preserving their existence.

197
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,470
Sukuna's fingers cause harm, though.

198
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,500
That's an exception.

199
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,880
It's a monster that still
attracts curses over time,

200
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,100
even after becoming a cursed object
and divided into twenty pieces.

201
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,100
And because of that, it can choose its vessel.

202
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:51,110
Hmm... Then anyone works for these?

203
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,770
Hey, you.

204
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,210
Money?

205
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,490
Money, right?

206
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,010
I don't have that much!

207
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,640
But there are loan sharks and stuff, right?!

208
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,110
Will he work okay?

209
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,910
He still can't see me, even at this point.

210
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,650
He's seriously lacking in ability.

211
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,660
Here, say "ahh."

212
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,040
JUJUTSU KAISEN

213
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,020
JUJUTSU KAISEN

214
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,500
We're here.

215
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:46,000
Koi no Kuchi Canyon, Yasohachi Bridge.

216
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:49,750
Koi no Kuchi Canyon, Yasohachi Bridge

217
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,740
Once you confirm a cursed
spirit's here, I'll lower a veil.

218
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,710
Roger!

219
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,530
Hey.

220
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,710
Sorry to ask this right after you woke up,

221
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,390
but could you go run a little errand for me?

222
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:14,030
Hey, we didn't find hide
nor hair of any cursed spirit.

223
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,570
Spicy Cod Roe

224
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,220
We didn't sense any presences or residuals.

225
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:23,860
Pounded Fish Cake is finally here!

226
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,940
I see.

227
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,860
Which means this isn't it.
Guess it's back to square one.

228
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,440
But isn't it bad if we take too long?

229
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,590
Why?

230
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,870
Well, it's a famous haunted location, right?

231
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,140
There might still be plenty
of others who got cursed.

232
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,370
And right now, the death rate's at 100%.

233
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,190
We don't want to see any others die, right?

234
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,880
True.

235
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:47,890
Ding-ding

236
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,210
Ding-ding!

237
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,400
Bungee jumping was all the rage then, right?

238
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,880
So maybe the act of jumping off is the key?

239
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,650
Did she say "ding-ding"?
Did she really say that?

240
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,350
She did! She did!

241
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,900
Itadori already tried that.

242
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:55,890
Huh?

243
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:01,730
What?! You mean you jumped
with that vinyl cord?!

244
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,410
Gyaaah!

245
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,450
Hey, there you are!

246
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,760
Thank goodness!

247
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,680
Fushiguro-san!

248
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,930
Who's that again?

249
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,800
Fushiguro's underclassman.

250
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,080
Remember how much you picked on him?

251
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,790
You were talking about Yasohachi Bridge, so...

252
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,580
I'm really glad I found you here!

253
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,590
Fujinuma?

254
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,330
A classmate.

255
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,640
My older sister.

256
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:33,120
I'm glad you remember me.

257
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,600
Bank ATM

258
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:37,610
I was talking to my sister
about you yesterday, and...

259
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,870
Um, Morishita-san had a
funeral in the neighborhood...

260
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:48,620
Then I heard from my brother that you were
looking into that man and Yasohachi Bridge,

261
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,120
so I started wondering
if they were related...

262
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,200
If what's related?

263
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,960
Morishita-san's death and the bridge...

264
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,110
They're not related.

265
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,090
We're just—

266
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:02,890
I...

267
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,900
I went there.

268
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,170
In eighth grade... I went to
Yasohachi Bridge at night.

269
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,130
Geh.

270
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,100
Has anything odd happened at home recently?

271
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,810
Any strange feelings that only
affect you and no one else?

272
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,940
My family runs a local branch shop...

273
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:34,950
Mugiwara
Open for business

274
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,920
and the shop's automatic door is
wide open only when I come home.

275
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,050
Mom and Dad both say it's just a coincidence,

276
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:39,730
but there's definitely something there.

277
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,840
It scared me.

278
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:46,430
That's when I heard about you,

279
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:49,380
and remembered the Yasohachi Bridge.

280
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,690
When did the issue with
your automatic door start?

281
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:56,290
It's happened about every other
day for exactly one week now.

282
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:03,140
There's at least two weeks between when the
four victims noticed something and their deaths.

283
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,160
We still have some time.

284
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:09,240
You didn't go to Yasohachi Bridge
by yourself at the time, did you?

285
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,910
Do you remember who you went with?

286
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,910
Um, so this really does
have something to do with...

287
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,700
Just with your automatic door.

288
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,940
But it has nothing to do
with Morishita-san's death.

289
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:23,480
Fushiguro-kun and the others are
helping me with my college report.

290
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,600
"Electromagnetic Waves from Haunted
Locations and their Effects on Electronics."

291
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,530
It's a huge pain in my gut!

292
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:32,330
But I want to hear from all kinds of people,

293
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,850
so I'd love to hear who you went with.

294
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:38,340
We'd better save her,
after lying to her like this.

295
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,770
I went on a test of courage
with two others from my club.

296
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,930
That's right. Fushiguro-kun,

297
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:49,360
Tsumiki-san was with us then, too.

298
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:51,940
Tsumiki?

299
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,380
That's Fushiguro's sister!

300
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,040
I see.

301
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,620
Then I'll try asking Tsumiki, too.

302
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,600
Okay, then I'll escort these two home.

303
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,210
Please keep working on the report.

304
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,430
Something's up, isn't it?

305
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:10,220
I can't let you both go home on one bike!

306
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,640
Fushiguro.

307
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,390
Fushiguro!

308
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,560
Fushiguro, snap out of it.

309
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,360
Make sure she's safe first!

310
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,660
I'm fine.

311
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,960
Sorry, I'm stepping away for a sec.

312
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,450
I understand the situation.

313
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,340
A guard for Tsumiki-san, right?

314
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:52,090
But the only ones we have available
right now are second-grade sorcerers.

315
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,760
Second-grade...

316
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,960
Since the number of victims
far exceeds our estimates,

317
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,100
we'll have to re-evaluate
the curse's grade, as well.

318
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:07,380
You were probably assigned to this mission
with Itadori-kun's growth taken into account,

319
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,540
so if it's even more dangerous than that,

320
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,060
it might be too much for
a second-grade sorcerer.

321
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,670
It's just as dangerous
for all of you, as well.

322
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,400
Personally, I recommend you withdraw.

323
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,360
What do I do?

324
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,250
Do I go back by myself right now?

325
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,540
No, the mission was already
dangerous for all three of us.

326
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,560
I can't leave it to just the two of them.

327
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:34,010
Gojo-sensei will return next week.

328
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,960
I could ask him then...

329
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:39,490
No, I can't! The time limit
is the big problem!

330
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,250
This isn't the type of cursed spirit
that attacks someone.

331
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,990
It's the type that activates a cursed
technique from within a marked person.

332
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:48,880
So there's no point staying
nearby and protecting them!

333
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,810
I have to exorcise it right away!

334
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,890
Why were you talking to Ijichi-san?

335
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,990
Is your sister Tsumiki okay?

336
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,490
She's fine.

337
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,380
More importantly, this mission's
danger level just shot up.

338
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,000
Other sorcerers will be taking over this case.

339
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,000
You two can go home now.

340
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,920
Huh? Why?

341
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,850
Us two? What about you?

342
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,990
I'll go back after I say farewell to Takeda-san.

343
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:15,840
Now go!

344
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,320
Thanks for your help.

345
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,690
Is this Nitta-san?

346
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,610
There's something I want to ask you.

347
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,770
The procedure, right?

348
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:37,320
Fujinuma-san didn't go
over Yasohachi Bridge.

349
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,930
They held their test of
courage under the bridge.

350
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,020
Itadori went under it, too.

351
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,850
Most likely, you can't get
below it from up above.

352
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:50,260
The cursed spirit is within its barrier,
so the procedure's important.

353
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,780
You go at night, from underneath.

354
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,450
And one more thing...

355
00:17:55,290 --> 00:18:00,790
It's impossible to constantly keep a domain
imbued with a technique deployed forever.

356
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:05,410
Which means it's like that barrier
at the juvenile detention center...

357
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,230
an incomplete domain.

358
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,130
I'm actually lucky this time around,

359
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,030
since I won't need a veil.

360
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,160
You tell us too little about yourself.

361
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,030
Yeah.

362
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,430
You're seriously at your wits' end
if you didn't notice us until now.

363
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:30,340
We're not saying you have
to tell us everything,

364
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,800
but at least rely on us.

365
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:33,980
We're friends, aren't we?

366
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,520
Tsumiki's...

367
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,450
still bedridden.

368
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,790
The curse of Yasohachi Bridge
only appears before its victims.

369
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,660
Since she can't communicate herself,

370
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,340
I have no idea when she'll
be killed by the curse.

371
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,960
So I want to exorcise it right away.

372
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,590
But it's true that our mission's
danger level has increased.

373
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:15,230
Okay, okay, we get it now.

374
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,690
You should have told us that from the start.

375
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,940
The cursed spirit is within its barrier,
so the procedure's important.

376
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,650
You go at night, from underneath.

377
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,690
And one more thing...

378
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,690
At the bottom of the canyon,

379
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,500
there might be a river.

380
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,610
Crossing a river or other border—
acts that symbolize crossing to the afterlife—

381
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,010
carry important meaning in sorcery.

382
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,110
There it is.

383
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,230
This one will be rewarding to exorcise.

384
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,740
What's this? Someone beat me here?

385
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,750
Huh?!

386
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:29,250
Fushiguro, this one's
a different case, right?

387
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:30,750
Yeah.

388
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,980
Then you two focus on that other one.

389
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,760
I'll exorcise this one.

390
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,450
What?

391
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:43,270
You're going to play with me?

392
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,610
Juju Stroll

393
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,320
Help! It's a purse snatcher!

394
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:28,590
I run a Chinese restaurant.

395
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,520
Allow me to treat you as thanks.

396
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,870
We couldn't!

397
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:32,710
Are you sure?!

398
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:35,330
Thank you so much! I'll gladly eat!

399
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:40,920
Chinese Restaurant Manpuku

400
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,780
This restaurant has lasted four generations.

401
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:43,490
That was supposed to end with my father,

402
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:47,190
but I insisted and kept it running.

403
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:53,400
I wanted to keep this restaurant,
this flavor, around.

404
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,440
What a nice story.

405
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,430
Sorry for the wait. Here's our pride and joy,

406
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,700
the gyoza meal passed
down for generations!

407
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,410
Time to dig in!

408
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,280
Chinese Restaurant Manpuku

409
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,280
Thank you for the meal!

410
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,440
You two...

411
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,310
What do you think of gyoza
with no meat flavor,

412
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,630
that's basically just
cabbage and thickener?

413
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,570
I'm glad you said something, Fushiguro!

414
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,290
She was a nice woman, too!

415
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:23,420
She was a nice woman, but still!

416
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:28,680
But apparently, gyoza is meant to
be a vegetable dish, not a meat dish.

417
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,610
Seriously?

418
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,060
Episode 23:
The Origin of Blind Obedience - 2 -
