1
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,220
There's a bit of blood on the arrowhead.

2
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,800
Kamo-san's technique must be why
their paths can ignore physics.

3
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,870
You can call more than one type
of shikigami at a time, right?

4
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,820
Can't say I appreciate
you holding out on me.

5
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,460
My Demon Dog's busy with its task.

6
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,430
What about you? You're on
your last arrow, aren't you?

7
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,430
No one's helping you if
you pass out from anemia.

8
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,290
Blood Manipulation:

9
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,480
a technique that manipulates one's
blood and objects imbued with it,

10
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,460
fitting for one of the three major clans
and their love of bloodlines.

11
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,120
Don't worry about that.

12
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,520
These are all arrows
I prepared ahead of time.

13
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,210
Ten Shadows Technique:

14
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,250
one of the Zenin clan's
hereditary techniques.

15
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,460
It creates ten types of shikigami
using shadows as its medium.

16
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,310
If only Maki or Mai had
inherited that technique...

17
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,270
He has that much power?

18
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,450
Nice reaction.

19
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,040
But stay alert.

20
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,660
I was too slow to defend with cursed energy?

21
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:12,260
With this much speed and power,
it's like he's a different person now!

22
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,640
Manipulating blood isn't limited
to its shape and motion.

23
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,890
Body temperature, pulse,

24
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,700
red blood cells, and all
other components of blood

25
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,260
are mine to freely control.

26
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,670
Flowing Red Scale!

27
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,080
You're doping!

28
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,660
Very astute.

29
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,690
But I wish you wouldn't use
such a layman's term for it.

30
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,840
JUJUTSU KAISEN

31
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,010
Episode 18:  Sage

32
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:21,240
My sword was taken away from me.

33
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,860
Mai's older sister ran off somewhere.

34
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,930
That woman was fast, too.

35
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:33,750
Well, I'm not much of an asset without
my sword, so that was the right call.

36
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:37,150
I wonder if tapioca's as good as they say.

37
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,280
It's Mechamaru.

38
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,800
Hello, useless Miwa here.

39
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,200
Sleep.

40
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,440
Kyoto Sister School Exchange Event Group Battle
Miwa Kasumi — Retired

41
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,970
Miwa Kasumi

42
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,280
Return.

43
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,510
She fell asleep.

44
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,080
I'm heading out real quick.

45
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,730
Huh?

46
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,970
I can't leave her in the woods with
cursed spirits wandering around, right?

47
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,730
What's this?

48
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,780
The semi-first-grade cursed spirit
to be released in the area.

49
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:49,170
I thought they were releasing a second-grade?

50
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:52,110
I didn't think a second-grade would be enough.

51
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,840
We're not unified, you know.

52
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,410
Here's the scent and the
flute used in its training.

53
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:06,050
Depending on the situation,
use it well to kill Itadori.

54
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,220
It might get hunted down
before we can use it.

55
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,380
Fret not.

56
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,640
It's trained to keep quiet
until the flute is blown.

57
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,780
I know Kamo.

58
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,840
He probably placed the scent on Itadori

59
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,590
the moment they made
contact and the feed cut out.

60
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:30,250
It's easy enough for him to do
if he mixes his blood with it.

61
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,400
If the boy's fighting Toudou,
he won't come out unscathed.

62
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,420
If he's attacked by a semi-first-grade
the moment afterward...

63
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,160
he'll surely die.

64
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,480
That's true.

65
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,290
I'm worried about Miwa.

66
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,300
Go to her quickly.

67
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,370
Kelp.

68
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,320
?flesruoy yb llA .ym ,hO

69
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,600
Salmon, caviar, roe.

70
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,270
Well...

71
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,080
Time for us to go to work, too.

72
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,970
Let's make a coat rack.

73
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,960
Gojou Satoru's 190 centimeters, right?

74
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,650
That'll make a great coat rack.

75
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,920
JUJUTSU KAISEN

76
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,930
JUJUTSU KAISEN

77
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,550
Why is everyone so mean to Mother?

78
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,180
Because she's a slutty concubine.

79
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,310
Then why is everyone so good to me?

80
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,840
Why did you take me in as the heir?

81
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:29,700
Because his proper wife didn't bear
a boy who inherited the technique.

82
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,900
Then as the next head of the Kamo clan...

83
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,940
Shikigami users who can fight this
well in close combat are precious.

84
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,050
You've improved.

85
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,410
I'm happy.

86
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,340
What is this sense of fellowship
you keep throwing out?

87
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,550
I'm sympathizing.

88
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,680
Someday you'll be one of those
supporting the major clans.

89
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,870
I intend to kill Itadori Yuuji.

90
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,930
On Principal Gakuganji's orders?

91
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,650
No, it's my personal decision.

92
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,610
As a member of the Kamo clan,
one of the three major clans,

93
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,730
I believe that's the right call.

94
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,340
I must behave as the heir to the Kamo clan.

95
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,510
For my mother's sake.

96
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,170
You should be able to understand that, too.

97
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,200
You and I are the same.

98
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,410
No, we're not.

99
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,020
He's spouting some scary stuff all of a sudden.

100
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,690
We are.

101
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,530
We're not.

102
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,470
Please save those discussions for Maki-san.

103
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:14,230
I no longer have any connection
with the Zenin clan.

104
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:19,350
Besides, I don't believe I'm "right."

105
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,700
No, sorry.

106
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,340
That's not right.

107
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:27,700
I don't care if I'm right or wrong.

108
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,490
I just... have faith in my own good conscience.

109
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,530
I save people according
to my own conscience.

110
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,840
If you would reject that, then...

111
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,760
We'll just have to curse each other.

112
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,010
A shikigami?!

113
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,810
He still had more?!

114
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,360
He used the shikigami as a
decoy before releasing it?

115
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:05,160
This one burns through cursed energy,
so I can only use it by itself.

116
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,800
I only recently tamed it.

117
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,100
Max Elephant.

118
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:20,960
It's a big target!

119
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,120
I'll strike first!

120
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,000
Water?!

121
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,920
It drove me away with mass and pressure?!

122
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,950
Open spaces are bad!

123
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,180
That one's next!

124
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:40,510
Nue.

125
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,450
If I'm around, I'll just
be in your way, Noritoshi.

126
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,110
I—

127
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,520
Blood Manipulation:

128
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,630
Crimson Binding!

129
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,950
I can't afford to lose!

130
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,820
What is this?!

131
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,570
Inumaki-senpai?!

132
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,300
Run away.

133
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,330
Huh?

134
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,500
The game's over?

135
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,150
And they all burned red?

136
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,120
That's odd.

137
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,350
My crows didn't see anything.

138
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:50,590
I'd love to say Great Teacher Gojou's
students exorcised them all, but...

139
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,920
The charms will burn red
for unregistered cursed energy.

140
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:59,180
You think it's an outsider? Some invader?

141
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,070
Does this mean Tengen-sama's
barrier isn't functioning?

142
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,930
Whether it's an outsider or not,

143
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,930
something unexpected
is happening all the same.

144
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,550
They must be fairly skilled to exorcise that.

145
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,040
Who is it?

146
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,710
I'm going to Tengen-sama.

147
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,650
Satoru and Principal Gakuganji,
please protect the students.

148
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:27,410
Mei, you stay here and identify
the locations of the students.

149
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,290
Stay in constant contact with the other two.

150
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,270
Fully understood.

151
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,670
I look forward to the bonus.

152
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,780
Come on, Gramps! Time for a walk!

153
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,090
You just finished your lunch, didn't you?

154
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,080
Let's hurry.

155
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,790
They're really going at it.

156
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,170
But you know, those cursed spirits

157
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:16,020
don't leave anything behind when they die.

158
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,350
I can't make anything from them!

159
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,970
Was that good enough?

160
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,160
Oh, right, that.

161
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:34,050
Emerge from darkness, blacker than darkness.

162
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:37,350
Purify that which is impure.

163
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,300
Oh, good, good.

164
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,330
I can't wait for that coat rack.

165
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,310
A veil?! Why now?!

166
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,480
Gojou!

167
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,420
You go on ahead before the veil comes down!

168
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,040
No, not happening.

169
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,150
Huh?!

170
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,400
That veil's practically complete already.

171
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,900
They prioritized its effect on cursed
techniques over its visual effect.

172
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,580
They're good.

173
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,130
Well, now that it's down,
I just need to break it.

174
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,390
What's this odd feeling?

175
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,610
Hey...

176
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,990
Why are you being kept out

177
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,980
while I'm able to enter?

178
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,340
I get it now.

179
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,000
Utahime, Gramps, you go on ahead.

180
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,440
This veil...

181
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:10,140
is a barrier that allows
all others to go in and out

182
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:13,730
in return for denying Gojou Satoru entry.

183
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,210
True, that would make everything add up.

184
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,820
But if they're able to use a barrier
to keep a specific individual out...

185
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,840
They must have quite the skilled curse user.

186
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,990
That, and they have a degree of intel on us.

187
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,870
Go on, get moving.

188
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:38,980
I don't know what their goal is,
but we lose if even one of us dies.

189
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,060
What a strong curse presence!

190
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,010
Don't tell me a special-grade curse is here!

191
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,910
Hey, hey, hey!

192
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:58,410
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

193
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,880
Gojou Satoru's not here!

194
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,250
Curse user...

195
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,880
He's not the source of this presence,
but he's quite capable.

196
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,890
That degenerate monk tricked me.

197
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,700
Utahime, go on ahead.

198
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,860
Protecting the students is our priority.

199
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,240
Avoid fighting as much as possible.

200
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,860
Hey, hang on!

201
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:26,120
At least let me kill the woman!

202
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,530
I can't make anything from an old
man's hollow bones and wrinkled skin!

203
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:34,940
Why don't you kill me

204
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,700
and find out if they're hollow?

205
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:44,690
Go off and drink some milk first, old fart.

206
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,130
Why is there a cursed spirit at Jujutsu Tech?

207
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,850
Who does this veil belong to?

208
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,540
Probably the curse user working
with that cursed spirit.

209
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,730
Do you know something?

210
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,690
These are unregistered
special-grade cursed spirits.

211
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,650
And it looks like they're
working with a human, too.

212
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:17,540
I think it's the special-grade cursed spirit
that attacked Gojou-sensei before.

213
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,310
Its appearance matches the report.

214
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,500
I can tell, even from that guy's drawing.

215
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:25,800
Tuna with mayo.

216
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,370
You're right.

217
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,520
Let's contact Gojou-sensei.

218
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,630
Hold on.

219
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,150
You can understand what he's saying?

220
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,630
That doesn't matter right now.

221
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,460
Our opponent might use a domain.

222
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,960
Maintain our distance
and retreat to Gojou-sensei—

223
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,150
Don't move!

224
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,250
Blood Manipulation:

225
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,620
Slicing Exorcism!

226
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,510
No damage?!

227
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,240
It's really tough.

228
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,270
That sword...

229
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,400
Where has he been hiding it?

230
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,720
.nerdlihc hsiloof ,ti potS

231
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,770
Stop it, foolish children.

232
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,490
What is this?

233
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:35,520
I can't tell what it's saying by the sound,
but I can understand its meaning?

234
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,490
This feels creepy.

235
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:42,250
I merely wish to protect
this planet, that's all.

236
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:45,320
It's a curse spouting nonsense! Don't listen!

237
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:48,920
This is on a whole different level
than lower-grade cursed spirits.

238
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,310
The forests, the oceans, and the sky

239
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:55,180
all weep so vehemently that
I can no longer stand it.

240
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:59,510
It's impossible to coexist
with humans any longer.

241
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:04,780
They know there are some humans
who are kind to the planet.

242
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:08,490
But how much does their affection even help?

243
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,520
It's established its own language system!

244
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:17,030
All they desire is time.

245
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,290
Get Inumaki out!

246
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:26,350
This planet can shine blue
once more, given a bit of time...

247
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,300
Time without humans.

248
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,520
Please die and become sages.

249
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:17,440
Juju Stroll

250
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,440
Hey, Jougo-kun!

251
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,750
You burned up Hanami's
flower bed again, didn't you?

252
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,480
Hanami's crying!

253
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,450
Hmph.

254
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,650
Hanami,

255
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:40,120
let's strangle Jougo-kun.

256
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:46,300
My boyfriend's senpai
is totally one of those.

257
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:49,290
No, that's too far...

258
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,850
Th-This is... a slash-and-burn farm!

259
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,760
The soil didn't have enough nutrients before!

260
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,170
Throb...

261
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:54,930
Episode 19:
Black Flash
