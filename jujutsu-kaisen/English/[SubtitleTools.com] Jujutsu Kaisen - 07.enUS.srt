1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,050
We have a bit of time before your
appointment with the principal.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,650
Did you want to stop anywhere?

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:09,680
It's fine.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,900
I'll show up early for a change.

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:16,930
Stop the car.

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,660
Huh? Right here?

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,730
Go on ahead.

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,840
Huh? A-Are you testing me?

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,280
You're not going to hit me if
I actually go on ahead, are you?

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,150
Just what do you think I am?

11
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:29,680
In that case...

12
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,540
Now...

13
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,040
Who are you?

14
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,570
That was easier than I expected.

15
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,220
Who are you...

16
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,140
calling easy?

17
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,700
Brat.

18
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,000
He's a cursed spirit, but he
can communicate clearly.

19
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,880
And the sheer amount of cursed energy...

20
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,770
An unregistered special-grade?

21
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,950
He's likely stronger than Sukuna currently is.

22
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,190
Special-grades are classified
as such because they're special.

23
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,810
Having them pop up this frequently
throws everything off.

24
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,720
Did I wound your pride?

25
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,490
Nope.

26
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,700
I'm starting to find this fun.

27
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:26,990
Jujutsu Kaisen

28
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:47,640
Episode 7:  Assault

29
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,760
Finding this fun, you say?

30
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,260
No sense of danger at all.

31
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,720
He chose a place devoid of people?

32
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,090
No, he was avoiding other
sorcerers coming to back me up.

33
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,010
Ember Insects!

34
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,440
Well, if you're coming
after me, you're right...

35
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,350
about having no sense of danger.

36
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,060
What happens if this hits me?

37
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:19,860
Sound?

38
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,930
A two-stage attack of sound and explosions?

39
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,990
That's clever.

40
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,190
There's more!

41
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,120
That's all it took?

42
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,840
I took a look for myself, and it was
just an overestimation by the weak.

43
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,070
That human was just as fragile as the rest.

44
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:00,530
He wasn't living a life of truth.
It's all so nauseatingly repulsive.

45
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:06,420
I'm going to go spread real strength,
the truth, through death.

46
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,180
We just went over this a moment ago.

47
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,960
Can't you even learn? Ugh, this smoke...

48
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,920
What's the meaning of this?

49
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,900
To put it simply, you didn't hit me.

50
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,820
Impossible. That wasn't like before.

51
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,350
I know I touched you and killed you.

52
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:32,350
You touched the "Infinity" that
exists between you and me.

53
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,850
I'll show you.

54
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,870
Put your hand out.

55
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,360
Come on, come on.

56
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,850
Come on, come on, come on.

57
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,480
No hostility? I guess I'll see what it's about.

58
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:56,640
See?

59
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,400
I can't touch him?

60
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,970
It stops just before him.

61
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,930
This is Infinity?

62
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,920
You're not exactly stopped,
but the closer you get, the slower you go.

63
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,400
So, what now?

64
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,360
We could just shake
hands like this, you know.

65
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,860
I refuse.

66
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,860
Don't be shy, now.

67
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,540
You're making me embarrassed, too.

68
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,780
Damn you!

69
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,890
He's fast!

70
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,810
It's not just a blow
strengthened by cursed energy!

71
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,620
What is this?!

72
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,730
I don't get it!

73
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,050
I have to know!

74
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,450
There's still more!

75
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:50,460
Infinity exists everywhere.

76
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,960
My jujutsu just brings it forward in reality.

77
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,840
Convergence, divergence...

78
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,980
What do you think happens
when one touchs this void?

79
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,900
Cursed Technique Reversal: Red.

80
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,420
Oh, this is perfect.

81
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,660
You can try,

82
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,180
but you'll die, Jougo.

83
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,390
It wasn't just talk.

84
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,480
No matter. If I can't hit him,
I'll just drag him into my Domain.

85
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,980
Where did he go?

86
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,600
Sorry about that.

87
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,880
Where the heck?! Hey, where are we?!

88
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,640
Were you waiting?

89
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,990
That's...

90
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,700
Sukuna's vessel?!

91
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,900
This is Itadori Yuuji-kun,
and he's here to watch.

92
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,160
Mt. Fuji! His head's Mt. Fuji!

93
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,470
I'll protect you.

94
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,430
I'll never leave you.

95
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,620
Sam...

96
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:02,320
Wow, he learns surprisingly quick.

97
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:03,900
Come on.

98
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,610
Yuuji.

99
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,230
Gojou-sensei?

100
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,240
Talking to him doesn't
cause a problem, either.

101
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,800
You need something?

102
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,700
Looks like we'll be able to increase his output
quickly and move on to the next stage soon.

103
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,630
We're heading out, Yuuji.

104
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,460
Huh?

105
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,090
It's an extracurricular lesson.

106
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:27,190
I'm going to teach you about the pinnacle
of jujutsu battles, Domain Expansion.

107
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,880
Why aren't we sinking?!

108
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:39,660
Sensei, I was at the school
just ten seconds ago, right?

109
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,810
What's going on here?

110
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,160
Oh, we warped here.

111
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,320
He has no intention of explaining.

112
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,060
Sukuna's vessel...

113
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,140
So he really is alive.

114
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,830
You have to render Gojou
Satoru incapable of fighting.

115
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,970
The second is to get Ryoumen Sukuna
and Itadori Yuuji on your side.

116
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,390
I can't kill Itadori due to our future plans...

117
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:04,550
Has he caught on to our goals?

118
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,440
What's the brat for? He a shield?

119
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,610
A shield? No, no.

120
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,920
I told you, he's here to watch.

121
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,460
I'm in the middle of teaching
this boy lots of things.

122
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,550
Don't worry about him. Just keep fighting.

123
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,920
Bringing in someone who will slow
you down just makes you a fool.

124
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,360
It'll be fine. After all...

125
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,150
you're weak.

126
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,870
Don't underestimate me, brat!

127
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,610
I'm going to enjoy swallowing
up that smug face of yours!

128
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,200
This guy...

129
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,310
is weak?

130
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:58,910
He's way more monstrous than any of
the monsters I've encountered so far!

131
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,290
You'll be fine.

132
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,730
Just stay close to me.

133
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,970
Domain Expansion!

134
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,740
Wh-What is this?!

135
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,200
Coffin of the Iron Mountain!

136
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,930
Jujutsu Kaisen

137
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,940
Jujutsu Kaisen

138
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,670
Wh-What is this?!

139
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,260
This is Domain Expansion.

140
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:11,730
You use cursed energy to
construct an Innate Domain

141
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,060
Ow, hot!

142
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:11,830
Hot, hot, hot!

143
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,030
imbued with a cursed technique
in your surroundings.

144
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,980
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

145
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,960
What you all experienced at
the juvenile detention center

146
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,430
was an incomplete Domain that hadn't
been imbued with any cursed techniques.

147
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,280
If that had been a proper Domain,
all of you first-years would have died.

148
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,560
I think Megumi understood that.

149
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,250
Spreading out a Domain
consumes a ton of energy,

150
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,410
but its merits are worth the cost.

151
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:40,080
One such benefit is the boost to
stats due to environmental factors.

152
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,810
Oh!

153
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,730
Like buffs in video games!

154
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,240
Another is...

155
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:54,750
Most sorcerers would have burned to ash
the moment they entered my Domain!

156
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,800
...that the techniques imbued in the Domain
are guaranteed to hit within that Domain.

157
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,390
Guaranteed?!

158
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,760
Guaranteed.

159
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,440
But don't worry. There are
several ways to deal with it.

160
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,770
You can take the hit using a
cursed technique, like just now, or...

161
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,840
I don't really recommend this one,

162
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,910
but you can go outside the Domain.
That's usually impossible.

163
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,180
You can also...

164
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,550
If I neutralize that Infinity
of yours with a dense Domain,

165
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,610
then my techniques will reach you.

166
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,370
Yeah, they'll hit.

167
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,370
Huh? Infinity?

168
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,420
Give me the Prison Realm!

169
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,190
I'll add it to my collection.

170
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,750
I came here half in jest.

171
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,130
I thought I wouldn't care if I couldn't kill him.

172
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,680
But having this difference
between us thrust in my face...

173
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,760
On my pride as a cursed spirit,

174
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:56,070
as the new humanity,
this is completely unacceptable!

175
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:59,990
The most effective way to deal with a Domain

176
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,830
is to lay out your own Domain.

177
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,580
When two Domains are
laid out at the same time,

178
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,590
the more refined one
will dominate that space.

179
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,580
Though, sometimes, compatibility and
the amount of cursed energy are factors.

180
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:19,040
There won't even be ashes
left of you, Gojou Satoru!

181
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,140
Domain Expansion:

182
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,100
Infinite Void.

183
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,310
What just happened?

184
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:02,470
Was my Domain overwhelmed?

185
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,790
I can't see anything.

186
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,230
I can't feel anything.

187
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,240
No...

188
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,570
I can see everything!

189
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:12,880
I can feel everything!

190
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,910
But the information is never complete...

191
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:20,650
So I can't do anything!

192
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:25,070
This is the inner world of Limitless.

193
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,150
Perception, communication...

194
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:33,460
Every action involved in living is forcibly
carried out an infinite number of times.

195
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,730
It's ironic, isn't it?

196
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:40,480
When granted everything,
you can't do anything...

197
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,960
but just die peacefully.

198
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,430
But I have questions I want to ask you,

199
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,860
so I'm letting you off the hook with this.

200
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:09,730
Now, who told you to come after me?

201
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,960
He really is the strongest jujutsu sorcerer!

202
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,740
As a living organism,

203
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,090
he's on another level!

204
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,710
Oh, dear.

205
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,000
What now?

206
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,650
Will you rescue him?

207
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:33,370
I can't let people from the school see
my face, so I'll be going home now.

208
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,410
If you want to save him,
go ahead and save him.

209
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,670
Though I don't know if your
kind have such emotions.

210
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:47,520
We do. We're the true humans, after all.

211
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,210
Quite the statement for
a cursed spirit to make.

212
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,390
You don't seem like the type to act on orders.

213
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,850
Was something good supposed
to happen if you killed me?

214
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,080
Regardless, I want to know. Who was it?

215
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,190
Come on, just tell me already.

216
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,050
Like I'd ever tell you, brat!

217
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,760
You sure you should be saying that?

218
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,050
Damn you!

219
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,480
Hurry up and tell me, or I'll exorcise you.

220
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,080
Of course, I'll do that either way.

221
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,530
Wait, curses are capable
of holding conversations?

222
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,680
It seemed so normal, I overlooked it.

223
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,470
Wow!

224
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,230
Flowers!

225
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,160
Pretty!

226
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:46,800
That is a curse, right?
It's stripping away my will to fight.

227
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,780
Sensei, I'll be fine!

228
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,910
Go after him!

229
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,230
Sorry, I lied! Help!

230
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,030
Wow.

231
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,790
He got away.

232
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,030
He's good at hiding his presence.

233
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,250
He's way creepier than Volcano Head.

234
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:26,250
I'm sorry about that.
They managed to escape because of me.
Though you're the one who brought me here, right?
- Yuuji

235
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,450
I'm sorry about that.

236
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,420
So cursed spirits of that level
are forming a faction now?

237
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,950
They managed to escape because of me.

238
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,250
Though you're the one
who brought me here, right?

239
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,260
This is getting interesting.

240
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,780
Yuuji.

241
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:32,620
I want you—or rather, everyone—
to become strong enough to beat that.

242
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,180
Huh? Beat that?

243
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,020
It's better to have a concrete goal, right?

244
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:41,010
Man, I'm glad brought you here.

245
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:43,960
I had no idea what was going on, though.

246
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,200
Are you serious?

247
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,500
Now that we've set your goal,
all that's left is to pursue it.

248
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,610
We'll speed up the schedule a bit.

249
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:56,200
For the next month, you'll be
watching movies and fighting me.

250
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,630
Fighting you?!

251
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,720
Will I still be alive a month from now?

252
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,810
After that, it's practical combat.

253
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,580
You'll take on and complete
several harder missions.

254
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,070
You'll learn the basics
and how to apply them,

255
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:12,690
and then you'll show them off
at the exchange event.

256
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,000
Hey, Sensei!

257
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,630
Yes, Yuuji-kun?

258
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,630
What's the exchange event?

259
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,770
I didn't tell you?

260
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,320
He's late!

261
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,800
Sure is peaceful here.

262
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,250
How's Jougo doing, Getou?

263
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,500
On death's door.

264
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,040
Hanami stepped in to save him,

265
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,720
so he'll probably be fine.

266
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,740
How irresponsible.

267
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,450
You're the one who egged him on.

268
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,390
Heavens, no.

269
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,080
I tried to stop him.

270
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,660
Speak of the devil.

271
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,890
Jougo, Hanami.

272
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,910
Glad to see you're safe.

273
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,930
How can you say that when you see me like this?!

274
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,180
You're lucky you got off with just that.

275
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,440
Why, you...

276
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,890
I think you understand now...

277
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,270
So we'll go about sealing Gojou Satoru
at the appropriate time,

278
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:53,380
in the appropriate place, once we've secured our advantage over him.

279
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:57,010
We'll carry it out on October 31st in Shibuya.

280
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,410
I'll contact you with more details later.

281
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,320
Good enough, Mahito?

282
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,530
Cloud Giant

283
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,160
No objections here.

284
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,250
Let's be cunning about this.

285
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,240
Like curses should.

286
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,320
Like humans should.

287
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,470
Juju Stroll

288
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:51,080
One, two, three, four...

289
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,450
What are you doing?

290
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:53,610
Brazilian calisthenics.

291
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:54,480
Three, four...

292
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,900
I think we're nice and warmed up now.

293
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,890
Yeah.

294
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:02,280
What are you two planning to do?

295
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:13,750
Getou-kun!

296
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,570
Shoot!

297
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,400
Mahito-kun!

298
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,540
Overhead!

299
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,610
Shoot!

300
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,710
I'm gonna kill these two later!

301
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,270
Tokyo Metropolitan
Jujutsu Technical High School

302
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,950
Episode 8:
Boredom
