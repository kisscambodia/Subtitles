1
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:27,230
Don't look inside me without
permission. I hate it...

2
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,230
Brat.

3
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,900
Then come down from there,

4
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,610
and I'll look down on you!

5
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:51,020
Jujutsu Kaisen

6
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:12,730
Episode 6:  After Rain

7
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,920
You're being awfully hostile, aren't you?

8
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,600
Damn straight I am.

9
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,890
You just killed me.

10
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,300
This is the thanks I get for fixing your arm?

11
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,930
Yeah, and you ripped out
my heart right after that!

12
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,150
Is this Hell?

13
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,090
I'm not sure I can accept being
stuck with you even after death.

14
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,980
This works out, though.

15
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,270
I'll make you cry!

16
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,130
Hope you're ready for this!

17
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,250
He was aiming for where I stood?

18
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,590
You fell for it!

19
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,870
I got you!

20
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:04,810
Huh?

21
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,590
Man, you're boring.

22
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,130
I thought I landed that one perfectly!

23
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,330
Damn it!

24
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,000
This isn't the afterlife.

25
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,740
It's my Innate Domain.

26
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,630
Innate Domain?

27
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,770
That thing Fushiguro was talking about?

28
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,330
You could also say we're in my mind.

29
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,190
In other words, we're not dead yet.

30
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,130
If you'll accept my conditions,

31
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,730
I'll fix your heart and bring us back to life.

32
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,470
Cocky bastard.

33
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:41,070
You act all big, but I know
you don't want to die, either.

34
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,600
The situation's changed.

35
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,800
In the near future,

36
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,570
I'll be able to see something interesting.

37
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,420
I have two conditions.

38
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:56,660
One: when I chant "Extension," you'll
hand over your body for one minute.

39
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,860
Two: you'll forget this promise.

40
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,960
No way.

41
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,050
I don't know what your goal is,
but it's shady as hell.

42
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,330
After what you did this time, I finally get it.

43
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,850
You're evil.

44
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,170
I'm not lending you my body again.

45
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,810
Then I'll promise that I won't kill or
injure anyone during that minute.

46
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:17,850
So annoying.

47
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,630
Like I can believe you!

48
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,830
It's not about whether you believe me or not.

49
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,400
This is a pact.

50
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,220
A geas.

51
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,790
I'll be the one punished if I break it.

52
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,930
If you pursue selfish gain beyond
your means, you'll earn retribution.

53
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,870
I'm pretty sure you've
experienced that for yourself.

54
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,040
It wasn't a problem before!

55
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,290
Huh? Oh...

56
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,060
That time I wanted to switch, too.

57
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,430
And you were just doing
as that sorcerer told you to.

58
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,620
A pact founded in mutual interest.

59
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,670
That's one of the key factors
behind all jujutsu.

60
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,300
Fine, then. So move.

61
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,750
I'll accept your conditions.

62
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,460
I don't know what you're trying to do,

63
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,410
but it means I'll come back to life!

64
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,270
Like hell I'd say that. Bring me back
to life without any conditions.

65
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,260
It's your fault I died in the first place.

66
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,050
Then how about this?

67
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,790
We'll fight to the death, and if you win,
I'll do it without conditions.

68
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,000
If I win, you come back
to life under my conditions.

69
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,040
Sure! I'll beat you to—

70
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,480
You know,

71
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,700
I have a bad personality.

72
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,510
I know.

73
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,460
Ijichi, expect a hard forehead flick later.

74
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,320
F-Forehead flick?

75
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,220
Being a teacher isn't my style.

76
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,490
Do you know why I decided
to teach at this school?

77
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,850
Ask me.

78
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,230
Why did you?

79
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,690
Because I have a dream.

80
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,630
A dream?

81
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,570
Yup.

82
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:12,880
As you can see in this case with Yuuji,
the top of the jujutsu world is a den of vice.

83
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,480
Conservative fools. Traditional
fools. Arrogant fools.

84
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,590
Just plain fools.

85
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,240
It's a bargain sale on rotten mikan.

86
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,240
I want to reset that garbage jujutsu world.

87
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,800
Murdering everyone at the
top would be an easy task.

88
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,240
But they would just get replaced.
It wouldn't bring a revolution.

89
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,690
And if I did that, no one would follow me.

90
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:41,540
That's why I chose education.

91
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,480
To raise up strong, clever comrades.

92
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,990
That's also why I occasionally
tossed my missions to my students.

93
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:51,950
It's tough love.

94
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,750
Are you sure you don't
just want to slack off?

95
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,640
They're all talented.

96
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,500
Especially the third-year, Hakari,
and the second-year, Okkotsu.

97
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,800
They'll become jujutsu
sorcerers on a par with me.

98
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,180
Yuuji was one of those, as well.

99
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,940
Hey, you two.

100
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,960
I'm about to get started.

101
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,620
Are you just gonna watch from there?

102
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,910
Whoa, I'm completely naked!

103
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,950
G-G-G-Gojou-san!

104
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,940
H-H-H-H-H-H-He's alive!

105
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,560
Ijichi, be quiet.

106
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,460
I'm kind of disappointed.

107
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,440
Um, I'm embarrassed to ask, but who are you?

108
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,350
Yuuji!

109
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,930
In the meantime,
put this on!

110
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,520
Welcome back.

111
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,980
Yeah. Good to be back!

112
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,100
Ugh, I'll have to revise the reports.

113
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,750
No, leave them as-is.

114
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,920
I want to give Yuuji time to gain the minimum
power necessary before he's targeted again.

115
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:58,170
Sorry, Shouko, but could you leave
Yuuji listed as dead on the records?

116
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:02,100
So you plan to keep Itadori
completely hidden away?

117
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,420
No, I'll have him make his comeback
in time for the Exchange Event.

118
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,160
Why?

119
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,600
The reason is simple.

120
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:12,770
No one's allowed to take the events
of youth away from young people.

121
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,100
I bet everyone will be surprised.

122
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,010
Not anyone.

123
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,060
Starting right now, I'm ditching work.

124
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,160
I've always had a strong
sense of responsibility.

125
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,030
Onii-chan.

126
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,160
I've been saving up my earnings so I can
send my four younger sisters to college, too.

127
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,440
Aniki.

128
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,160
Niini.

129
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,510
Onii-sama.

130
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,950
But even I can't fight my survival instinct.

131
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,220
If I go near that table, I'll die!

132
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,200
Gojou Satoru.

133
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,680
I wonder if we could kill him
if we joined forces.

134
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,970
Either he'd flutter out of your grasp,

135
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,560
or worst case, you'd all get exorcised.

136
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:54,670
I would recommend you pour energy
into sealing him rather than killing him.

137
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,160
Seal him?

138
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,390
Do you have a lead?

139
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,490
We'll use the special-grade
cursed object, Prison Realm.

140
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,160
Prison Realm?

141
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,920
Table 5 hasn't ordered anything at all.

142
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,580
Someone go hurry him up.

143
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,320
He's taking up a whole table by himself.

144
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,300
Sorry, boss, but I quit!

145
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,490
Huh? What?!

146
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,650
Hey! Hold on a minute!

147
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,760
You have that detestable thing?!

148
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,990
Our AC is running, isn't it?

149
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,800
Jougo, don't get too excited.
You'll make it hot in here.

150
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,500
Sir, have you decided on your order?

151
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,810
I wish you wouldn't cause
too much commotion.

152
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,760
This is hardly anything.

153
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,530
What the...

154
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,880
I'm glad we didn't choose
an expensive restaurant.

155
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:11,110
Getou, how strong am I
in terms of Sukuna's fingers?

156
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,550
At a low estimate,
I'd say eight or nine fingers?

157
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,560
That's plenty. Give me the Prison Realm!

158
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,970
I'll add it to my collection.

159
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,590
In return, I will...

160
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,460
kill Gojou Satoru.

161
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,220
Help—

162
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:39,030
Jujutsu Kaisen

163
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,040
Jujutsu Kaisen

164
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,030
By the time we arrived on the scene,

165
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,580
your son was already dead.

166
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:56,550
To be honest, I was skeptical about
saving any of the people in there.

167
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,540
But my friend was different.

168
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,600
He wasn't successful,

169
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:07,100
but he tried to bring your son's body back
for you after we confirmed his death.

170
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,310
Please.

171
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,520
Okazaki Tadashi

172
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,090
Take this, at least.

173
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,870
Okazaki Tadashi

174
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:30,320
I'm sorry we weren't
able to save Tadashi-san.

175
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,340
It's all right. Don't apologize.

176
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:40,920
I'm the only one who will
mourn his passing, anyway...

177
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,730
You're late, Megumi.

178
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,930
Kelp.

179
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,170
What were you doing?

180
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,530
What does it matter?

181
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,480
Zenin-senpai...

182
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,960
What kinds of people do you want
to save as a jujutsu sorcerer?

183
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,630
Huh?

184
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:07,630
It's not like I care if my actions save anyone.

185
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,090
I shouldn't have asked.

186
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:09,820
What?!

187
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,420
Fushiguro!

188
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,920
Quit asking interview prep questions!

189
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,900
Switch with me!

190
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,440
I'm sick of these school uniforms!

191
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,000
Let me go buy some cute tracksuits!

192
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,770
Here we go!

193
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,030
What are those two doing?

194
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,360
Falling practice.

195
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,240
Mustard leaf.

196
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,320
You're both weak in
close quarters, after all.

197
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,670
So first...

198
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,020
Land a blow on us.

199
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,600
We'll talk after that.

200
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:43,420
You're a head above the rest when
it comes to close combat, Yuuji.

201
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,050
So what you need to learn right now

202
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,030
is how to control cursed energy,

203
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:50,290
as well as the bare minimum
of jujutsu knowledge.

204
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,790
Smile

205
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,470
What's the matter?

206
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:58,250
ee-hee

207
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:58,260
Oh, I figured you'd be the best person
to train me, so I'm just happy.

208
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,300
I'm weak, and I couldn't save anybody.

209
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:05,110
Worse, I nearly killed Fushiguro.

210
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,600
As I am now, I won't be able to face them.

211
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,360
I want to become strong.

212
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,720
Teach me to be the strongest.

213
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,190
You've got a keen eye.

214
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,880
Sensei, you're the one who
called yourself the strongest.

215
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,120
All right, first, take a look at
those drink cans over there.

216
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,120
This is with cursed energy,

217
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,130
and this is with a cursed technique.

218
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,270
I see. I don't get it.

219
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,120
Right, well...

220
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,390
Think of cursed energy as electricity,

221
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,580
and cursed techniques as appliances.

222
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:51,110
Electricity by itself is hard to use, right?

223
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:56,000
That's why we run electricity through
appliances to achieve various results.

224
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,710
Here, I just fired off pure cursed energy.

225
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,140
Here, I channeled cursed energy
into a cursed technique

226
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,500
to activate it and twist the can with jujutsu.

227
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,080
In other words, I'm about to learn
a very, very good cursed technique?!

228
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,500
No, you can't use cursed techniques.

229
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,730
Huh?!

230
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:17,860
Setting aside simple shikigami and barriers,

231
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:22,260
cursed techniques are fundamentally etched
into your body from the day you're born.

232
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:28,180
So the power of a jujutsu sorcerer
is roughly 80% innate talent.

233
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,400
You okay?

234
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:36,630
I just thought I'd be able to pull off thunder
or fire or a power bomb or something.

235
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,980
You can pull off a power bomb. Ohnita's, right?

236
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,450
This sucks.

237
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:48,990
I wanted to pull off a Spirit Gun or
Bankai, or Rasengan, or a Dodon Ray.

238
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,540
You just can't use them yet.

239
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:52,950
Eventually Sukuna's cursed techniques
will be engraved into your body.

240
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,770
I wanted to fire off a Kamehameha.

241
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,590
Let's just ignore what you can't do!

242
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,330
We're going to enhance your strengths.

243
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,650
This totally sucks.

244
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,910
We'll get you to imbue your
fighting style with cursed energy.

245
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,070
I'm way more scared of someone

246
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,240
who can force their way through with
the basics than I am of inferior jujutsu.

247
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,760
Like I just said, your talent
for close combat is top-notch.

248
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,920
But wait! I can already do that!

249
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,520
Get up.

250
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,710
Back then, I somehow managed
to get the hang of it.

251
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,210
Then give it a try.

252
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,830
Hit me here.

253
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,320
Not that you actually can.

254
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,560
Don't blame me if you get hurt.

255
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,080
Just hurry up and do it.

256
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,750
That didn't have any
cursed energy behind it.

257
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,990
How?!

258
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,670
Negative emotions are
the source of cursed energy.

259
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:43,040
In the incident you're referring to, you were
probably brimming with anger and fear.

260
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,020
So you have to constantly be
flipping out to use cursed energy?

261
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,770
Now that you mention it,
Fushiguro's always a bit snappy.

262
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,100
Demon Dogs!

263
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,520
Not like that.

264
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,240
What's the matter?

265
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,000
I just got really irritated.

266
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,600
Huh?

267
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,020
No, not at you.

268
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,650
Salmon roe.

269
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:05,610
There's only a month and a half until
the Exchange Event, so no dawdling.

270
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,100
Here, you can try the long one next.

271
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,550
This actually feels pretty good.

272
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,540
Everyone's trained to produce cursed
energy using the faintest sparks of emotion.

273
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:24,670
They've also trained on how to not waste
cursed energy when emotions are flaring, too.

274
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,750
There are several methods to train this.

275
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,310
I'll be having you use
a pretty exhausting one.

276
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,300
L-Like what?

277
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,610
Watching movies.

278
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,100
Watching movies?

279
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,620
Yup.

280
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,350
Everything from masterpieces to C-grade
horror films and terrible French movies.

281
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,570
You'll be watching them nonstop
as long as you're awake.

282
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,810
Of course, you won't just be watching them.

283
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,280
You'll be watching them with this guy.

284
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,650
What's with the cute but creepy doll?

285
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,400
It's cute?

286
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,650
It's a cursed corpse the principal made.

287
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,170
Ah, I knew it! It has his sense!

288
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,320
And? I don't understand
what you're getting at here.

289
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,820
Don't be hasty, now. You'll see soon.

290
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:16,280
That cursed corpse will wake up
and attack you, just like that,

291
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,850
if you don't keep pouring a set
amount of cursed energy into it.

292
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:21,310
Ow!

293
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:25,450
Like I just said, we have all
kinds of movies available here.

294
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:28,080
Heart-throbbers, thrillers, exciting ones,

295
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,570
ones that'll make you cry,
laugh, or feel disgusted.

296
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,320
Yawn

297
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,660
Your first goal is to watch an entire movie,

298
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,080
from start to finish,
without waking the cursed corpse.

299
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,070
Num   Num

300
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,520
This trains you to maintain a steady

301
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,330
output of cursed energy,
no matter what emotions you feel.

302
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,560
You can't use too much or too little.

303
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,960
I have it set to the faint level of cursed
energy you can produce right now,

304
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,500
but it'll steadily start
demanding greater output,

305
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,440
so don't let your guard down.

306
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,410
I couldn't let it down even if I wanted to.

307
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,690
What do you want to start with?

308
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,210
I recommend this one.

309
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:06,180
The heroine's annoying,
but she dies spectacularly in the end.

310
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,850
Major spoilers.

311
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,840
I say we start off with an action—

312
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,420
Oh, come on!

313
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,790
Hey, even if you're irritated,
keep the cursed energy steady.

314
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,070
Carrying cursed tools, huh?

315
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,880
I agree with supplementing
my close combat with weapons,

316
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,610
but with my cursed technique, I want to
be able to free up both hands at any time.

317
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,340
With swords, you lose time sheathing them.

318
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,020
Zenin-senpai, you often carry more
than two around with you, right?

319
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,240
How do you do that?

320
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,000
I make Panda carry them.

321
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,300
I shouldn't have asked, part two.

322
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:44,620
Some sorcerers keep cursed spirits
that can store and retrieve objects.

323
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,720
He can't do that. It's a rare thing.

324
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,950
And it takes time to tame them, as well.

325
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,990
But if you find any, let me know.

326
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,690
A year's supply of Calpas.

327
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,760
I don't get it, though.

328
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,400
Why...

329
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,920
did you run back then?

330
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,000
What a waste of talent.

331
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,790
I have the potential to beat special-grades?

332
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,780
Is that what he meant by that?

333
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,530
Tuna, tuna.

334
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,130
Huh? What?

335
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,270
Senpai.

336
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,480
I think I can do it.

337
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,900
Ura-Hara! Where's Ura-Hara?!

338
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,610
Underground?!

339
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,300
Do I cut the red wire or the blue wire?

340
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:43,880
You know, in the area where I used to live,
the designated trash bags...

341
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,920
Hey, what are you going on about right now?

342
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,860
...were red for plastic trash
and blue for combustible trash.

343
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,370
I always thought, shouldn't it be the opposite?

344
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,380
It should be red! Anyone would go with red!

345
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,390
I'll trust you.

346
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,030
Don't do that while I'm drinking soda!

347
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,280
Don't drink it, then.

348
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,030
But you gotta have chips and soda
when watching movies at home!

349
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,400
That's true.

350
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,090
Okay, I have some business to deal with.

351
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,800
Just keep hanging in there.

352
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,190
Will this really make me stronger?

353
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,340
Oh, right.

354
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,600
Did you talk to Sukuna while you were dead?

355
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,040
Talk?

356
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:44,920
When he fixed your heart, did he
propose any conditions or contracts?

357
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,520
Oh, I think we did talk about something...

358
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,530
But I can't remember what it was.

359
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,720
I see.

360
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,850
We have a bit of time before your
appointment with the principal.

361
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,380
Did you want to stop anywhere?

362
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,520
It's fine.

363
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,700
I'll show up early for a change.

364
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,840
Stop the car.

365
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,260
Huh? Right here?

366
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,410
Go on ahead.

367
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:18,400
Huh? A-Are you testing me?

368
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,960
You're not going to hit me if
I actually go on ahead, are you?

369
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,940
Just what do you think I am?

370
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,390
In that case...

371
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,550
Now...

372
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,000
Who are you?

373
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,610
Juju Stroll

374
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,140
Gojou Satoru's Go Go Gojou

375
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,140
It's Gojou Satoru's Go Go Gojou!

376
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,820
Today we're at my alma mater,

377
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,740
Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu
Technical High School.

378
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,710
Satoru-sensei

379
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,300
Oh? We already have a boy in trouble.

380
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,760
Yuuji

381
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,670
Is he a new student?

382
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,740
It looks like he can't produce
cursed energy very well.

383
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,890
Let's give him some advice.

384
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,070
Imagine you're walking down a narrow path.

385
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,980
Before you is a row of college boys.

386
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,760
They haven't noticed you at all.

387
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,060
You want to kill them, don't you? So you...

388
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,060
Shut up.

389
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:55,070
Episode 7:
Assault
