1
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,810
JUJUTSU KAISEN

2
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,000
Maki?

3
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:38,490
Episode 17: Kyoto Sister School Exchange Event - Group Battle 3 -

4
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,570
She's just a weakling.

5
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,360
She can't even see curses.

6
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,910
She's just a normal person
swinging around cursed tools.

7
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,040
She's forever a fourth-grade.

8
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,710
Why is she even a jujutsu sorcerer at all?

9
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,980
Break's over.

10
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,590
Okay.

11
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,710
I see.

12
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,180
That's a relief.

13
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,260
Stupid Mai!

14
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,800
This woman is incredibly strong!

15
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,420
She's using a longer weapon,
so I'd like to close the distance,

16
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,460
but it's all I can do
to dodge and parry her!

17
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,360
If she were using the blade,

18
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,690
I would've died twice!

19
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,410
She's only fourth-grade?!

20
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,460
She could easily defeat
second-grade cursed spirits!

21
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,210
And how is she able to swing such a long sword
in this forest with so much stuff in the way?!

22
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,170
New Shadow Style: Simple Domain!

23
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,390
This allows me to attack anything that
enters the 2.21-meter radius of my domain

24
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,340
on full-auto reflex.

25
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,660
It's released if my feet move from
the point they're at when it's activated.

26
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,400
On top of that,

27
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,020
my Quick Draw is specialized
against enemies attacking head-on.

28
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,430
It's the fastest technique of the
New Shadow School, wrapping my blade

29
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,300
in cursed energy while it's in
the sheath to accelerate it.

30
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,560
But don't think this will settle the match.

31
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,960
Focus my full strength
on creating an opening first.

32
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,420
Iaijutsu, huh?

33
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,680
Looks like she has some trick, too.

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,870
But there's a difference in our reach.

35
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,130
Rather than hit me, she likely wants to knock
away my cursed tool and create an opening.

36
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,760
In which case...

37
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,300
She broke it?!

38
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,440
She's throwing away her
reach advantage now?!

39
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,900
She threw it?!

40
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:34,480
A hidden weapon?!

41
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,360
Her intuition's sharp!

42
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,370
She's trying to close the gap with a decoy!

43
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,790
My legs moved!

44
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,830
But that's fine. I'll pull back and
draw her in just close enough, then—

45
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,440
Aikidou?! What a clever woman!

46
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,840
Huh?

47
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,920
Nice sword you've got here.

48
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,250
Sword-stealing?

49
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,930
Give it back?

50
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,520
What an interesting girl.

51
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,970
You should promote her
to second-grade already.

52
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,400
I feel the same way,

53
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,820
but the Zenin clan keeps getting in the way.

54
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,020
They should just change their
position and accept her already.

55
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,100
I just can't understand such
restraints, aside from money.

56
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,200
I see you're just as miserly as ever.

57
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,540
More importantly, the footage showing
the area around Yuuji keeps cutting out a lot.

58
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,860
Animals are fickle.

59
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,290
Sharing my senses with them is tiring, too.

60
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,590
Huh? Is that true?

61
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:42,170
Let's be blunt. Which side
are you on, Mei-san?

62
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,480
Which side?

63
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,630
I'm on money's side.

64
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,440
There's no value to anything
that can't be traded for money.

65
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,530
You can't make money out of it, after all.

66
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,010
Just how much have you saved up?

67
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,190
I don't know what he's planning,

68
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:02,280
but it won't be that easy to
deal with Yuuji anymore.

69
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,570
Oh, they're moving.

70
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,030
All the cursed spirits released
into the area have charms on them,

71
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,300
and when the cursed spirit disappears,

72
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,290
Curse

73
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,380
the corresponding charm here, in the viewing
area, is extinguished simultaneously.

74
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,720
Each charm is extinguished
differently according to

75
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,130
the cursed energy registered beforehand.

76
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,720
Tokyo

77
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,730
When the Tokyo school
exorcises one, they burn red.

78
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,430
Kyoto

79
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:32,430
When the Kyoto school
exorcises one, they burn blue.

80
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:38,400
Since Maki-san is in the match, any extinguished
by unregistered responses burn red, as well.

81
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,400
Tokyo

82
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,870
One to one, huh?

83
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,590
No one's paying enough attention to the game.

84
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,520
Why can't they just get along?

85
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,400
They must take after you, Utahime.

86
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,990
You're the only one I have an issue with!

87
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,840
By the way, Panda-kun's
the one who exorcised it.

88
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,750
Lucky!

89
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,580
Get down here, you damn witch!

90
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,000
I've come down a few times already.

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,970
Hurry up and try to catch me, first-year!

92
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,540
Her cursed energy wind
is strong enough to lift me!

93
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,920
It hurts like hell when pebbles
and branches get caught in it, too!

94
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,340
If I drop my guard, it'll gouge my flesh!

95
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,030
How dare you hurt my precious face?

96
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,270
A scar on the face is a
badge of honor for a man.

97
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,160
Though it's only a flaw on a woman.

98
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,400
Huh?

99
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,990
You think being a jujutsu sorcerer
is all about strength, don't you?

100
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,750
And it actually is.

101
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,200
That's only for men.

102
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,040
Huh?

103
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,140
Even if they are strong, women have to
be cute, or they'll be undervalued.

104
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:51,640
Of course, even if they're cute, they'll still
be undervalued if they're not also strong.

105
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,390
Do you get it?

106
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,890
They don't demand strength
from female jujutsu sorcerers.

107
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,440
They demand perfection!

108
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,840
And on top of that,

109
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,270
Mai-chan is also fighting against
even more outrageous demands.

110
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:10,460
I get that you're a pain in the ass!

111
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,880
She's only a first-year, and she's
already used to fighting?

112
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,800
She's still going strong,
no matter how often I blast her.

113
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:30,590
I'm used to getting knocked around.

114
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,210
If I up my output any further,
I might kill her.

115
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,130
No, that's just an excuse.

116
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,610
The main reason I can't attack her

117
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,000
is Inumaki-kun.

118
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,160
Cursed speech uses the power of words.

119
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,240
It imbues cursed energy into sound,

120
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,110
so you just have to protect your brain
and your ears with cursed energy.

121
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,110
Cursed speech is a technique specialized
for use against cursed spirits.

122
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:59,750
Like I said before, it's nothing for a sorcerer
to be afraid of if you know it's coming.

123
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:05,250
Conversely, if you don't know whether or not
it's coming, you're constantly distracted.

124
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,680
I'm not used to protecting the inside
of my head in the first place...

125
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,970
He's such a nuisance whether he's here or not!

126
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,560
All done with your lecture?!

127
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,010
Perfection is easy compared
to what's demanded of Mai-chan!

128
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:27,840
She's from the Zenin clan, one of the three major clans of elite jujutsu sorcerers.

129
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,700
Perfection is expected
as a matter of course there.

130
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,330
"Inherit the Zenin clan's
hereditary technique."

131
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:38,650
Any who don't meet that demand start their sorcerer lives as failures.

132
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:43,920
Among those, women aren't even
allowed to stand at the starting line.

133
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:47,820
Without the Zenin clan lineage,
they're not considered jujutsu sorcerers.

134
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,140
And if they're not jujutsu sorcerers,
they're not considered people.

135
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:56,510
She's lived her entire life with such scorn
in a family without a shred of affection.

136
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,140
Can you imagine how much
Mai-chan and others suffered

137
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,270
just to obtain what we
enjoy as a matter of course?

138
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,820
Why don't you try thinking that
over with that brain of yours

139
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,480
that confuses curses for friends?

140
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,430
Shut up.

141
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,520
You think misfortune is
a free pass to do anything?

142
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,860
What, then?

143
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,460
You're satisfied with those who are blessed
getting trash-talked behind their backs?

144
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,080
That's how Saori-chan...

145
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,640
I can't stand her,
regardless of her upbringing,

146
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:39,340
and I love Maki-san, who
endured the same upbringing.

147
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,560
Have you all even bothered to
think about what kind of person

148
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,430
the idiot you're trying to curse is?

149
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,530
What makes us obligated to meet such
perfection or such absurd demands?

150
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,820
Is your entire life just a job?!

151
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,080
Straw Doll Technique: Hairpin!

152
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,420
This is why she kept shooting those
nails that didn't land any hits?!

153
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,050
Tsk!

154
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:28,520
You might have brought me down,
but you still won't reach me!

155
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,360
No, I reached you.

156
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,150
This is plenty!

157
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,900
My broom's bristle?

158
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,400
She grazed it just now?

159
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,370
I don't give a damn about
"men" this and "women" that!

160
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,380
You can keep that shit to yourselves!

161
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,840
I love myself when I'm pretty
and all dressed up!

162
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,920
And I love myself when I'm being strong!

163
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,640
I am...

164
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,480
Kugisaki Nobara!

165
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,350
I can't control my broom!

166
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,470
If I hit her with my hammer,
I might kill her.

167
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,150
So...

168
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,110
A squeaky hammer?!

169
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,200
One more time!

170
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,590
Just barely within effective range.

171
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:38,010
I'm so glad it hit.

172
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,010
JUJUTSU KAISEN

173
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,010
JUJUTSU KAISEN

174
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,970
Hello? Momo?

175
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,200
Don't worry, it was a rubber bullet.

176
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,410
More importantly, that light
was Ultimate Cannon, right?

177
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:01,280
But I can't get in touch with Mechamaru.

178
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,250
If he was cornered enough to use such
a powerful technique, and now this,

179
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,910
he most likely lost.

180
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,320
Panda will likely be returning.

181
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,950
You should leave that spot and
support everyone from the air.

182
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,690
We're all in trouble without you.

183
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,070
Yeah.

184
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,510
Mai-chan, I...

185
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,850
It's all right, Momo. I know.

186
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,920
Yeah.

187
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,020
What, not going to call your friends?

188
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,810
I don't mind going two-on-one.

189
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,740
There are many ways to enjoy this, right?

190
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,530
I could have everyone beat you together,

191
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,710
but I'd like to enjoy you...

192
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,780
by myself.

193
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,740
Call me "Onee-chan," little sister.

194
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,630
What do you think of Maki-san?

195
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,710
She'll be mad no matter how I answer!

196
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,250
I-I think she's a wonderful woman.

197
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,270
Huh? I'm talking about as a sorcerer.

198
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,880
Oh, that? Good...

199
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,600
Honestly, I still don't know
that much about jujutsu,

200
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,400
but she's really strong in a fight.

201
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,760
Maybe it's her balance? The way
she walks is scary on its own.

202
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,160
Maki-san's a fourth-grade.

203
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,060
Huh? Seriously?

204
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,420
Her family's an annoying clan of sorcerers,

205
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,670
so after she kind of
emancipated herself and left,

206
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,000
they've been interfering with her promotion.

207
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:32,960
I thought families of jujutsu sorcerers
welcomed powerful sorcerers.

208
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,030
They won't acknowledge what
they've already rejected,

209
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,500
because they're idiots.

210
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,620
But if she performs well
at the exchange event

211
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,440
and her name gets spread around,

212
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,380
it'll be harder for them to harass her like that.

213
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:50,010
So let's start by winning the group battle!

214
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,970
Fight like you're going to die again!

215
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,100
Sure.

216
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,810
I can hear you.

217
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,340
Jeez.

218
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:03,070
I shouldn't let myself get distracted.

219
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:06,380
What are you smiling about?!

220
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,450
So what if she hides out of sight?

221
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,040
Is she an idiot, trying
to gain distance from me?

222
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:22,630
Tsk!

223
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,000
From below?!

224
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,260
I already knew.

225
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,770
Maki has a talent I don't.

226
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,970
Have you heard about Ougi's daughters?

227
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:41,490
One can't even see curses,
let alone use techniques.

228
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,770
Twins are a sign of ill fortune.

229
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,870
This might actually be a good thing.

230
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,930
I couldn't bear to see
an eldest son as a servant.

231
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,880
Mai.

232
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,370
What's the matter? Hurry up.

233
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,670
No.

234
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,190
What is it?

235
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,770
We'll get in trouble if we're late again.

236
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,380
They're there.

237
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,400
Again?

238
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:18,270
All right, fine.

239
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:23,280
Are you ho... ho...

240
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,770
Come on.

241
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,780
Close your eyes.

242
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,280
Huh?

243
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,320
If you can't see them,
it's the same as if they're not there.

244
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:36,280
You've always acted like you had no fear

245
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:40,060
and plowed forward toward your future.

246
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,530
I hated you.

247
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:47,130
You're leaving the clan, Maki?

248
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,920
You have plenty of servants, right?

249
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,600
Don't worry, though. I'll come
back someday, Clan Leader.

250
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,940
Why would you return?

251
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,980
Because I'm going to be
the head of the Zenin clan!

252
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:09,400
Then I'll put you through
ordeals befitting that!

253
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,700
Do as you please.

254
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,290
And Mai, as well.

255
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,360
She has nothing to do with this.

256
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,960
Liar.

257
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,520
I hate you!

258
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,070
You fired six shots!

259
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,270
I won't let you reload!

260
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:30,240
I hate you!

261
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,730
Which is why

262
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,670
I never told you about my first love

263
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,100
or my technique!

264
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:50,090
"Construction" uses one's cursed energy
to create matter from nothing.

265
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,380
It differs from the manifestation

266
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,000
of an innate domain within the
barrier of a domain expansion.

267
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,080
The matter produced by Construction doesn't
disappear when the cursed technique ends.

268
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,980
Because of that, it consumes
a lot of cursed energy

269
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,970
and puts a heavy strain on the body.

270
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,140
Creating one bullet a day is Mai's maximum.

271
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:18,130
That's why she uses a revolver to create
an obvious bluff of her bullet count.

272
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,160
I win.

273
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,310
She caught the bullet?

274
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,550
Ow...

275
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,600
I shouldn't touch that with my bare hands.

276
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:45,310
Maki has a talent I don't.

277
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,210
She's similar to Mechamaru,

278
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,510
with a Heavenly Pact that's
somewhat the opposite.

279
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,440
Normally, she would have been
born with a cursed technique.

280
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,600
But in exchange for that,

281
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,880
she was granted superhuman
physical abilities.

282
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,080
The Zenin clan wouldn't acknowledge it.

283
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:08,780
That talent I lacked.

284
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,050
I think we can call this settled?

285
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,300
Why did you leave the clan?

286
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,160
Huh? Do I have to spell it out?

287
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,050
You joined Jujutsu Tech
yourself, didn't you?

288
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,060
I...

289
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,340
never wanted to be a jujutsu sorcerer!

290
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,170
It's your fault!

291
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,930
Because you tried so hard to be one,

292
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:34,190
I was forced to put forth effort, too!

293
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,110
I'm so sick of trying so hard,
facing pain and scary things!

294
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,920
What was so bad about being
ordered around back home?!

295
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,940
We could have just done a few
chores and lived a normal life!

296
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,480
Why wouldn't you stay at
the bottom with me?

297
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:06,280
Because I would have
hated myself if I did that.

298
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,240
That's the only reason.

299
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,170
Sorry.

300
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,520
Onee-chan, don't let go!

301
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,140
I won't let go.

302
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,400
Never?

303
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,730
Jeez, give it a rest.

304
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:26,900
Never leave me behind.

305
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,480
Of course I won't.

306
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,540
We're sisters.

307
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,630
You liar.

308
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,640
I hate you.

309
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:45,010

Juju Stroll

312
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,020
I'm hungry.

313
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,790
If I recall, the edamame I had left over
from lunch was in the fridge...

314
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,430
Sorry.

315
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:49,920
Please look at least a little guilty!

316
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:56,680
Seafood

317
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,810
Here, have this and forgive me.

318
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:56,680
No, I'm not interested
in late-night cup ramen.

323
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:03,690
Seafood Cup Ramen

324
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:03,690
Arrangement!!

325
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,690
Nishimiya-style Seafood Cup Ramen arrangement!

326
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:07,150
One: use scissors to chop up hot chili peppers

327
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,840
into the seafood cup ramen!

328
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:13,230
Two: fill the container halfway with milk.

329
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:16,410
Three: add hot water up to the line inside!

330
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:19,640
Since we're using milk,
make sure the water's boiling hot!

331
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,960
I-It's good!

332
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,650
This is really good!

333
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,820
Right?

334
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,960
Maybe I'll try it next time, too.

335
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,930
You could've just eaten
this if it's so good.

336
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:42,300
Well, you still pay for late-night
cup ramen the next day.

337
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,390
Uh-huh.

338
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,990
