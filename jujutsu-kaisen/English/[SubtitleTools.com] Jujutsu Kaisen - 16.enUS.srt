1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,460
The hands will never surpass the eyes.

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,690
Unless you cultivate the "eyes"
to discern good from bad,

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,690
Class Check
~Production~

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,690
Correct Answer Waiting Room

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,700
you cannot hope to improve the
"hands" that create works of art.

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,830
It's a phrase that's often
used among creators,

7
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,500
but it applies to all kinds of fields.

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,710
Those with good "eyes" will improve

9
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,750
far more rapidly than those without!

10
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,560
When I throw my right horizontal punch,

11
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,650
he immediately sends a left vertical jab!

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,030
Itadori wasn't moving like that before!

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,480
He's improving...

14
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,570
by devouring me!

15
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,660
What a beautiful way to knock me down!

16
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,660
His face is wide open!

17
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,620
I can hit it!

18
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,040
Even with Divergent Fist!

19
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,960
However!

20
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,400
He stopped my fist with his forehead
before it could reach full speed?!

21
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:19,050
That's not what I want you
to devour right now.

22
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,430
Your Divergent Fist

23
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,930
is created by your cursed energy

24
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,850
lagging behind your
superhuman physical prowess,

25
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,060
when normally it would never lag.

26
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,070
It's a tricky move.

27
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:35,320
Your average sorcerer wouldn't know what
happened, and they'd be left disoriented.

28
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,150
It carries plenty of force, too.

29
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,780
For opponents on that level, at least!

30
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,330
But it won't work against special-grades.

31
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,330
What will you do, best friend?

32
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,000
Imbue my full strength with
cursed energy at the right moment.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,090
Good!

34
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,420
So then why is your cursed energy lagging?

35
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,890
It's because you're channeling it!

36
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:02,640
Huh?

37
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:07,100
Wait, I thought we were talking
about channeling it faster...

38
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,940
We channel cursed energy.

39
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,610
Many sorcerers do this consciously.

40
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,360
"My stomach's full of rage."

41
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,530
"The blood's boiling in my gut."

42
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,150
The theory is that cursed energy extracted

43
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,610
from such negative emotions

44
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,620
Curse

45
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,240
starts in the navel and is
channeled throughout the body.

46
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,120
They say it flows from the navel to the chest,

47
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,420
then the shoulders, arms,
and finally the fists,

48
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,130
but this perception of
the body as individual parts

49
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,630
is what delays cursed energy.

50
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,630
The idea of channeling cursed
energy isn't wrong in itself.

51
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,220
But that's only the first step!

52
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,050
You can't let yourself remain
too trapped by that concept.

53
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,140
The better the sorcerer, the harder it is
to read the flow of their cursed energy.

54
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,940
For a different reason from why yours is.

55
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,320
Do we think with our guts?

56
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,320
Do we express anger with our heads?

57
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,900
Listen to me, Itadori.

58
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:16,210
We exist in this world with our entire mind,
body, and soul as one whole.

59
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,720
It's such a given that
everyone forgets about it.

60
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,970
Thanks, Toudou.

61
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,480
I think I get it now.

62
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,440
Then no more words are needed.

63
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,030
I won't hold back.

64
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,530
I'll guide you with my full strength!

65
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,790
Don't die on me, Itadori!

66
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,960
Rise up to greater heights!

67
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,790
JUJUTSU KAISEN

68
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:31,510
Episode 16: Kyoto Sister School Exchange Event - Group Battle 2 -

69
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,590
Hey, you.

70
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:32,560
Your old fart told you to kill Itadori, right?

71
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,770
This girl has good intuition.

72
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,100
No, that was probably Panda-chan.

73
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,270
Huh? What do you mean?

74
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,570
You really don't need to hide it.

75
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,740
I'm out to kill someone, too.

76
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,200
Especially that bitch Mai,
the watered-down version of Maki.

77
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,450
What?

78
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,700
Don't "What?" me.

79
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,160
Even Pepper-kun gives slightly
better responses than that.

80
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,210
What, she's not getting mad?

81
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,210
But I feel the same way right now!

82
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:06,590
Oh, I almost forgot. You guys
have your own Pepper-kun, huh?

83
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,090
Maybe I'll scrap it and dump it somewhere.

84
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,850
Scary...

85
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,900
Panda-senpai!

86
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,820
It's a cursed corpse.

87
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,480
It won't die.

88
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,440
Though it won't be able to move for a while.

89
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,910
Now, who were you calling a Pepper-kun?

90
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,030
Hold on, Mechamaru.

91
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,290
I'll beat this first-year into cute shape.

92
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,380
I'll show her how Mai-chan's suffered

93
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,800
and teach her all about what it means
for a woman to live as a jujutsu sorcerer.

94
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,920
Just kidding.

95
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,880
Huh?

96
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,610
You looking for attention?

97
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,390
You should focus on support
and staying hidden.

98
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,770
Well, let's just get along,

99
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,690
since we're so similar.

100
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,320
Damn puppet...

101
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,990
What do you know?!

102
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,250
Good grief. What happened
to hunting cursed spirits?

103
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,000
Sword Option:

104
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,380
Boost On!

105
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,430
Ultra Spin!

106
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,940
Can't you keep still?

107
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,240
I need to finish this quickly.

108
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,200
I'd rather leave him be and go
help Nobara, but he fires at range.

109
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,080
We didn't have information on
Mechamaru, Nishimiya, or Miwa, but...

110
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,910
You're strong.

111
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,460
What grade are you?

112
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:09,940
Third-Grade

113
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:09,940
Semi-
Second-Grade

114
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:09,940
Second-Grade

115
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:09,940
Semi-
First-Grade

116
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:09,940
First-Grade

117
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,540
By my guess, this is where everyone stands.

118
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,940
It's a little too much
for Nobara to handle.

119
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,800
I don't think my rating against
cursed spirits is needed right now,

120
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,970
but I'll tell you.

121
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,720
Semi-first-grade.

122
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,220
Huh?

123
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,980
Ultra Cannon!

124
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,150
His area of attack is huge!

125
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,860
Heat emission!

126
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,950
It's a technique with big
build-up and cool-down.

127
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:42,120
This output is pointless if
I don't hit its core dead-on.

128
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,370
Cursed corpses.

129
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,500
That's the generic name
for inanimate objects

130
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,470
that house curses and can
operate independently.

131
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:56,340
Man-made cursed corpses always have
a core that serves as their heart.

132
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,520
Panda is the ultimate masterpiece
by myself, Yaga Masamichi,

133
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,480
the leading expert on
puppeteering cursed techniques.

134
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,150
He's a cursed corpse born with emotions...

135
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,200
A cursed corpse mutation!

136
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:28,210
Panda... is not a panda!

137
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,850
I can't follow his movements!

138
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:01,490
I guess if there was another like me,
I would have at least heard rumors.

139
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,490
The fact that I haven't

140
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,330
means you're not a cursed corpse.

141
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:09,250
You're a sorcerer who's remote-controlling
this thing while your main body's elsewhere.

142
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,000
That doesn't mean you should snap over
being treated like a cursed corpse.

143
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,710
You don't like being similar to me?

144
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,800
You wound me.

145
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,220
I think it actually hurts!

146
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:26,430
Judging from your cursed energy output,
your main body shouldn't be that far away.

147
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,440
No, you're just outside the arena, huh?

148
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:31,310
Guess there's no point in
hunting you down, then.

149
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,270
You'd just be free to act in the meantime.

150
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,440
So I guess I'll just bust you up.

151
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,950
You won't be doing either.

152
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,860
Heavenly pact.

153
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,820
Have you heard of it?

154
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:46,160
It's not like a pact normally
forged with oneself.

155
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,250
It's a pact forced upon the body
from the moment it's born.

156
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,170
I was born without a right arm
or anything below my knees,

157
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,840
and I had no sensation from the waist down.

158
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,130
My skin is so fragile that
even moonlight burns it,

159
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:04,100
and it constantly feels like needles
are stabbing every pore of my body.

160
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,430
But in exchange, I've been granted the ability

161
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,230
to use cursed techniques over vast distances,

162
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,350
as well as immense cursed energy production.

163
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,150
I didn't ask for any of this power.

164
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:19,110
If I could trade my cursed techniques
to have a normal body, I'd gladly do so.

165
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:22,410
So when I see a cursed corpse like you

166
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,870
walking around in broad daylight
without a care instead of me,

167
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,500
I just cannot stand it!

168
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,080
Ultimate Mechamaru,

169
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,500
Mode: Albatross!

170
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,010
That's an incredible
amount of cursed energy!

171
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:45,930
And given his position,
Nobara's in his line of fire!

172
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,140
I have to block it!

173
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,060
Ultimate Cannon!

174
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,120
It's dead?

175
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,750
No, the very concept of death

176
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,920
doesn't apply to you.

177
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,920
You revealed your technique

178
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,420
while boasting about your misfortune, then.

179
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,090
Quite the sorcerer thing to do.

180
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:27,180
It's still alive after taking a hit
from Ultimate Cannon?!

181
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,980
I'm kind of pissed now.

182
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:38,980
What is that form?

183
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,610
Panda... is not a panda!

184
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,990
JUJUTSU KAISEN

185
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,000
JUJUTSU KAISEN

186
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,590
Panda.

187
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:04,380
You have an older brother
and an older sister.

188
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,220
No, I do not.

189
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,680
Yes, you do.

190
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,680
They're inside you.

191
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,020
And why the polite tone?

192
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,730
Inside me?

193
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,400
Yes. You'll understand someday.

194
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,230
Those two will always,

195
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,150
always lend you strength.

196
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,530
Sword Option: Ultra Shield!

197
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:40,540
Normally, a cursed corpse has
a single core for its heart.

198
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,090
But there are three cores inside me,

199
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:47,010
and by switching out which one is
the main core, I can convert my body.

200
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:51,350
There's the Panda core, focused on balance...

201
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:55,520
my older brother, Gorilla Core,
focused on power for short, decisive battles...

202
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,770
and my bashful older sister.

203
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:01,360
His first attack got my older sister's core,

204
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,110
and that last one exhausted the Panda core.

205
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,740
I have no choice left but to
beat him with Gorilla Mode!

206
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,080
He doesn't pack as much power as Toudou.

207
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,670
But that palm strike just now

208
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,090
went all the way to my internals.

209
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,670
Even if I guard, I'll still take damage.

210
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,550
You realized it?

211
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,260
This is Gorilla Mode's special move,

212
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:36,100
the unstoppable Drumming Beat!

213
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:40,190
If I take that Drumming Beat
to my head or chest,

214
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,860
I won't be able to move Mechamaru anymore.

215
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:47,030
My right arm, Sword Option,
is no longer functioning.

216
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,610
I can't fire Ultimate Cannon anymore, either.

217
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:54,370
Gorilla Mode pounds through
cursed energy like a gorilla.

218
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,870
I need to hurry.

219
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,750
I crushed his right arm.

220
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,210
He can't fire off his
ultimate attack anymore.

221
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:03,170
No swords in his left or his mouth,
so only ranged blasts left?

222
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,210
Even so, he shouldn't fire them haphazardly.

223
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:10,630
Mechamaru believes he failed to finish
me with those blasts twice already,

224
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,640
despite actually putting two
of my cores close to death.

225
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,600
This time he'll likely blast my core
with point-blank precision

226
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,770
or try to finish me with a slash.

227
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,020
However...

228
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,450
I have the advantage at close range!

229
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,030
A tile?

230
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:55,490
Did he pick it off the roof just now?

231
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,750
A distraction, then jet acceleration!

232
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,380
He's experienced at this!

233
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,210
This time, I won't miss!

234
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,800
Its core is where its
cursed energy is densest!

235
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,880
Right here!

236
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:26,060
You did well, for a puppet.

237
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,780
Don't treat me like other cursed corpses.

238
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,110
I know how to bluff the position of my core
with cursed energy manipulation.

239
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,330
I'm already concealing the
number of cores, anyway.

240
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,800
You lost because you
underestimated puppets.

241
00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:00,850
I haven't had a single thing in common with
anyone around me from the moment I was born.

242
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:04,930
I thought you and I could
understand each other in that sense.

243
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,560
Though I've never once
been jealous of humans.

244
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,810
What?

245
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:13,320
I mean, humans are creepy, you know?

246
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,870
They'll risk their lives and fight
hard toward their goals,

247
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:23,830
then they'll be laid-back or
wishy-washy. I don't get it.

248
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:28,580
Still, I do love those aspects
that I don't have,

249
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,790
creepy as they are.

250
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,500
I'm sure you have your own
hardships, too, Mechamaru.

251
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,220
But having more hardships
doesn't make you right.

252
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,510
I mean, it's not like we're
enemies in the first place.

253
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,970
Why are you a jujutsu
sorcerer to begin with?

254
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,560
Because that's the only thing you can do?

255
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,770
I mean, not that it really matters.

256
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,270
But if you want to make something happen,

257
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,400
I'll help you.

258
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,280
Mechamaru.

259
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,160
Don't waste your powerful moves.

260
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,280
You never know when you'll be facing
more than the single enemy before you.

261
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,040
Mechamaru,

262
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,580
don't go thinking someone who can't
instantly state his type of woman

263
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,790
can become a full-fledged jujutsu sorcerer.

264
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:17,380
Mechamaru, it's just obligatory,
but I got you these instead of chocolates.

265
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,340
I heard you liked AA Evoltas.

266
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,800
I'm not like that.

267
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,930
Huh?

268
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,810
But Mai said—

269
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,310
One day...

270
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,950
together with everyone...

271
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,920
Hm? Say that again?

272
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:56,800
I wonder if you'll still say you'll
help me after seeing what I look like.

273
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,680
You think I'm going to
fuss over what you look like?

274
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,970
I'm a panda.

275
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,510
Later.

276
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,140
Let me pay you a visit next time.

277
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,730
Shut up, you damn puppet.

278
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,950
I forgot!

279
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,830
Lend me your phone.

280
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:32,500
Kyoto Sister School Exchange Event Group Battle
Ultimate Mechamaru - Retired

281
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,510
No way!

282
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,090
This woman... is incredibly strong!

283
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,520
Juju Stroll

284
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:24,570
Mechamaru, let Noritoshi know
Utahime-sensei's calling for him.

285
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:30,020
Mechamaru, give this to Toudou-kun.

286
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:33,060
Mechamaru! Perfect timing.

287
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,360
This is for Toudou-senpai and Kamo-senpai.

288
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,800
Why do you all always go through me?

289
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,800
Grk!

290
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:48,060
Don't talk to me right now.

291
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,800
Takada-chan's live-streaming.

292
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,790
Ibaragi?

293
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,980
It's Ibaraki.

294
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,030
You don't even know that?

295
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:03,760
Because they're too much trouble, obviously.

296
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,320
I'm honestly still scared of them...

297
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:17,580
But if I said that, I might not
be able to ask him anymore.

298
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,560
Mechamaru!

299
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,920
We're counting on you!

300
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,310
Time for our missions!

301
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,220
Wait...

302
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,860
Why?

303
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,780
Well, I guess it's good
that they can rely on me.

304
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:55,740
Episode 17:
Kyoto Sister School Exchange Event - Group Battle 3 -
