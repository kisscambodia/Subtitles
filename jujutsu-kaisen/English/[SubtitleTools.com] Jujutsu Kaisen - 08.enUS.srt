1
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,980
Tokyo Metropolitan
Jujutsu Technical High School

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,440
Cold

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,400
Couldn't they put in a few
more vending machines?

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,460
They can't. There are only so many
workers who can come in here.

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:20,670
Huh?

6
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:22,840
Where are the first-years?

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,550
On errands.

8
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,920
Bonito flakes.

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,610
Will they be okay?

10
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,290
Salmon.

11
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,660
They're not three years old.

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,310
They can handle an errand run.

13
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,390
No, that's not what I mean.

14
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,860
It's today, right?

15
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,810
The day Kyoto's principal comes.

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,600
To go over the exchange event.

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,480
Tuna.

18
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,560
Satoru's fighting with the higher-ups
because they arranged for

19
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,030
the first-years to get dispatched
on that special-grade case, right?

20
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,550
And the principal of Kyoto is
one of those higher-ups, isn't he?

21
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,800
So if they run into each other...

22
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,880
The first-year they were
targeting, Itadori, is dead.

23
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,460
I doubt he has any plans to do
anything about the other two.

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,290
Besides, the old man from Kyoto
won't cause a scene in broad daylight.

25
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:13,520
Salmon.

26
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,850
An instructor might have
his position to worry about,

27
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,960
but that's not the case for the students.

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,920
Are you saying Mai is coming?

29
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,900
It's just a guess.

30
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,490
Students aren't necessary for a meeting.

31
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,860
But still...

32
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,660
They love harassing us, right?

33
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,940
Both Toudou and Mai.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,710
What are you doing here, Zenin-senpai?

35
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,990
Oh, she's one, too?

36
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,160
They do seem similar. Are they sisters?

37
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,590
They're twins.

38
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,000
Don't call me that, Fushiguro-kun.

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,720
You make me sound the same as Maki.

40
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,590
Call me Mai.

41
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,220
So these are the pinch hitters
for Okkotsu and the third-years?

42
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,890
We came here with the principal
because we were worried about you.

43
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,320
Your classmate died, right?

44
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,570
Was that rough?

45
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,720
Or did you think nothing of it?

46
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,620
What are you trying to say?

47
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,650
It's okay.

48
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,810
Some things are hard to say out loud.

49
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,790
So I'll say it for you.

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,480
"Vessel" makes it sound nice,

51
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,200
but it just means he was a half-curse monster.

52
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,240
Having such a tainted,
inhuman being beside you

53
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:30,000
brazenly calling himself a jujutsu
sorcerer must have been revolting, right?

54
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,190
Aren't you feeling better
now that he's dead?

55
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,630
Mai, don't bring up such pointless topics.

56
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,600
I'm only here to see if these guys
are fit to take Okkotsu's place.

57
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,620
That's all I want to know.

58
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,490
Fushiguro, was it?

59
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,610
What kind of woman is your type?

60
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,960
Depending on your answer,

61
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,570
I'll beat you half to death right here

62
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:09,040
and drag Okkotsu, or at least the
third-years, out to the exchange event.

63
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:17,680
By the way, my type is a
tall woman with a big ass!

64
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:35,980
Jujutsu Kaisen

65
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:58,860
Episode 8:  Boredom

66
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,790
Why do I have to talk about

67
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,570
my taste in women with a guy I just met?

68
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,720
He's right. That's a tall hurdle
for an antisocial guy.

69
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,610
You be quiet.

70
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,980
This is confusing enough already.
You'll just make it more complicated.

71
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,240
Kyoto, third-year, Toudou Aoi.

72
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,260
Introduction over.

73
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,560
Now we're friends.

74
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,010
Hurry up and answer.
If you prefer men, that's fine, too.

75
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,810
A person's fetishes reflect
everything about them.

76
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,820
People with boring taste in women
are boring people themselves.

77
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,580
And I hate boring men.

78
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,550
The exchange event is where my soul can
be free as blood boils and flesh clashes.

79
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:43,380
Who knows what I might do if my
last exchange event ends up boring me?

80
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,490
Hey, aren't the Jujutsu Tech
schools four-year schools?

81
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,090
Only third-years and under
can join the exchange event.

82
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,270
Huh...

83
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,880
As a show of kindness, I'll let you
off only half-dead right now.

84
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,340
Answer me, Fushiguro.

85
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,350
What kind of woman is your type?

86
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,120
Is this some kind of comedy routine?

87
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,740
Is that your summer uniform?

88
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,690
Ticks me off, but it's nice.

89
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,690
Kugisaki's unarmed.
I'd rather avoid confrontation.

90
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,530
Not forgiving people isn't a bad thing.

91
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,200
That's just part of your kindness, isn't it?

92
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,530
I don't have a particular preference.

93
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:28,060
As long as she has unshakable
character, I won't ask for more.

94
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,480
Not a bad answer.

95
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,410
If you had said something like
"big boobs," I'd have killed you.

96
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,010
Shut up.

97
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,420
I knew it.

98
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,840
You're boring, Fushiguro.

99
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,350
Fushiguro!

100
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,880
Poor Fushiguro-kun.

101
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,960
Even a talented
second-grade jujutsu sorcerer

102
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,270
is nothing more than a first-year
against the top-grade Toudou-senpai.

103
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,440
I'll have to comfort him later.

104
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,040
I thought you two were similar,
but that's not the case at all.

105
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,350
Maki-san's a hundred times prettier.

106
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,300
Are you not sleeping enough?
You've got open pores.

107
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,970
I'll teach you...

108
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,650
how to speak to others.

109
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,100
I knew at first glance

110
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,970
that you were a boring guy.

111
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,020
But you shouldn't judge a
person by their looks, right?

112
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:46,250
So I went out of my way to ask you,

113
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,090
but you just trampled on my kindness.

114
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,950
Is your brain as pineapple as your head?

115
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,720
Toudou... That Toudou?

116
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,160
The one involved in last year's

117
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,200
unprecedented jujutsu terror attack
caused by the curse user, Getou—

118
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,960
Kabuki-cho First Street

119
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,610
The Night Parade of a Hundred Demons
from Kyoto to Shinjuku.

120
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,680
The one who exorcised a special-grade and five first-grade cursed spirits

121
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,770
by himself when the parade appeared in Kyoto?

122
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,960
That Toudou?

123
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,890
Still, there are several first-grade
sorcerers capable of beating a special-grade.

124
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,810
What's shocking is...

125
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,120
I heard you don't use cursed techniques.

126
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,730
Huh? Oh, that rumor's false.

127
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,260
I used them against the special-grade.

128
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,480
He doesn't use them against first-grades?!

129
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,550
Is he a monster?!

130
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,620
That's a relief to hear.

131
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,750
Nue, plus Gama!

132
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,280
Bottomless Well.

133
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,800
I'm up against a hardcore
close-range fighter.

134
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,650
I'll keep my distance and restrain him.

135
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,520
He's fast!

136
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,310
That wasn't his full speed earlier?!

137
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,810
Flimsy and shallow...

138
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,740
Both your body

139
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,590
and your taste in women!

140
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,470
Damn it!

141
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,290
His power is insane!

142
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,480
I'm not finished yet!

143
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,820
You're always

144
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,020
so boring!

145
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,750
I barely feel any intention to fight.

146
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,190
I've been holding back, and you're so proud?

147
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,040
If you're going to insist like that...

148
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,730
then I'll show you.

149
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,000
Bring it!

150
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,480
Don't move.

151
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:32,880
What are you two doing?!

152
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:38,010
Whew, just barely safe.

153
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,760
Bonito flakes.

154
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,910
Okay, I guess that might actually be an out.

155
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,670
Long time no see, Panda.

156
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,990
Why can't you just wait
until the exchange event?

157
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:56,480
Go on home, or I'll start screaming, "No!"

158
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,670
You don't have to tell me to go home.

159
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,950
Where'd I put my jacket?

160
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,890
Looks like I won't be bored the whole time.

161
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,310
Give Okkotsu a message for me:
"You take part, too."

162
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,200
What a pain.

163
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,260
I panda. I no understand human speech.

164
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,560
Salmon.

165
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,790
If you want to continue as a jujutsu sorcerer,
learn to choose who you pick a fight with.

166
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,320
What are you doing to our errand runner, Mai?

167
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,920
Oh, my. You're such a loser,
I didn't even notice you, Maki.

168
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,720
We're both equally losers, you know.

169
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,800
All you can do is imbue objects
with cursed energy,

170
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,950
and you've got shit for cursed techniques.

171
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,060
Better than having no cursed energy at all.

172
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,760
My neck gets sore looking up
at others all the time,

173
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,020
so I need to look down on someone
like you every so often.

174
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,240
Ah, forget it. We're both at
rock bottom, and it's pathetic.

175
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,620
Nobara, can you stand?

176
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,880
No way.

177
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,770
She won't be getting up for a while.

178
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,530
I hurt her pretty good...

179
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:12,170
What? You want to fight?

180
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,020
Nice support, Maki-san!

181
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,420
You put a bunch of holes
in my brand new tracksuit.

182
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:26,420
Leave that uniform of yours behind.
I'll make it my own summer uniform!

183
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,990
I'll put holes in your body next time.

184
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:34,250
Also, you wouldn't be able to wear
this with those long legs of yours—

185
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,110
Leave it!

186
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,370
We're leaving, Mai.

187
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:44,460
What?! No way...

188
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,230
Oh, there's my jacket.

189
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,300
Where's Fushiguro?

190
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,130
Don't worry. The others are with him.

191
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,420
Looks like you're having fun.

192
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,640
Quit joking! I'm just getting started!

193
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,640
No, you're not.

194
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,380
Unlike you, I still have
important business here in Tokyo.

195
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,900
My personal handshake with Takada-chan!

196
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,800
Takada-chan

197
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,800
8th single "Youth Mineral" Release Celebration

198
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,800
5 min

199
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,850
Tall Idol Takada-chan

200
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,860
Uh-huh...

201
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:21,220
Who knows what I might do if I miss my
transfer and can't make it to the event hall?

202
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,260
Come with me, Mai.

203
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,800
Ugh! You're so selfish!

204
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,970
Can't believe I lost the lottery
for the usual one in Kyoto.

205
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,960
Don't go thinking you'll get off
this easy at the exchange event.

206
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,350
Quit acting like you won!

207
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,560
Leave your uniform behind, damn it!

208
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,170
Cut it out, idiot.

209
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,920
Winning or losing here hardly matters.

210
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,960
We'll beat them up at the exchange event.

211
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,930
Hey, Maki-san...

212
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,320
Is what she said true?
That you don't have cursed energy?

213
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,160
It's true.

214
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:58,860
So I can't even see curses
without these glasses.

215
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,730
That's why I use cursed tools.

216
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,940
They already have curses imbued in them.

217
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,690
I can't pour my own cursed energy
into them to do things like you all do.

218
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,690
Like that thing he gave Itadori?

219
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,690
Then why are you a jujutsu sorcerer?

220
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,560
To spite them.

221
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,500
I can't wait to see the looks on my family's faces when I become a bigshot sorcerer,

222
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,430
after all the years they've
spent looking down on me.

223
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,930
Come on, let's hurry over to see Shouko-san.

224
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,240
I respect you, Maki-san.

225
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,690
That so?

226
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,980
Jujutsu Kaisen

227
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,990
Jujutsu Kaisen

228
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,170
Is Yaga here yet?

229
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:11,680
The time of an old man close
to death doesn't come cheap.

230
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,920
Principal Yaga won't be coming for a while.

231
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,580
Oh?

232
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,560
He was given a false schedule.

233
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,630
After some threats to Ijichi.

234
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:32,940
Thank you for the other day,
Principal Gakuganji.

235
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,140
Oh? What other day would that be?

236
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,080
Don't play dumb with me, old man.

237
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,240
I'm referring to the case with Itadori Yuuji.

238
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:43,450
As head of the conservatives,
you were involved too, correct?

239
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:49,520
My goodness, youth these days...

240
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,710
Don't you know how to be polite?

241
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,770
I never had any intention of respecting you.

242
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:58,430
Elders these days love to act important,
and it's so annoying, honestly.

243
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,590
Hey.

244
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,600
Your conduct is problematic.

245
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,870
I'll be reporting you to
the relevant authorities.

246
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,170
Oh, man!

247
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:11,120
It's Gojou Satoru in person!
Gojou Satoru in person!

248
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,500
Feel free.

249
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:15,010
I don't plan to chat for long.

250
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,880
He spoke! He spoke to me!

251
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:26,240
Last night, I was attacked by two
unregistered special-grade cursed spirits.

252
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,570
Oh? That is unfortunate.

253
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,770
Don't get me wrong here.

254
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,780
To me, it was about like being coerced
into taking a survey in the city.

255
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,030
So cool!

256
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,630
The two cursed spirits were
capable of communication,

257
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,280
and they probably have
allies who are just as strong.

258
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,810
It's not just our enemies, either.

259
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,690
Hakari, Okkotsu, and your Toudou...

260
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,710
The level of our students has risen
drastically in recent years, as well.

261
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,610
Then there was last year's
incident with Getou Suguru...

262
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,600
And now, the appearance of Sukuna's vessel.

263
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,440
What are you trying to say?

264
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,340
You don't know?

265
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,890
The wave of power you guys
have been trying to hold back

266
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,060
with your pointless status and traditions

267
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,360
has grown bigger than you can handle
and is now descending upon us.

268
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,730
You won't be able to measure

269
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,320
the coming age with the
classification of "special-grade."

270
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,920
If you think I'm the only
one who'll be fighting back,

271
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,560
you're going to get hurt, old man.

272
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:39,830
I think you are getting a bit out of line.

273
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,830
Oh, scary!

274
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,320
Well, that's all I wanted to say.
I'll be going now.

275
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,350
Oh, Principal Yaga will be
coming in about two hours.

276
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,710
Later!

277
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,330
Two hours?!

278
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,170
Miwa, would you go buy me some tea?

279
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:04,730
Yes, sir.

280
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,840
Excuse me.

281
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:18,320
If I can catch up to him, I'll get
him to take a picture with me!

Okay, here I go!

00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,120

three high school boys'

296
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,380
disfigured corpses were discovered by staff

297
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:20,050
Cause of death: increased cranial pressure and

298
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,050
respiratory paralysis due to cranial deformity

299
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,220
Excuse me...

300
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,370
Did you do that?

301
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,160
In the theater?

302
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:48,660
Wow. You can see me?

303
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:04,180
It's a gruesome sight.

304
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,780
Are you ready to witness it, Itadori-kun?

305
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,960
Thank you so much!

306
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,660
You're welcome.

307
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,420
I got a photo!

Don't get turned on.

315
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,330
Mai, sorry to keep you waiting.

316
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,080
What's wrong?

317
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,940
Did something unpleasant happen?

318
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,030
Why don't you ask yourself that?

319
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,320

What's this?

325
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,560
For the next handshake event.

326
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,920
You should go experience how
wonderful Takada-chan is in person.

327
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,840
It's just plain annoying.

328
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,760
This is my duty as a fan...
As a future husband.

329
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,520
That's just plain creepy.

330
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,820
But if I reject his offer,
he'll get even more annoying.

331
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,930
What's the matter?

332
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,440
Yeah, sure.

333
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,640
Huh?!

334
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,040
Wow, a girl!

335
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,880
It's your first time, right?

336
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,950
Yeah.

337
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,830
What's your name?

338
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,760
Mai.

339
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,850
Mai-chan, are you tired?

340
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,620
Did you wait long?

341
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:20,220
It was more the people than the line...

342
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:23,490
Then come back again
when you're feeling better.

343
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:26,470
I'll remember you, Mai-chan.

344
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,770
You're back, Mai?

345
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,410
How was it?

346
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,970
Fine.

347
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,840
True, Takada-chan isn't a woman
that can so easily be put into words.

348
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,320
She's not bad...

349
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:54,990
