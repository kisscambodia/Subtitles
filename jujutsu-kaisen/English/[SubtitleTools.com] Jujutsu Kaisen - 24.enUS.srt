1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,060
Kugisaki! Don't let that blood touch you!

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,980
You think I don't know that?!

3
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,490
Run away,

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,750
with your backs to me.

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,810
Kugisaki, can you go any faster?

6
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:26,960
No way!

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,520
I've got your back.

8
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,310
Thanks.

9
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,150
Huh?

10
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,390
Huh?!

11
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,720
What speed...

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,400
While carrying someone, too.

13
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,170
Tsk... They'll get away.

14
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,400
Well, no matter.

15
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,090
Okay, we're out of range now.

16
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,940
Well done. You have my compliments.

17
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,090
Yeah, yeah.

18
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,090
I'm kidding. Thank you.

19
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,940
It took the shortest route
and got ahead of us?

20
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,170
Itado—

21
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,440
Kugisaki!

22
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,460
You don't need to worry.

23
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:47,400
My younger brother's blood doesn't
have the same quality as mine.

24
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:53,840
And even mine won't kill you
unless your entire body's bathed in it.

25
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,590
Though it will hurt like hell.

26
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,390
This is where our technique starts.

27
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,100
Rot Technique: Decay.

28
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,420
Huh?

29
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,830
JUJUTSU KAISEN

30
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,950
My blood, and my brothers' blood,

31
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:51,000
Episode 24: Accomplices

32
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,260
is absorbed through wounds and membranes,

33
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,950
and then, once any of us
brothers activates the technique,

34
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:58,000
it begins to rot you away
from the point of incursion.

35
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,260
I'd give that young man
about fifteen minutes.

36
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,510
Ten minutes max for you, young lady.

37
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,300
By morning, nothing but bones will remain.

38
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,020
If it's a technique,

39
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,180
we just need to make them release it!

40
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,180
So it is poisonous.

41
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,140
The result is essentially a poison,

42
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,190
but our technique is purely "decomposition."

43
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,150
I've finished revealing our technique.

44
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,700
Now they'll actually die even faster.

45
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,200
So, what will you do now?

46
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,430
Elder Brother, these sorcerers
didn't amount to much.

47
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,180
At the beginning of the Meiji Era,

48
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,630
there was a girl with a unique trait that
allowed her to bear a cursed spirit's child.

49
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,950
She conceived a child
with no recollection of how,

50
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,900
and the criticism she endured from
her parents and relatives was extreme.

51
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,220
She fled with the corpse
of her baby in her arms,

52
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,610
ending up at a temple run
by a certain jujutsu sorcerer.

53
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:56,730
However, that was where her luck ran out.

54
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,010
Kamo Noritoshi.

55
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,930
Among all of jujutsu
sorcery's cultural legacy,

56
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,520
he's remembered as
the most vile of sorcerers

57
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,330
and a disgrace to the three major clans.

58
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,240
His intellectual curiosity

59
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,580
was captivated by the possibility of a
child born of a human and a cursed spirit.

60
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,630
Nine times, he impregnated her.

61
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,030
Nine times, he aborted her.

62
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,110
All records of how he did it

63
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:20,860
and what happened to her
afterward were destroyed.

64
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,830
The Cursed Wombs:
Death Paintings One through Three

65
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,520
became cursed objects powerful enough
to be classified as special-grade.

66
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,380
Perhaps the origin of that power
was the mother's resentment,

67
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,260
or perhaps...

68
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,760
I have no memories of a mother.

69
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,770
Humans and sorcerers...

70
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,390
It's not that I hold any
special grudge against them.

71
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,450
For 150 years,

72
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:48,160
we remained sealed away with nothing
but each others' existence to rely on.

73
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,400
We'll side with the cursed spirits.

74
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,440
Are you sure?

75
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,920
They seemed shady, Elder Brother.

76
00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:00,420
The future those cursed spirits painted
is more convenient for us.

77
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,100
That's all there is to it.

78
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,080
Forget about owing them
for our manifestation.

79
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,420
Now listen, brothers.

80
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,920
Eso, you live for Kechizu.

81
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,430
Kechizu, you live for me.

82
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,930
And I'll live for you, Eso.

83
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:19,440
We three are one.

84
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,430
I live for my brothers.

85
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,540
If it is what my brothers desire,

86
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,190
I will give my life to grant it for them.

87
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,270
If the suffering is too great,

88
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:31,400
would you like me to end you right away?

89
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,630
A technique that guarantees
victory once it hits...

90
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,200
You two are strong.

91
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,960
Too bad for you, though.

92
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,560
That makes me the worst match for you!

93
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,460
Straw Doll Technique: Resonance!

94
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,430
Let's play a game of chicken!

95
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,920
You don't like pain, do you?

96
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,930
Then start crying and
release your technique.

97
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,310
A technique to turn the curse on the user?

98
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,440
A game of chicken...

99
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,440
So unless I release our technique,
this will continue?

100
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,240
Straw Doll Technique: Resonance.

101
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:17,680
It's a technique that deals damage
to the target's main body

102
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,330
by driving cursed energy through an effigy
and a lost portion of the target.

103
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,320
The technique's range is broad,

104
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,090
and the effect varies

105
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,050
with the difference in strength between
us and the value of the lost portion.

106
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,050
As far as Straw Doll Technique is concerned,

107
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,000
blood isn't very valuable.

108
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,360
But Resonance uses the link to its target.

109
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,110
And their blood that's inside me now

110
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,060
is strongly linking us and
their rot technique together!

111
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,910
It's a nice surprise that it worked
on the younger brother, too.

112
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,030
If I'm going to die here anyway,

113
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,000
then I'll keep hammering
Resonance into them!

114
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,650
That's quite intense,

115
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:03,250
but no matter how many times she
does it, it won't end our lives.

116
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,010
As long as we hold out,
you'll be the ones to die!

117
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,510
Not to mention,

118
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:12,460
while Decay is active, the pain
and poison will keep you from mov—

119
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,650
How are you able to move that well?

120
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,890
Resonance!

121
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,930
Itadori is the vessel

122
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,770
for Ryomen Sukuna,
the King of Curses and Deadly Poisons.

123
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:37,330
So he has resistance to all forms of poison.

124
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,400
The result is essentially a poison,

125
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,760
but our technique is purely "decomposition."

126
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,250
He's probably feeling pain
from the decomposition,

127
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,880
but the resulting poison doesn't affect him.

128
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,330
And if it's just pain...

129
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,090
Itadori Yuji...

130
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,150
won't stop!

131
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,730
Kechizu!

132
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,730
Shut up already!

133
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:12,980
Resonance!

134
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,320
That's nothing!

135
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,760
He switched!

136
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,350
With the woman close to death,

137
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,410
putting her against my brother,
who's closer to death!

138
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,370
Does she think she can stop
my movement forever?!

139
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,180
Woman!

140
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,440
Do I release the technique or not?

141
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,860
I can't go and save my brother like this!

142
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,970
I can't unleash Wing King
while Decay is active.

143
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:41,820
But does that woman have enough
strength left to kill my brother?

144
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,830
Even with her interference,

145
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:49,410
this man won't be able
to kill me before she dies,

146
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,980
so I cannot release the technique!

147
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,900
B-Brother!

148
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,400
We three are one.

149
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,290
I was already releasing it before I even knew it.

150
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,550
Wing King!

151
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,180
What was that black light just now?

152
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:10,480
I know I reinforced my arm with
cursed energy before taking his punch!

153
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,770
But the next thing I knew, my whole arm
and shoulder had been blown away.

154
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,030
Ahh, younger brother!

155
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,530
Don't die, my brother!

156
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,950
Elder Brother!

157
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,960
I haven't shown you this one yet, have I?

158
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,370
Hairpin.

159
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,220
Don't worry.

160
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,120
I'll be sending your older
brother to join you soon.

161
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,230
Kechizu...

162
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,270
We three are one.

163
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,310
I'm sorry, Elder Brother.

164
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,360
Even though I was with him...

165
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,960
Why isn't this thing vanishing?

166
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,030
Is it still alive?

167
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,530
No!

168
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,180
It's not a cursed spirit!

169
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,540
It has a physical body!

170
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,330
Watch it!

171
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,090
Christ.

172
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,360
S-Sawamura-san?!

173
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,800
Speed up.

174
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,830
Hit the brakes and you're dead.

175
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,190
Both you and him.

176
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,260
Got it?

177
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,280
Don't follow me, jujutsu sorcerer.

178
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,990
Once I heal my wounds,

179
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:46,740
I'll make sure to kill these two,
especially that woman.

180
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,690
I'm sorry, Kechizu...

181
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,240
I wasn't able to mourn you.

182
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:53,420
But I will get revenge for—

183
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,080
What is that woman doing?

184
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,660
Kugisaki!

185
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:04,430
Don't rush me!

186
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,010
Straw Doll Technique:

187
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,790
Resonance!

188
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,560
Once they land a Black Flash,

189
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,570
sorcerers temporarily enter
a state athletes call "the zone."

190
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,010
Damn it!

191
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:35,080
It wasn't a technique to
turn the curse on the user?!

192
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,760
Sorry.

193
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,600
That hurt.

194
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,070
Geto, the stock certificate.

195
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,330
What's the matter, Choso?

196
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,320
Hurry up.

197
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,840
Hey! Don't break the pieces!

198
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,060
My younger brothers died.

199
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,210
You can tell?

200
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,300
What's going on?

201
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,250
It's one thing if he was fully manifested,

202
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,170
but I find it hard to believe those two were
killed by a single finger of a cursed spirit.

203
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,170
Jeez, do we have any more?

204
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,040
Hold on.

205
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,730
Why aren't there spares?

206
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,140
And why did you break it?

207
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,960
We just received a report.

208
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,410
Eso and Kechizu were killed

209
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,860
Jeez.

210
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,310
by the first-years of Jujutsu High...

211
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,560
Itadori Yuji and his group.

212
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:57,530
The number you have dialed is—

213
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,530
I knew it! They're not answering!

214
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,490
Where did those brats go?!

215
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,500
Kugisaki, you okay?

216
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,860
Oh, yeah.

217
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,290
Though it might leave scars.

218
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:13,410
I wonder if those old guys are all right.
Their truck's gone, too.

219
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,140
The poison's...

220
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,680
Well, if we head home now,
I wonder if Shoko-san'll be awake.

221
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,210
And I wonder if she'll be sober...

222
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,520
What are you fidgeting for? It's creepy.

223
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,370
I was wondering if this was your first time

224
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,250
killing instead of exorcising.

225
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,030
What about you?

226
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,860
I did it once before...

227
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,000
No, I guess it isn't fair to call it once.

228
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,360
It was three people.

229
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,460
I think you're doing worse than me here.

230
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,110
To be blunt, this was nothing to me.

231
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,570
These things happen when you're a sorcerer.

232
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,650
I'm no Fushiguro,

233
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,880
but ultimately, there are only
so many people we can save.

234
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:57,060
There are only so many seats open in my life,

235
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:02,060
and I don't want to let my heart be swayed
by anyone who's not sitting in one of them.

236
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,880
Is that mean?

237
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:09,490
Of course, there are also people like you
who bring their own seat and sit down.

238
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,060
It might not mean much,

239
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:16,640
but we didn't have room to worry about
whether they were cursed spirits or curse users.

240
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,270
Even if they were human,

241
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,500
we don't have a technique to keep anyone
that strong restrained long-term.

242
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,360
You know that, right?

243
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,080
But he cried when he saw
his brother die before him.

244
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,350
I see.

245
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,780
I'm happy that you and I
were spared and are still alive.

246
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,890
It's a big relief.

247
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,790
But tears were shed over
the lives I ended tonight.

248
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,870
That's all.

249
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,020
I see.

250
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,800
In that case, we're accomplices.

251
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,360
F-Fushiguro?!

252
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,250
Oh, you're back.

253
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,370
I'm glad you're safe.

254
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,490
I-I was so scared!

255
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,990
I thought you were dead!

256
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,880
Thank goodness!

257
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,640
Could you lower your voices?

258
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,880
My head hurts.

259
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,890
Don't go to sleep with Sukuna's finger
in your hand. That's dangerous.

260
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,730
How do you know about the finger?

261
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,910
You have the energy to ask about that?

262
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,050
Nope.

263
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,150
Just contact Nitta-san for now.

264
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,670
We need to get it sealed at once.

265
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,890
Cursed spirits are approaching.

266
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,940
Should I eat it?

267
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,800
It's not leftovers.

268
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,740
We don't have a clear idea of
how many fingers you can handle.

269
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,400
So don't eat it.

270
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,410
But I will hand it over to you,
since you have the most energy.

271
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,910
I'll say this again, though. Don't eat it.

272
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,410
He thinks I have the intelligence of a dog.

273
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,480
We just said not to eat it!

274
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,840
Huh? Me?!

275
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,840
This guy seriously...

276
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,840
He hardly did any work this time, either!

277
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:06,470
The Sukuna within you will tell us where
the fingers are to try to regain his power.

278
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,840
Is Gojo-sensei just winging it?

279
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,160
You just now realized?

280
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,980
Hey! You three!

281
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,060
What have you three been doing?!

282
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,940
Oh, Nitta-san.

283
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,790
You wouldn't answer my calls!

284
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,800
She's lost it.

285
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,430
What's the big idea?!

286
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:23,010
Well, shall we go home?

287
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,560
Didn't you learn that communication,
consulting, and reporting are important?!

288
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,650
I'm hungry.

289
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:30,370
Are you listening to me?! Hey, you!

290
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,960
I wonder if there's a
Splendid Sushi around here.

291
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,330
Splendid Sushi's bullet train
was awesome, wasn't it?

292
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,250
Shut up.

293
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,980
Man, it wasn't just a cursed spirit with a finger.

294
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,920
When we analyzed the
corpses, what a surprise!

295
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:41,260
It was the manifestation of the other goods.

296
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,090
They each took out one special-grade!

297
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,290
This year's first-years
are the cream of the crop!

298
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:50,270
It must be my skill as an instructor.

299
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:54,620
I don't want any long chats
with you on my day off.

300
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,650
You're calling about arrangements
for the drinking party, right?

301
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,270
Well, find any candidates?

302
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,820
None.

303
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,030
Everyone's busy, even myself.

304
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,650
What now? Should I try
asking the students, too?

305
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:08,290
I'm a lightweight, so I don't mind
if the party's alcohol-free.

306
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:11,140
I'm counting on you to
keep reaching out to people.

307
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:12,750
Iori Utahime

308
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:19,700
We never know what might be
listening around Utahime, after all.

309
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,320
I don't want to think about one
of the students being the traitor.

310
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,220
This is such a pain.

311
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,850
Payment for: Gojo Satoru

312
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,850
Enter password to verify

313
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,850
Password

314
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,850
Confirm Payment

315
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:30,220
Well, I'll leave the rest to you, Mei-san.

316
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,230
Payment Complete

317
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,230
The payment has been sent.

318
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,190
Gojo Satoru

319
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,190
Don't talk about them
resonating with Itadori.

320
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,900
Are you certain about that?

321
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,210
Nearly positive. The case is over, though.

322
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,200
The only ones likely to notice

323
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,730
are us and Nitta-san.

324
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,110
Itadori...

325
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,700
and Sukuna's manifestation
was only the trigger.

326
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,050
The curse of Yasohachi Bridge could
have started killing at any moment.

327
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:06,220
Besides, he swallowed that
first finger to save me.

328
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,720
But there's no way he'd be
satisfied with just that.

329
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,720
So don't tell him.

330
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,830
I won't say anything.

331
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,720
Don't underestimate a lady's consideration.

332
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,730
It's your fault!

333
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,130
You took me in.

334
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:23,920
And now the severed parts
of my soul have awakened.

335
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,760
To save lots of people, was it?

336
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,100
Brat!

337
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,900
People are going to die because you live!

338
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,490
Hey... Don't say that to Fushiguro.

339
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:39,290
But what are you going to do when someone
you saved kills someone else in the future?

340
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,800
Don't you dare say it.

341
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:55,890
Mustard leaf.

342
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,150
What's wrong? Your movements
aren't as sharp today.

343
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,150
Did you get weaker?

344
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,810
Shut up!

345
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,160
I lost my edge after all that bed rest!

346
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:08,430
Anyway, did you hear about the first-years?

347
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,150
Yeah.

348
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,670
They took out three special-grades, right?

349
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:13,910
Salmon.

350
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,870
Then...

351
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,540
We can't fall behind, either.

352
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,550
Roe.

353
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,120
Yeah!

354
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,730
Hey! You were serious that time!

355
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,230
It wouldn't be good training
if I wasn't serious.

356
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:31,980
Kelp.

357
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,790
Even among sorcerers,

358
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:38,490
the rank of special-grade is a
position beyond the normal scope.

359
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,760
It's my belief that first-grades

360
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,510
are the ones who ought to lead other
sorcerers and the jujutsu world.

361
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:50,850
The danger, confidential information, and pay

362
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,490
that they deal with is nothing like
what those semi-first-grade and below do.

363
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,510
So with that in mind,
what did you just say?

364
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,180
Zen'in Maki,

365
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,010
Panda...

366
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,610
Fushiguro Megumi,

367
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,990
Kugisaki Nobara,

368
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:06,160
and my brother, Itadori Yuji.

369
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,510
These are the five that I,
by my name as Todo Aoi...

370
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,020
...and I, by my name as Mei Mei...

371
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,930
...recommend for first grade.

372
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:24,090
I think you're just buying way too much.

373
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:25,980
Half of that is yours, right?

374
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,070
Only this one is mine!

375
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:36,540
Drop even one... and you're dead!

376
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,290
R-Right...

377
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:49,350
I just said you're dead
if you drop even one!

378
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,770
I'm sorry! It wasn't on purpose!

379
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,910
You just have too many!

380
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:57,480
What are you going to do
if they're damaged?!

381
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,220
This is Fushiguro.

382
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,240
Yes.

383
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,150
Just go back and get another!

384
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,360
Yeah.

385
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,980
All right. See you.

386
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,320
What?

387
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,280
Gojo-sensei said to come.

388
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,090
Huh? Why?

389
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,970
A mission.

390
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,500
A top secret one.

391
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,610
What?

392
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,030
Didn't we just finish taking care of one?

393
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,080
Why not?

394
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:20,000
Gojo-sensei's saying it's top secret.

395
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,950
So it must be big.

396
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,960
He says that pretty often.

397
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:25,960
He says it all the time.

398
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,860
Yeah, but so what?

399
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:31,920
Let's go.

400
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,930
JUJUTSU KAISEN

401
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:39,930
To Be Continued
