1
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:05,940
Vengeance...

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:07,680
Dammit!

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,910
It was Scar!

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,900
He knew that Marcoh was involved in the extermination?!

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,880
Can't focus. My body is still puzzled about what to do.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,880
Shuuchuu dekitenaina mada karada ga mayotteirunda

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,640
I'm trembling. I can't stop even if I try to control myself.

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,640
Furueteitanja kontoroorushitatte burerunda

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,390
Although neither sun nor moon are on my side,

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,390
Taiyou mo tsuki mo nanmo kanzen ni kocchi muiteinaiga

11
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,810
"I've no choice but to try,"

12
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,810
Yarushikanainda

13
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,480
Iikikaseruyouni sotto tsubuyaita

14
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,480
Those were the words I muttered to myself.

15
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:44,070
The odds aren't on my side, but running way'd be gutless.

16
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:44,070
Joukyou wa waruiga tada nigedasunja konjou nainaa

17
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:48,070
Even if I can't see the future, I'll just have to win it over with courage.

18
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:48,070
Tenbou wa naiga dokyou de kuria suru shika naiya

19
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,570
Need to keep distance from the target as I hold myself back.

20
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,570
Shoudou wa osaetamama taagetto to no kankaku sagure

21
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,870
All that's needed for victory is pride to win.

22
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,870
Hitsuyou na mon wa katsu puraido

23
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,960
Will we celebrate with the wine of victory

24
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,960
Ajiwau nowa shouri no bishu ka

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,960
Or'll we end up kissing their feet in defeat?

26
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,960
Soretomo haiboku no kujuu ka

27
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,710
There are two outcomes to everything.

28
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,710
Sou subete wa futatsu ni hitotsu

29
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:09,430
I want to control destiny.

30
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:09,430
Ayatsuritai unmei no ito

31
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,760
I need to seize the golden opportunity with my hands.

32
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,760
Zekkou no goorudentaimu kono te de tsukame

33
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,850
I'll finish it up with my best poker face,

34
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,850
Konshin no pookaafeisu kimete shikakeruyo

35
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:23,810
And drag them into a world of illusions.

36
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:23,810
Iryuujon no sekai e hikizurikonde

37
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,150
I'll find my way out of this endless pressure game,

38
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,150
Saigennai puresshaageemu sururito nukete

39
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,160
Eikou no boodaarain tobikoeru tameni

40
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,160
And leap over the borderline of honor.

41
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,870
How many? What'll I need to sacrifice to make it happen?

42
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,870
Haumenii? Dorekurai no daishou ga iru?

43
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:43,130
What is the one thing I don't want to let go?

44
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:43,130
Tebanashitakunai mon wa dore?

45
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,530
I'll let you know when I get more information.

46
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,410
Isn't being an assistant to the Führer President the same thing as being taken hostage?

47
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,830
You sure you'll be okay?

48
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:00,800
To look at it in a positive light, it means I have the chance to assassinate him in his sleep.

49
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,670
That's scary.

50
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,220
Oh, right.

51
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:09,300
Do me a favor and let the Colonel know that Scar is still lurking around.

52
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,310
Got it.

53
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,230
Lieutenant.

54
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:16,980
Yes?

55
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,320
Thanks for telling me about Ishbal.

56
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,720
The 520 Cens Promise

57
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,660
Al!

58
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,370
Brother! What's up?

59
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,670
Wow... So that's how things were in Ishbal...

60
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,010
She was willing to tell me everything, despite me being a kid.

61
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,010
Alchemists are people who pursue the truth...

62
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,220
...and yet...

63
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,430
...we didn't even know about things so close to us.

64
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,190
So the Colonel is looking at the future that'll take place after he accomplishes his goal.

65
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,570
The future that'll take place after he accomplishes his goal, huh...

66
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,570
Al, what do you plan to do after you get your body back?

67
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,990
Let's see...

68
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:12,870
For starters, I want to taste Winry's apple pie.

69
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,540
What about you, Brother?

70
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,960
I haven't really thought about it, since I've always been so intent on getting my limbs back.

71
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:30,800
I guess I'll start off by going around to Granny and Master and letting them know first.

72
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,600
Yeah, they've really done a lot for us.

73
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,560
They'll all greet us with smiles, right?

74
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,610
Yeah.

75
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,400
We'll be able to see their smiles, right?

76
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,440
Yeah.

77
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,700
We're in a tight spot, but that sort of cheered me up.

78
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,580
I've got something good to tell you, too.

79
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,710
We couldn't use alchemy at that time.

80
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,420
And it turns out others couldn't, either.

81
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,960
Then what about that girl and Scar...

82
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,970
That's right. They were the only ones who could.

83
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,470
There's something different about their alchemy...

84
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,470
Something we're not aware of...

85
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:18,770
Yeah.

86
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,230
We're not at a dead end yet.

87
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:23,730
Left?!

88
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,860
That midget left?!

89
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,530
Yeah. Early this morning.

90
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,650
Did she say where she was headed?!

91
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,820
Nope.

92
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,870
We've got to look for her!

93
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,950
All of Central? Without a single lead?

94
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,540
We do have a lead.

95
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,840
What's this?

96
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,130
A gift.

97
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,340
In that case...

98
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,850
...couldn't you have brought me magazines with a lot of cute girls in 'em?

99
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,600
Don't be slacking off while we're gone, all right?

100
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,600
You're heading off already?

101
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,810
Yeah.

102
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,480
I'm off to taste some western specialty dishes.

103
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,360
You'd better take care of this place while we're gone!

104
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:12,950
I will.

105
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:13,910
Later.

106
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,460
Make sure you eat a lot and grow bigger and stronger.

107
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,170
Protect everyone while I'm away.

108
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,630
Sergeant Fuery.

109
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,460
Hey.

110
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,380
Warrant Officer Falman!

111
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,130
You still haven't left yet?

112
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,930
I came to return something to the Colonel.

113
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,430
It sure was a short stay in Central...

114
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,060
Were you transferred to Southern Headquarters, Sergeant?

115
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,480
Yes, sir. Opposite from you.

116
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,490
I bet it's cold over in Northern Headquarters...

117
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,990
Well then, so long, Sergeant Fuery.

118
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,240
Farewell. May we meet again.

119
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,670
Sorry to bother you, Colonel.

120
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,670
Lieutenant.

121
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,130
I came to pick up something I left here.

122
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,500
I see.

123
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,090
Apparently, Scar is still lurking about.

124
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,890
Then I have to be extra careful.

125
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,270
Since I no longer have a skilled bodyguard.

126
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,230
Please don't die.

127
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:29,940
Of course.

128
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,280
Sorry to put you through so much trouble.

129
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,950
Perhaps I chose the wrong person to follow.

130
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,910
"If I ever stray away from my path, shoot me right away."

131
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,540
That was the deal.

132
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,500
Your actions are still within the permissible range.

133
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,580
You're too kind, Lieutenant.

134
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,710
So long, Colonel.

135
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,010
So long.

136
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,510
Please don't slack off, okay?

137
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,720
Sure...

138
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:15,400
My pawn...

139
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,910
I guess my hobbies got the best of me...

140
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,320
My bishop...

141
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,080
Yes, sir! It is an honor!

142
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,200
My rook...

143
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:26,580
Thanks.

144
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,120
My knight...

145
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,790
I'm stupid, so I had a rough time at the military academy.

146
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,590
And...

147
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,920
If you wish, I'll follow you to the depths of Hell.

148
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,340
...even my queen was taken from me.

149
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,310
But, it's too early...

150
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,020
...for checkmate.

151
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,740
Like this! This is what the cat looks like.

152
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,240
I'm looking for a little girl carrying this thing around.

153
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,160
Sorry, please ignore that alien he's holding up.

154
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:10,540
No one knows anything about that black and white cat...

155
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,210
I wonder if she left Central already?

156
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,420
Fullmetal.

157
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,340
Colonel!

158
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,510
I see. Eastern Alchemy from Xing, huh?

159
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,180
Got it.

160
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,520
I'll ask around about it, too.

161
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,230
To be honest, I didn't really want to ask you for any favors...

162
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,520
Oh, yeah. Speaking of being in debt...

163
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,030
...give me my money back.

164
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,940
Watch where you're going!

165
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,660
So you remembered...

166
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,330
How much do I owe you again? 500 cenz?

167
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,290
520 Cenz!

168
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,370
Don't try to play it off!

169
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,250
What the hell! You're so stingy!

170
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,250
At this rate, you'll never make it big!

171
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,460
Sorry...

172
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,760
Actually, I'm going to hold on to this.

173
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,060
I'll return it when you become the Führer President.

174
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,930
Who told you?

175
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,350
Lieutenant Hawkeye.

176
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,270
She told me about Ishbal, too.

177
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,950
Fullmetal.

178
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,660
You can keep the change for now,

179
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,700
but I'll be getting it back for sure.

180
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,460
When that time comes, I'll borrow money from you again.

181
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,880
With the promise "I'll give this back to you when you turn this country into a democracy".

182
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,260
And when you get that back, I'll borrow from you again and make you agree to something else.

183
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,850
Which means I have a long life ahead of me, huh?

184
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,140
That's right.

185
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,770
Quit worrying the Lieutenant!

186
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,480
Thanks for the ride!

187
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,320
Later.

188
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,160
You sure took a while.

189
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,200
I thought I'd be waiting here until I went bald.

190
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,590
Yo.

191
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,170
Oh, my! Roy!

192
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,590
It's been so long!

193
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,180
You look well, Vanessa.

194
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,680
Long time no see, Roy.

195
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,270
Good evening, Madam Christmas.

196
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,640
How have you been?

197
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,020
Not very well at all.

198
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,770
I came here to liven up.

199
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:39,810
What can I start you out with?

200
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,740
I'm actually recovering right now, so alcohol is a no-no.

201
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,620
I'll be asking for the specialty, Madam.

202
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,620
You got it.

203
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:59,670
Lieutenant General Grumman, you have a call from Central from a lady by the name of Madam Christmas.

204
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,710
Oh?

205
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,420
Seriously... Please don't tell civilians about our secret line.

206
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,390
It just means that I'm not completely useless.

207
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,970
Someone has a task for this old geezer.

208
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:26,490
You lost your arm, failed to protect the young master,
and are now reduced to such a state...

209
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,240
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!

210
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,830
You still call yourself a chosen member of the Yao Clan?!

211
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,830
PLACEHOLDER

212
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,160
PLACEHOLDER

213
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,710
Have some honor!

214
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,660
Cut it out, old man!

215
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,830
She's injured!

216
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,960
I said stop!

217
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,800
Did you really lose it...

218
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,590
Did you really lose your arm...

219
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,640
I'm sorry, Grandfather.

220
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,350
I'm sorry...

221
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,850
Fool...

222
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,940
Fool...

223
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,410
As we promised, we'll set you up with an automail mechanic right away.

224
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,000
No.

225
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,960
Thank you for your consideration.

226
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,080
We shouldn't ask you to help us any further.

227
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,000
We'll somehow find an automail mechanic on our own.

228
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,210
But we can't just leave you like this!

229
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:34,890
Now that the enemy knows what Lan Fan looks like, we can't take any actions that may involve your friend in this.

230
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,310
Okay.

231
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:41,770
Thanks for the consideration.

232
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:48,070
You saved my granddaughter's life.

233
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,530
I thank you.

234
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,370
I ain't a doctor that should be receiving gratitude-

235
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,740
Dr. Nox, thank you so much.

236
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,920
G-Get the hell out of here!

237
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,750
I'm not kind enough to let you weirdos stay forever!

238
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,920
Seriously!

239
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:17,560
It seems the Emperor's condition is worsening by the day.

240
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:23,520
We must get the young master back and return to our country with the stone as soon as possible.

241
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,230
Let's go.

242
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,480
Yes, sir.

243
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,410
Just wait, you fiends.

244
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,790
We shall be back soon.

245
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,860
I'll never forget my gratitude to you for saving me.

246
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,700
Dr. Nox, thank you so much.

247
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,870
And now  I'm starting to act like a doctor after all this?

248
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,250
One sec.

249
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,290
Who is it?

250
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:27,630
Oh.

251
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,710
Hey, Dad.

252
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,170
It's been so long.

253
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,630
Are you doing okay?

254
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,880
Of course.

255
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,680
We had some business around here, so...

256
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,850
You've gotten taller.

257
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,850
Don't you think you've lost some weight?

258
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,440
You're one to talk.

259
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,190
Is your work keeping you busy?

260
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:53,610
Yeah, I've been performing on corpses as always-

261
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,360
Well, wait.

262
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,990
I treated two live patients this week.

263
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,410
Isn't that funny?

264
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,700
Me, saving people's lives?

265
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,920
Dad, I'm studying to become a doctor.

266
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,920
I know that you've been going through a rough time ever since you returned from Ishbal.

267
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:17,010
Yet, you didn't quit your job.

268
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,510
I love you, Dad! As the doctor you are and have always been.

269
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,390
Idiot...

270
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:27,980
Why don't you come in?

271
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,360
The coffee's not too tasty, but have a cup or two.

272
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:39,070
Wow, it's such a mess in here!

273
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:43,450
Come, let's get this place cleaned up while Dad makes us coffee.

274
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:50,380
God, if you really do exist, please overlook this.

275
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:58,300
Even someone like me can enjoy a cup of coffee with his family, right?

276
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:13,310
And with this, Ishbal has completely fallen under the control of the army.

277
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,280
Well done, Major Kimblee.

278
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,490
How do you like the philosopher's stone?

279
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,490
It's wonderful.

280
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:25,120
I was able to perform transmutations beyond my dreams while ignoring the concept of equivalent exchange.

281
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,700
Good.

282
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,460
Make a record of the details and submit it.

283
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,540
Now give us the stone back.

284
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,840
What have you done, Kimblee?!

285
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:41,130
Now, it's only you all who know where the stone is.

286
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,590
You bastard!

287
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,930
What the hell?!

288
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:49,680
What happened?!

289
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,440
What was that?!

290
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,870
Whoops.

291
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,200
Come out, Kimblee. You're being released.

292
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,670
What's this about?

293
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,920
You don't need to know.

294
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,340
Is it an order from the higher-ups?

295
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,970
Shut up.

296
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,430
Besides, why weren't you put on
death row after killing five officers?

297
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,220
What trick did you use?

298
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,390
Nothing in particular.

299
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,850
Maybe it's because of my natural virtues?

300
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,940
Don't make me laugh, you bomberman!

301
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:39,030
What the hell are the higher-ups thinking, releasing a freak like you?

302
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,540
Mr. Jailer, thanks for taking care of me for all this time.

303
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,790
Don't come back again.

304
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,590
Just a token of my gratitude.

305
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,010
Don't tell me...

306
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,510
Wait!

307
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,970
Stop! Please, take it off!

308
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,260
Kimblee!!!

309
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,770
It's a boring old toy.

310
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,320
Please give it to your kid or something.

311
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,450
Well then, farewell.

312
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,290
Now...

313
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,340
It's been a while, Kimblee.

314
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,510
Congratulations on your release.

315
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,050
So it was you all who let me out.

316
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:49,890
Yup.

317
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,600
We've run into a labor shortage.

318
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:55,270
Which means, you have a job for me?

319
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,400
Do you happen to remember Doctor Marcoh?

320
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,570
The scientist who helped create the philosopher's stone, right?

321
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,030
I remember him very clearly.

322
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,570
He may...

323
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,200
...have escaped.

324
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,240
"May have"?

325
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,870
It's still not clear yet.

326
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,250
One of the chimeras we placed as a watchdog was gone.

327
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,500
Marcoh is an alchemist especially skilled in organic transmutation.

328
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,170
The corpse may have been a substitute.

329
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,090
And to make matters worse,

330
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:29,640
there's a possibility he's on the run with Scar, an Ishbalan.

331
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,100
So, how does that sound to you...

332
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,230
...as someone who was ordered to annihilate Ishbal, the Crimson Alchemist?

333
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,190
Let's see...

334
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:44,480
If it's an Ishbalan that I forgot to kill, then it's hard to let this one pass.

335
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,070
You're allowed to kill Scar on sight.

336
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,660
But bring Marcoh back alive.

337
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,040
You released me from jail for something like that?

338
00:19:55,290 --> 00:20:00,790
Once we capture Marcoh, we're going to wipe a town off the map just to show him who he's messing with.

339
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,090
Isn't that a pleasant job?

340
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,340
You're really a nasty person, aren't you?

341
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,470
I can finally use this, after all this time.

342
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,770
That may not be enough if we're
planning to destroy an entire town.

343
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,770
Wow...

344
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,360
Did you make this out of Ishbalans, too?

345
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,820
It's made out of the guys who were researching the stone under Doctor Marcoh.

346
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,070
You truly are nasty.

347
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,910
Why did you help me escape?

348
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,460
I...

349
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,790
There are still things I need to ask you.

350
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,710
About the alchemist named Kimblee, and...

351
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,220
...there were parts I couldn't understand in the research documents my brother left me.

352
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,010
Research documents?

353
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,430
"There's something strange about this country's alchemy" are the words he left me before he died.

354
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,520
Something about that should be written in the documents.

355
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,690
You're a skilled alchemist.

356
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,440
You'll be able to comprehend it, won't you?

357
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,780
Something strange about this country's alchemy?

358
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,990
Master. The little girl came back.

359
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,410
Mister Scar! You were okay!

360
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,040
Huh? We have another friend with us?

361
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,670
He's not a friend.

362
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,170
His name is Marcoh.

363
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:30,260
He's a man who created a philosopher's stone and assisted in the Ishbalan Extermination.

364
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:33,220
A philosopher's stone! For immortality?!

365
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,470
Mister Marcoh, do you know how to make the stone?!

366
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,350
How?! Please, tell me!

367
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,440
Well, that's...

368
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:43,640
Stop.

369
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,730
You shouldn't wish for such a thing.

370
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,540
I only destroyed the exterior of his face.

371
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,250
Please stop his bleeding.

372
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,460
Okay!

373
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,090
It's better to destroy his face so others won't be able to tell who he really is.

374
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:12,090
Are you okay, Mister Marcoh?

375
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,010
Let's go.

376
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,970
Huh? To where?

377
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,430
To the place I hid the documents.

378
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,520
North.

379
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:37,750
Even if we part and meet again, I want to meet at this place.

380
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:37,750
Megurimeguttemo mata koko de aitai

381
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:44,680
Then we'll hold hands to ensure we'll never be separated again.

382
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:44,680
Hagurenaiyouni kono te wo tsunagunda

383
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,310
We used to talk all night until the sun rose,

384
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,310
Asahi ga noboru made katariattane

385
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:50,140
And held hands till the sun went under the horizon.

386
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:50,140
Yuuhi ga shizumu made tsunaida te

387
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:55,390
Let's walk together like this forever, like light and shadow.

388
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:55,390
Kouyatte asu mo asatte mo tomo ni ayumou hikari to kage

389
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,940
I stand in the city, staring off into space with lonely eyes.

390
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,940
Samishige ni mitsumeru machi no naka de

391
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:05,280
I can't find warmth on my own.

392
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:05,280
Nukumori wa hitori ja mitsukaranakute

393
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,790
By meeting you, I realized

394
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,790
Ai ga konnani tsuyosa ni narukoto

395
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:16,620
Shittanda kimi ni deaete hajimete

396
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:16,620
How much strength love could give me.

397
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,880
Even if we part and meet again, I want to meet at this place.

398
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,880
Megurimeguttemo mata koko de aitai

399
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:27,180
Then we'll hold hands to ensure we'll never be separated again.

400
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:27,180
Hagurenaiyouni kono te wo tsunagunda

401
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:32,390
I can't sleep by myself, 'cause I can't dream without you.

402
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:32,390
Hitori ja nemurenai yume wa mirenaikara

403
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:38,150
So take me to a place where uncertainty can't reach us

404
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:38,150
Donna fuan mo todokanai tokoro e

405
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:43,400
And let us bring light to the night sky with no stars.

406
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:43,400
Hoshi no yoru mo terashitsuzukeyou

407
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,900
So long as you're with me, I can go to world's end.

408
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,900
Doko made mo yukeru kimi to nara

409
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,910
Even if it's a path I can't walk on my own,

410
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,910
Hitori ja arukenai michi mo futari nara

411
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,950
If you're by my side, I can walk it while humming a tune.

412
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,950
Hanauta utainagara arukerunda

413
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:55,370
If we're together, the world is mine.

414
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:55,370
Kimi ga ireba shiawase

415
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,640
The figure hidden all this time reveals himself with a smile.

416
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,730
With that, a new threat endangers the tangled web Central is.

417
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:14,400
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

418
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,370
Episode 32, The Führer's Son.

419
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:19,370
The Führer's Son

420
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,490
Would it be better to not know?

421
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,580
Or perhaps...
