1
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,870
Can't focus. My body is still puzzled about what to do.

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,870
Shuuchuu dekitenaina mada karada ga mayotteirunda

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,630
I'm trembling. I can't stop even if I try to control myself.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,630
Furueteitanja kontoroorushitatte burerunda

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,380
Although neither sun nor moon are on my side,

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,380
Taiyou mo tsuki mo nanmo kanzen ni kocchi muiteinaiga

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,800
"I've no choice but to try,"

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,800
Yarushikanainda

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,470
Those were the words I muttered to myself.

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,470
Iikikaseruyouni sotto tsubuyaita

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,060
The odds aren't on my side, but running way'd be gutless.

12
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,060
Joukyou wa waruiga tada nigedasunja konjou nainaa

13
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,060
Even if I can't see the future, I'll just have to win it over with courage.

14
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,060
Tenbou wa naiga dokyou de kuria suru shika naiya

15
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,560
Need to keep distance from the target as I hold myself back.

16
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,560
Shoudou wa osaetamama taagetto to no kankaku sagure

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,860
All that's needed for victory is pride to win.

18
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,860
Hitsuyou na mon wa katsu puraido

19
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,950
Will we celebrate with the wine of victory

20
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,950
Ajiwau nowa shouri no bishu ka

21
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,950
Or'll we end up kissing their feet in defeat?

22
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,950
Soretomo haiboku no kujuu ka

23
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,700
There are two outcomes to everything.

24
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,700
Sou subete wa futatsu ni hitotsu

25
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,420
I want to control destiny.

26
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,420
Ayatsuritai unmei no ito

27
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,750
I need to seize the golden opportunity with my hands.

28
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,750
Zekkou no goorudentaimu kono te de tsukame

29
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,840
I'll finish it up with my best poker face,

30
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,840
Konshin no pookaafeisu kimete shikakeruyo

31
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,800
And drag them into a world of illusions.

32
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,800
Iryuujon no sekai e hikizurikonde

33
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,140
I'll find my way out of this endless pressure game,

34
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,140
Saigennai puresshaageemu sururito nukete

35
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,150
And leap over the borderline of honor.

36
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,150
Eikou no boodaarain tobikoeru tameni

37
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,860
Haumenii? Dorekurai no daishou ga iru?

38
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,860
How many? What'll I need to sacrifice to make it happen?

39
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,120
What is the one thing I don't want to let go?

40
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,120
Tebanashitakunai mon wa dore?

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Shape of This Country

42
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,900
I'll show you how we do things at Briggs.

43
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,690
"How you do things at Briggs"?

44
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,400
That's right.

45
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,280
Lend us a hand, alchemist!

46
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,490
Brother!

47
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,910
You, too!

48
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,660
Hang on! We're...

49
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,710
You were threatened and forced to help.

50
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,170
No one can blame you for that, right?

51
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,750
Who's this?

52
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,420
He's our bro.

53
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,010
Okay. You're helping, too.

54
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,170
Pick up the pace! And don't spill any of it!

55
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,010
Buccaneer! Carry those to Gate 8!

56
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:07,680
Yes, sir!

57
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,470
Charge!

58
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,310
Shove him into the elevator!

59
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,620
What... a drag...

60
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,790
Push! Push!

61
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,460
All right! We can do this!

62
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,080
Turret, turn to starboard!

63
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,790
Yes, ma'am...

64
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,670
Miles, send him away!

65
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,130
Aye, ma'am!

66
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,310
All right! We did it!

67
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,570
Where... am I?

68
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,540
Now! Let him have it!

69
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,250
Good job!

70
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,170
Now what?

71
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,430
How do we throw him out of the gate?

72
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,430
This stuff smells.

73
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,020
Move, brat!

74
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,910
Hey! One more round!

75
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,870
We're out of ammo!

76
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,750
In that case...

77
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,920
That hurt...

78
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,100
All right!

79
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,560
It's north-blend fuel.

80
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:24,980
It vaporizes even in extremely low temperatures,
and with that, it absorbs body temperature in no time.

81
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,650
On top of that, we're in the middle of a blizzard.

82
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,530
He'll freeze all the way to his brain.

83
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,700
So cold...

84
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,490
My body...

85
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,170
...won't... move...

86
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,050
What... a drag...

87
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,020
Hibernate until spring comes around, dimwit.

88
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,400
Buccaneer, haul these three down.

89
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,270
Roger!

90
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,320
What?!

91
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,320
W-W-Whoa!

92
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,110
W-W-Why?!

93
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,450
We helped you!

94
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,320
"You were forced to."

95
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,320
Wouldn't that be more convenient for you?

96
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:21,080
And I'm not letting you get away until the identity of that monster becomes clear, so be prepared.

97
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,340
It's cold.

98
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,510
"Clang"?

99
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,140
Morning, Brother.

100
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,430
Oh, that's right.

101
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,890
Yo! Did you have a nice nap?

102
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,310
I did, but...

103
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,780
So I hear you saved our men.

104
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,030
Thanks.

105
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,280
That'll be 100 cenz.

106
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,450
This wasn't out of gratitude?!

107
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:01,080
Umm... are there any news?

108
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,790
The advance unit went to check up on that hole.

109
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,790
They should be back any moment now.

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,130
Oh, and Major Miles is at the hospital.

111
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,300
Hospital?

112
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,090
He's there to see the guy who was injured while fighting Scar.

113
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,260
Scar is up north, too?

114
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,430
Oh, there you are.

115
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,350
He's awake.

116
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,680
Thanks for yesterday.

117
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,100
You saved our buddies' lives.

118
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,440
You guys really care about your buddies, don't you?

119
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,480
We at Briggs consider ourselves a monolith.

120
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,400
And since you saved our buddies, that makes you one, too.

121
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,410
Then can't you let your buddy out of-

122
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,200
No can do.

123
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,870
You guys really are a monolith...

124
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,710
Apparently, Scar's body wasn't found at the scene of the accident.

125
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,130
There's a possibility he's lurking in the area.

126
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,710
Yes.

127
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,460
Good lord...

128
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,720
First, the cat... and now we also need to search for Scar?

129
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Understood.

130
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,520
Leave Scar to us and focus on getting better.

131
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,940
Wait a second.

132
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,860
I want you all to stay out of this.

133
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:13,360
The Ishbalan is my prey.

134
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,490
Unfortunately for you, we're not so soft as to let
a mass murderer do whatever he wants here at Briggs.

135
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,950
We believe in the survival of the fittest.

136
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,420
If you let your guard down for a second, you die. Understand?

137
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:32,210
Talk shit again, and you'll never be able to leave the hospital.

138
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,470
We at Briggs have been commanded to take care of you.

139
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,800
So stay put.

140
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,480
Just as I remember. Ishbalans are so interesting.

141
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,570
Are you doing all right, Kimblee?

142
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:59,070
You got here sooner than I'd expected, Lieutenant General Raven.

143
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,570
I rushed here after I heard about your injury.

144
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,580
You had me worried.

145
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:07,790
This is what you're worried about, right?

146
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,460
Very well.

147
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,920
Now, time to get to work.

148
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,880
But as you can see, I'm...

149
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,180
I brought a doctor well-versed in alchemy.

150
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,180
And we have the stone.

151
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,680
You'll be well in no time.

152
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,690
Eastern Alchemy is quite difficult.

153
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,450
Especially this whole concept of the "veins of the dragon".

154
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,700
It's to describe the power running through the earth.

155
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,700
Power running through the earth?

156
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,830
Simply put,

157
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:55,920
it's a power that goes back into the ground after erupting from the summit of a mountain, and enriches the earth.

158
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,710
Think of it as a river that runs through the earth.

159
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,550
By understanding that flow of strength, its entrances and exits...

160
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,600
You can apply it to practically anything.

161
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,110
When you say "anything", does this apply to the human body, as well?

162
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,110
Yes, it does!

163
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,030
For example... your hip!

164
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,820
My foot...

165
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,860
Or, right here!

166
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,950
Why did I feel that in my eyes after having my neck pressed?

167
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,040
You need to take care of your body, Dr. Marcoh.

168
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,620
The power in your body is stagnant in many places.

169
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,210
I-I see now...

170
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,130
So this is what makes long-distance transmutation possible.

171
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,890
So your alchemy doesn't use the veins of the dragon?

172
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:49,100
Yeah. We use the energy created by tectonic movements.

173
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:54,140
The immense amount of energy that is released by earthquakes and volcanic activity.

174
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,940
This country's alchemy uses that energy.

175
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,150
But that's not it.

176
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:05,030
Ever since I stepped foot in this country, I felt like something was out of place...

177
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,280
I finally realized what once I went underground in Central...

178
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,790
...but this power, which flows beneath our feet...

179
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,370
...feels more like it's coming from thousands of people squirming about...

180
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:22,460
...rather than energy created by tectonic movement.

181
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,100
It's huge.

182
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,350
A platoon should be able to get through.

183
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:39,610
The tunnel goes on indefinitely, following a loose curve.

184
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,860
But there aren't any signs of people down there.

185
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,900
Take the horses down.

186
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,070
Yes, ma'am!

187
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,700
And bring those three, too.

188
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,870
Wow... It really is huge.

189
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,340
I can't believe we let him break in without noticing all this was going on...

190
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:04,340
So this is the first time Briggs has been invaded?

191
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,630
Since I came here, yes.

192
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:12,640
But around twenty years ago, there was a case when our security guards were attacked during midwinter.

193
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:17,810
Apparently, a mysterious woman kept stealing food and supplies from them for an entire month.

194
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,900
I survived in Briggs in the winter for a month!

195
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,530
It has to be her...

196
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,030
I guess this is far enough.

197
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,860
Get off.

198
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,030
Now...

199
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:36,040
You don't have to worry about anyone eavesdropping on us down here.

200
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,040
Tell me everything you know.

201
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,040
I mean everything.

202
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,130
Don't hide anything.

203
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,180
When I asked you about the monster, you asked me to try to realize your situation, did you not?

204
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,770
More or less, you believed that I would realize your situation.

205
00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:01,810
You could have been killed at any time in that situation, yet you still summoned those words.

206
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,820
So I figured you had something to protect,
even if it meant you'd lose your life doing so.

207
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,820
For example, a hostage.

208
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,820
I want you to cut the bullshit.

209
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,620
Tell me the truth.

210
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,170
We need your help.

211
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,340
Philosopher's stones... Homunculi...

212
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,050
King Bradley, and a man who is referred to as Father...

213
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,310
And the entire upper echelon is guilty....

214
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,020
So as we thought, people were being taken hostage.

215
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:42,400
A friend of yours who is an automail mechanic and Mustang's men...

216
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:48,780
We performed many joint drills with Eastern Headquarters, so I know Hawkeye and Havoc.

217
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,530
It would be a big loss to lose them.

218
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,200
I wish I could do something.

219
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,490
Umm... what about Colonel Mustang?

220
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,120
Oh... I don't really care about him.

221
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,960
It would actually be better for me if he just falls, so I have one less rival to worry about.

222
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,460
More importantly, we need to decide what to do now.

223
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,130
How do you alchemists see this underground path?

224
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:26,190
I don't think this tunnel was dug from Drachma.

225
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:32,950
This is only a hypothesis, but it seems as though this tunnel was dug to create a large circle.

226
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:33,740
A circle?

227
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:39,740
A circle governs the circulation of power in alchemy and is an important factor.

228
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,500
Now, for the equation...

229
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:50,260
Lieutenant Falman, do you know the major incidents within the country that resulted in a lot of bloodshed?

230
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,380
Bloodshed?

231
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,720
How would that...

232
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:04,140
The Riviere Incident in July of 1558.

233
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,400
Let's see... Riviere.

234
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:11,530
The civil war in Cameron in October of 1661.

235
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,200
The Soapman incident, February 1799.

236
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,620
That happened in Fisk.

237
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,160
The Wellsley Conflict, March 1811.

238
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:29,170
The First Southern Border Conflict occurred in
October of 1835, northwest of where South City is today.

239
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,050
The Second Southern Border Conflict happened in May of 1911, just south of Fortsett.

240
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,180
What about Pendleton to the west?

241
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:41,680
Many soldiers have died there in the battles against Creta, a neighboring nation.

242
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:46,310
And the riot in Liore, in 1914.

243
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,690
Severe casualties.

244
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,940
Wai-

245
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,020
A riot?! Why?!

246
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:57,450
Didn't we report the situation to Eastern Headquarters immediately after we exposed the fake priest?!

247
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,870
It was the Central army.

248
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:03,080
They came and made the Eastern army withdraw.

249
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,410
Liore turned into a mess after that.

250
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,710
No way...

251
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,630
Dammit!

252
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:11,170
Continue what you were doing earlier, Fullmetal.

253
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,590
I know.

254
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,930
Now we're going to connect the dots.

255
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,230
How could this be?!

256
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:29,560
It's almost identical to the transmutation circle we found under Research Laboratory 5!

257
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:34,230
A circle for creating a philosopher's stone, which uses human lives...

258
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:39,490
Just how many people will die with such a large transmutation circle?!

259
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:46,500
I once asked Envy if they were trying to create a philosopher's stone using this country.

260
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,500
But he laughed and told me I was close.

261
00:15:53,090 --> 00:16:00,510
In the past, I told Edward that he'd surely be able to realize the real truth, which lies beyond the truth.

262
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:06,020
What I meant by the "truth" was that the stones are made of live humans.

263
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,150
And what I meant by "beyond the truth" is the existence of the ones behind it.

264
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:17,150
And the truth beyond the truth is the transmutation of a philosopher's stone using the entire nation.

265
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:20,110
But that's not where it ends.

266
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,870
We don't know what they're planning to do in the end.

267
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:27,160
We also don't know about immortality, which is what you're looking for.

268
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,920
So you mustn't long for a philosopher's stone.

269
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:38,720
We must decipher this research by combining my knowledge of alchemy and your knowledge of Eastern Alchemy.

270
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,670
Right.

271
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,680
The oldest one was in 1558...

272
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,640
Right after Amestris was founded.

273
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:56,020
Without even a declaration of war, Amestris invaded Riviere, which was once a neighboring country...

274
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:57,440
Hang on!

275
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:00,450
This is...

276
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,870
The military is involved in every one of these incidents.

277
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:08,790
The coup d'etat... the civil wars... and Liore, too.

278
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,330
The Central Army came out and poured oil on the flames.

279
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,670
Ever since this nation was created?!

280
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:22,970
Our country started out as a small nation, but we expanded by annexing the small countries around us.

281
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,720
So it was to create this circle?

282
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:35,980
So it wasn't their plan to use this country to do something, but they created this country to realize their task.

283
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,400
Our country...

284
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,820
So, Mr. Hughes...

285
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,240
Yeah. He saw the transmutation circle for the stone before he died.

286
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,080
Since he worked in the building they have strategy meetings in,
he had access to more resources than anyone else.

287
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,960
He was the first to realize there was something wrong with this country-

288
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:02,170
Dog of the military. State Alchemist!

289
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:06,340
Do you have any idea what this country is trying to do?!

290
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:11,720
Do you really think all this prosperity was created with the powers of humans only?

291
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,730
If you did  know, you'd understand why I'm doing this!

292
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,440
I don't like this!

293
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:23,990
Looking at the pattern, the next area that will see bloodshed...

294
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,660
The only area left is Briggs!

295
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:33,200
What do those pigs at Central plan to do with my castle?!

296
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,620
Major General!

297
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,960
Please return to base at once.

298
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,630
Lieutenant General Raven has come to visit from Central.

299
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,380
So they're not even giving us time to think, huh?

300
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,260
Major General Armstrong.

301
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,640
There's something I'd like to ask of you.

302
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,140
Could you try and trick Lieutenant General Raven?

303
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:01,980
I'm sorry for making you wait, Lieutenant General Raven.

304
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,150
No, worry not.

305
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,780
It's my fault for coming here without advance notice.

306
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,200
Major General Armstrong will be back shortly.

307
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,160
Please, follow me-

308
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,080
Oh, that's right.

309
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,040
I've brought a guest with me.

310
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:18,790
Major Miles, do you mind giving him a tour of the fort?

311
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,880
Nice to meet you, Major Miles.

312
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,760
Winry's apple pie.

313
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,020
The thing I said I'd like to eat when I get my body back.

314
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:39,730
I guess we have more important things to think about now.

315
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,190
Don't worry, you'll be able to eat it someday.

316
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:50,870
After we get our bodies back and beat the crap out of those guys planning to use this country for their own goals.

317
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,580
Yeah.

318
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,580
Sorry for the mess, Lieutenant General.

319
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,040
We were attacked by the enemy.

320
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,080
Attacked?

321
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:05,880
We were able to drive it off,
but the thing was... what you'd call a monster.

322
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,670
What do you mean by monster?

323
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,840
It didn't die no matter what we did to it.

324
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,470
Oh, my.

325
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,350
That sounds troublesome.

326
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:23,110
Personally, I think it's a biological weapon from Drachma, but the Elric Brothers...

327
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,950
We've taken in the Fullmetal Alchemist and his younger brother by chance.

328
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,830
It seems as though they know something about the monster but won't say anything.

329
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:43,380
It could be a disaster if a state alchemist who works with the Führer President is a Drachman spy, so we've arrested them.

330
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,960
Would you like to see them?

331
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,340
I guess so.

332
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,300
They really won't say anything?

333
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,340
Yes.

334
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:56,100
They also claim they came here to research organic transmutation or something.

335
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,350
They're being quite ambiguous. I couldn't doubt them more.

336
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:10,070
I thought about torturing it out of them, but I'm technically a woman, too.

337
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,490
I couldn't lay a finger on a child like that.

338
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,990
My heart would be crushed...

339
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:16,660
Yeah, right.

340
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,500
That queen's made of ice to the core.

341
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:26,920
So even you, who holds the title of "The Northern Wall of Briggs", has a soft spot for children, huh?

342
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:36,010
It wouldn't be odd to have a child or two at my age,
but I'm totally behind in those affairs.

343
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,720
What are you talking about?

344
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,720
You must be much sought after by the men.

345
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,020
No, no.

346
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:45,520
It's such a sad experience to age, isn't it?

347
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,770
I'm absolutely horrified of aging.

348
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,030
That biological weapon from Drachma had a wonderful body.

349
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,740
An immortal body.

350
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,120
Isn't it like a dream?

351
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:07,250
What if I were to tell you that it may not be long before it isn't just a dream?

352
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,590
Say, Major General...

353
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,600
Are you interested in a perfect, immortal army?

354
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,270
He fell for it!

355
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:37,870
Even if we part and meet again, I want to meet at this place.

356
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:37,870
Megurimeguttemo mata koko de aitai

357
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:44,800
Then we'll hold hands to ensure we'll never be separated again.

358
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:44,800
Hagurenaiyouni kono te wo tsunagunda

359
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,430
We used to talk all night until the sun rose,

360
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,430
Asahi ga noboru made katariattane

361
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:50,260
And held hands till the sun went under the horizon.

362
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:50,260
Yuuhi ga shizumu made tsunaida te

363
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:55,510
Let's walk together like this forever, like light and shadow.

364
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:55,510
Kouyatte asu mo asatte mo tomo ni ayumou hikari to kage

365
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,060
I stand in the city, staring off into space with lonely eyes.

366
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,060
Samishige ni mitsumeru machi no naka de

367
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:05,400
I can't find warmth on my own.

368
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:05,400
Nukumori wa hitori ja mitsukaranakute

369
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,910
By meeting you, I realized

370
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,910
Ai ga konnani tsuyosa ni narukoto

371
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:16,740
How much strength love could give me.

372
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:16,740
Shittanda kimi ni deaete hajimete

373
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:22,000
Even if we part and meet again, I want to meet at this place.

374
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:22,000
Megurimeguttemo mata koko de aitai

375
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,300
Then we'll hold hands to ensure we'll never be separated again.

376
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,300
Hagurenaiyouni kono te wo tsunagunda

377
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:32,510
I can't sleep by myself, 'cause I can't dream without you.

378
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:32,510
Hitori ja nemurenai yume wa mirenaikara

379
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:38,270
So take me to a place where uncertainty can't reach us

380
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:38,270
Donna fuan mo todokanai tokoro e

381
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:43,520
And let us bring light to the night sky with no stars.

382
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:43,520
Hoshi no yoru mo terashitsuzukeyou

383
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:46,020
So long as you're with me, I can go to world's end.

384
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:46,020
Doko made mo yukeru kimi to nara

385
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:49,030
Even if it's a path I can't walk on my own,

386
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:49,030
Hitori ja arukenai michi mo futari nara

387
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:52,070
If you're by my side, I can walk it while humming a tune.

388
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:52,070
Hanauta utainagara arukerunda

389
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:55,490
If we're together, the world is mine.

390
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:55,490
Kimi ga ireba shiawase

391
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,040
"Obey the ones with power".

392
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,420
That's the true meaning of the law of the jungle.

393
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:08,210
If you don't wish to be bound by that, obtain greater power.

394
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:13,590
Because there's always times one must fight power with power.

395
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:18,430
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

396
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:22,180
Episode 36, Family Portrait.

397
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:22,210
Family Portrait

398
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,440
Men set out on journeys with determination in their hearts.
