1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,150
The new morning we've finally found

2
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,150
Yatto mitsuketa atarashii asa wa

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,190
is being hampered by the past.

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,190
Tsukihi ga jama wo suru

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,660
What we chased after wasn't the future,

6
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,660
Mukau saki wa tsugi ja nakute

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,490
but the past so full of remorse.

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,490
Sugi bakari oikaketa

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,960
Nariyamanai yousha nai omoide tachi wa

10
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,960
The ruthless memories won't stop playing;

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,050
they won't be forgiving us for a long time.

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,050
Yurushite kuresou nimonai

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,890
It's about now that a teardrop

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,890
Sorosoro kana tesaguri tsukareta hoho wo

15
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,560
beings to roll down my fatigued cheeks.

16
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,560
Kattou ga koboreochiru

17
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,810
Will this rain ever stop?

18
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,810
Ame wa itsuka yamunodeshouka

19
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:52,030
Zuibun nagai aida tsumetai

20
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:52,030
I've been freezing for a long time.

21
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,320
Why does the rain continue to fix on me?

22
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,320
Ame wa doushite boku wo erabuno

23
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,080
I wonder if it could embrace me.

24
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,080
Tsutsumarete iikana

25
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,870
Today, the rain falls again;

26
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,870
Ame wa yamu koto wo shirazuni

27
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,090
endlessly it falls knowing no end.

28
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,090
Kyou mo furitsuzukukeredo

29
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,130
Sotto sashidashita kasa no naka de

30
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,130
We nestle close to each other to share the warmth

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:28,850
under this umbrella, you gently held out to me.

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:28,850
Nukumori ni yorisoinagara

33
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,340
Calm down...

34
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,260
I want to talk to you...

35
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,140
Please, just listen to me...

36
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,560
And you too, talk to me...

37
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,520
Yes... that's right...

38
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:11,190
You're... not alone...

39
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,850
Golden hair...

40
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,430
He must have come from the west.

41
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,140
Well, we should at least bury him.

42
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,900
He's alive!

43
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,110
You're kidding me!

44
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:55,900
Get yourself together!

45
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,900
Hey, are you all right?!

46
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,240
Water! Bring him some water!

47
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,290
Don't drink it in one gulp. Take it slow.

48
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,290
Can you understand our language?

49
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,500
We're merchants from Xing.

50
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,170
Where were you headed?

51
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,800
I have nowhere to return to...

52
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,970
I also have nowhere to go...

53
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,600
I was afraid of staying in Xerxes, so I ran...

54
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,440
You're right...

55
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,440
I'm sorry...

56
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,490
I couldn't stop him...

57
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,070
I'm sorry...!

58
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,780
I'm sorry, Sergence...!

59
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,220
The Return of the Führer

60
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,470
Sergence was a master carpenter.

61
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,260
He often came to the palace for repairs.

62
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,180
Remember him?

63
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:15,020
And his son, Dozle, looked up to his father and worked hard in order to succeed him.

64
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,610
And Caiya, the florist girl.

65
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,150
She was kind and thoughtful.

66
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,070
Sari, the horse owner, really loved to drink.

67
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,870
We got along well.

68
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,710
Little boy Tommy's dream was to become a scholar.

69
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,080
Gidalush was a chef.

70
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,260
He once got fired for giving a free meal to a traveler with no money.

71
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,550
Andal, a fellow slave,

72
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,760
hated me for gaining the master's favor.

73
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:54,270
Zul was a hopeless villain and was only awaiting his execution,

74
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,150
but he apparently wants to get back at you before that.

75
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,730
Get back at me?

76
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,280
Those are the souls that just infiltrated your body.

77
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:27,590
They're cooperating with me for the sole purpose of defeating you.

78
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,680
You're saying that the philosopher's stone is working together with you, each one retaining its own will?

79
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,100
When they're nothing but an energy form?

80
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,650
Do you think it's impossible?

81
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:46,490
It almost drove me nuts to deal with these crazed souls one by one.

82
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:51,280
But I had plenty of time to talk to them.

83
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,250
Thanks to this immortal body you gave me.

84
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,460
You talked to them?

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,210
That's right.

86
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,800
And that's precisely what you didn't do.

87
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:16,270
I've already spoken to every single one of the 536329 people inside me.

88
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,540
D-Damn you...!

89
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,460
Go back to where you came from,

90
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,840
Dwarf in the Flask, Homunculus.

91
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,340
Sorry, but I'm going to be destroying your container.

92
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:58,390
Tearing apart your skin is the same thing as breaking your flask.

93
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,350
You'll turn into dust.

94
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,570
Experience the will of the ones you looked down on.

95
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:43,850
Aren't you the one who's looking down on someone, Hohenheim?

96
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,400
You can survive even after abandoning your skin?

97
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,450
Don't think for a moment that you fools are the only ones who progressed.

98
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:00,160
Didn't I tell you that I'll become a perfect being?

99
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,630
What?!

100
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,090
A frontal attack?!

101
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:20,350
Why must I enter my own castle through the back door?

102
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,480
Infantry, retreat!

103
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,190
Impossible!

104
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,610
Did we get him?!

105
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,410
Take over the steering!

106
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,820
Y-Yes sir!

107
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Dammit!

108
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Where are you?!

109
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,200
Damn you...

110
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,500
You took down a tank by yourself?!

111
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,300
Captain!

112
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,030
Captain Buccaneer!

113
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,740
What's the matter?

114
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,870
The master has returned.

115
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,910
Open the gate.

116
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,540
Open the gate, Falman.

117
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:58,380
I'm sorry, Colonel Mustang...

118
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,970
This may become my grave...

119
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,810
Hey, hey.

120
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,020
Stop trying to act cool with a lame face like that.

121
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:16,820
If it's about manliness, I can't lose to anyone either.

122
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,530
I can still fight!

123
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,820
Rubbish.

124
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:27,330
This is what people call 'recklessness'.

125
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,330
Exactly.

126
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:34,380
Letting your passions run wild and barking won't get you far at all.

127
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,130
But for some reason...

128
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,510
I can't bring myself to abandon people like that.

129
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,820
Dammit!

130
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,030
They've started to make a comeback now that the Führer President has returned!

131
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,780
If they get past this place, they'll take back the main gate!

132
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,030
Hold out no matter what!

133
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,040
Yes.

134
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:13,920
What?!

135
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,790
Are you serious?!

136
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,920
Madam Bradley!

137
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,300
The Führer President is fine!

138
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,260
He's alive!

139
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,940
I'm so glad...

140
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,230
Are you okay?

141
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,070
Yes, I'm fine.

142
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,150
I'm so glad...

143
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,070
He's alive...

144
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,410
Is he hurt?!

145
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,870
I don't have the details on that yet.

146
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:58,000
All I know is that he's wiping out the Briggs soldiers at Central Headquarters.

147
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,840
Should we blame it on Briggs?

148
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,920
But...!

149
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,170
It's to protect Colonel Mustang.

150
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,550
Yeah.

151
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,890
For starters, it's great news that the Führer President is safe.

152
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,270
Yes.

153
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,360
I just hope Selim is safe and sound as well...

154
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,400
If he's fighting against the Briggs soldiers,

155
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,450
it must mean that Major General Armstrong is the mastermind behind the coup d'etat.

156
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,200
Armstrong?

157
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,870
Oh...

158
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,330
The female general who came to Central a little while ago.

159
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:37,420
Now the real problem is, how much of the upper echelon is involved?

160
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,130
So he was alive...

161
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,800
We can't underestimate a Homunculus, after all.

162
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:51,390
The fact that we pretended to be on the
Führer President's side came back to haunt us.

163
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:55,640
We had to make Major General Armstrong out to be the villain...

164
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,280
This place is getting dangerous as well.

165
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,490
Yeah.

166
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,820
I wonder what's going to happen to us.

167
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,620
I don't know.

168
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,700
We've said that we're on the Führer President's side,

169
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,880
so I doubt they'll fire at us so easily.

170
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,840
But what if Bradley comes back into full control again?

171
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,300
We'll probably get crushed like ants.

172
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,050
Even if the madam is here?!

173
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,180
Do you honestly think they're that compassionate?

174
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,860
It's been a while.

175
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,610
You should have just run off somewhere after that.

176
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,870
Unfortunately, I'm as greedy as can be.

177
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,660
I want your life too, Wrath.

178
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,930
Reinforcements... I'm assuming?

179
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:17,560
Everyone in town was saying that you died in a train wreck.

180
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,730
How did you survive?

181
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,560
My eyes are too keen.

182
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:33,780
It only takes a moment to decide the route I need to take to escape through the rubble.

183
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,910
But I really am getting old.

184
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,380
My body can't handle things as well as it could back then.

185
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,880
He can do all this even if his body isn't at its peak?

186
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:53,180
Lin Yao... right?

187
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,720
Wow!

188
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,850
I haven't seen you since you let me stay in your beat-up apartment!

189
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,140
It's been a while, Warrant Officer Falman.

190
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,270
I'm a Second Lieutenant now!

191
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,480
I owe you for a night's lodging and a meal.

192
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,400
Let me lend you a hand.

193
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,780
He said that, but both of us are actually just doing this for ourselves!

194
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,630
Trying to get into my blind spot?

195
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:37,930
My partner inside me taught me how to fight you.

196
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,390
I see.

197
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,230
Then I'll do this.

198
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,740
He's starting to get pushed back.

199
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,280
Isn't this looking bad for him?

200
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,330
Fire! Fire!

201
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,370
Shoot!

202
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,590
Idiots! Don't interfere!

203
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,720
D-Damn you!!

204
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,020
Captain!

205
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,330
Seems like you have a sturdy set of abs.

206
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,080
Now you won't be able to use your sword.

207
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,460
Don't be reckless, moron!

208
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,170
But...!

209
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,960
Good job!

210
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,550
Christ...

211
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,180
I'm not too used to wielding these weapons.

212
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,520
Not bad, old man.

213
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,790
The Führer President has returned?

214
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:29,540
Yes, sir.

215
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,790
He's currently engaged in combat with an unidentified man.

216
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:43,720
We're going to gather more men, wipe out the small fries from Briggs,

217
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,930
and rescue the Führer President.

218
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,180
Replenish weapons and fill in vacancies.

219
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,850
Regain the main gate.

220
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:50,650
Yes, sir!

221
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,360
Go! Go! Go!

222
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,780
This is bad!

223
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,450
The Central Soldiers have gotten back up!

224
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,620
My bad!

225
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,880
I've already got my hands full with him!

226
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,540
I'm leaving the rest to you guys!

227
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,920
What?!

228
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,840
What are we supposed to do when they have so many more men than us?!

229
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,090
Figure something out!

230
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,720
"Figure something out"?

231
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,470
Captain! Hang in there!

232
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,430
We'll have to do just that...

233
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,270
Hey!

234
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,480
You all carry Captain Buccaneer somewhere safe!

235
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,400
Roger!

236
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,730
We're going to move that.

237
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,440
Roger!

238
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,300
Dammit! We're being held back by two machine guns?!

239
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,260
Since they have the high ground, we're at a disadvantage!

240
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,100
Can we get in contact with any of the squadrons in headquarters?

241
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,770
Have them open the gate from the inside.

242
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:10,600
Roger!

243
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,100
This is the 3rd Guards Battalion!

244
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,360
Central Headquarters Garrison, answer!

245
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,440
There are still dolls at the east gate...

246
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:18,860
What?

247
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,940
What are they saying?

248
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,360
Give me that.

249
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,070
I'm Gamelan from the Guards Battalion.

250
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,160
We're at the front gate.

251
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,910
Can you not open the gate to headquarters from the inside?

252
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,290
It's impossible!

253
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,000
There are dolls lurking about, so we can't open the gate!

254
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,540
Dolls?

255
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,170
What are you talking about?

256
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,430
What happened?!

257
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,680
What's going on?!

258
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,300
What?!

259
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,090
More enemies?!

260
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,320
What on earth is going on down there?

261
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,800
Oh?

262
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,930
Not bad, gramps.

263
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,940
Thanks. You saved me.

264
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:40,440
I didn't save you. I saved the young master's body.

265
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,190
If you say so.

266
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:45,950
Releasing a nasty aura from the young master's body...

267
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,820
Well, I couldn't have found you otherwise.

268
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:57,080
So, who's this guy who's left unscathed despite our combined efforts?

269
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,460
King Bradley.

270
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,970
Oh.

271
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,430
It's my first time seeing him with my own eyes.

272
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:20,980
So he's the one who ripped off my granddaughter's arm...!

273
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:41,720
Ever since that day passed,

274
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:41,720
Ano hi kara zutto

275
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,970
Nakanaito kimetekitakedo

276
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,970
I promised myself that I'd never cry.

277
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:51,520
But even while I hoarded up the pain,

278
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:51,520
Itami wo kasanetemo

279
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,630
there was something I couldn't forgive myself for.

280
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,630
Nanika wo yurusezu ni ita

281
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,070
I'll never be able

282
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,070
Mou modorenai

283
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,570
to return to those days.

284
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,570
Ikutsumo no hibi

285
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:07,660
I'm still powerless.

286
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:07,660
Boku wa mada nanimo dekizuni

287
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:12,910
I watch as the shards of memories disappear, one by one;

288
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:12,910
Kimi no ita kioku no kakera

289
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:18,780
memories of when you were still with me.

290
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:18,780
Mata hitotsu kieteyuku

291
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,800
I long to become

292
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,800
Kyou yori motto

293
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,550
stronger than I am now,

294
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,550
Tsuyoku naritai

295
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:29,690
so that my voice will eventually reach you.

296
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:29,690
Kono koe ga itsuka todokuyouni

297
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:32,060
If the wind happens to stop

298
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:32,060
Arukitsuzukete

299
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,770
in the midst of my long journey,

300
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,770
Kaze ga yandara

301
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:39,480
I'll look up at the sky in search of you.

302
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:39,480
Kimi wo sagashite sora miageruyo

303
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:46,820
Beyond the daybreak, a ray of light breaks free.

304
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:46,820
Yoake no saki ni hikari ga sasuyo

305
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:52,370
A rainbow spans across the sky.

306
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:52,370
Niji ga kakaruyo

307
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,840
When a man knows the enemy, and knows himself,

308
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:05,540
he realizes the end of the battle.

309
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,130
However, he will not die for nothing.

310
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,970
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

311
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:18,470
Episode 57, Eternal Leave.

312
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:18,490
Eternal Leave

313
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,270
Farewell, my lord.

314
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:26,070
I shall watch over you from the other side.
