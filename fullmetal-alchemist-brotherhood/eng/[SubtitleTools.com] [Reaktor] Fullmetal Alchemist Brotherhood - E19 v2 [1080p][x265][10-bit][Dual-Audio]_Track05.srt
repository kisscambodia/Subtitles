1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,810
Elizabeth! Hey!

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,220
Elizabeth!

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:17,200
Drawn by a landscape as white as snow,

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:17,200
Masshiro na keshiki ni ima sasowarete

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:23,750
I'm headed toward an unseen world.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:23,750
Boku wa yuku yo mada minu sekai e

7
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,690
I've been traveling while lost

8
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,690
Maigo no mama tabi shiteita

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,480
Under this gray sky.

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,470
Nezumiiro no sora no shita

11
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:41,570
Higawari no chizu ikutsumo no yume ga nijindeita

12
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:41,570
Every day with new maps, stained with my many dreams.

13
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,960
I wonder if someday,

14
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,960
Itsuka wa sa

15
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,000
Even with these tiny steps of mine,

16
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,000
Chippoke na boku no kono hohaba demo

17
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:54,080
I'll be able to travel beyond those clouds.

18
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:54,080
Ano kumo no mukou made yukeru kana

19
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,710
I put on a bold front.

20
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,710
Tsuyogatte

21
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,260
End up hurting myself.

22
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,260
Kizutsuita

23
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,340
I feel empty inside.

24
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,340
Kokoro sukashita youni

25
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,880
It's started to rain,

26
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,880
Furidashita

27
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,050
And the raindrops

28
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,050
Amatsubu tachi ga

29
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,270
Began to repeat their scattered reflections.

30
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,270
Ranhansha kurikaesu

31
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,140
These straight rays of light

32
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,140
Massugu na hikari ga

33
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,860
Kousa shite

34
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,860
Start to cross one another.

35
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,440
And without telling anyone where they're headed,

36
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,440
Yakusaki mo tsugenumama

37
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,730
Across the endless distances,

38
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,730
Doko made mo

39
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,320
They pass through all matter.

40
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,320
Tsukinukeru

41
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:25,150
I burn these faint afterimages onto my eyes.

42
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:25,150
Awai zanzou ryoume ni yakitsukete

43
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,070
Under this sky,

44
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,070
Kono sora no shita

45
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:30,900
Wherever I am,

46
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:30,900
Donna toko ni itemo

47
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,200
I should be able to reach

48
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,200
Todoku hazu nanda

49
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,010
The unseen world.

50
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,010
Mada minu sekai e

51
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,490
I'm not supposed to tell anyone this, but according to Barry,

52
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:52,410
the Colonel is trying to expose the people in the military involved in that Lab 5 place.

53
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,290
Research Laboratory 5...

54
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,170
Al...

55
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,300
I have to go.

56
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,760
I might find out something about
the person who killed Mr. Hughes.

57
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,220
Hey, hang on! What about the secret to your body?

58
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,390
I'll tell you when I get back.

59
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,730
What's up with that?!

60
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,190
Well, I'm off.

61
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,110
Make sure you come back.

62
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,190
Yes. I promise.

63
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,890
Death of the Undying

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,750
Done already?

65
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Can I eat you now?

66
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,350
Shut up, you're in the way!

67
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:53,680
Lieutenant!

68
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,160
Out of bullets? Out of bullets?

69
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,910
Then it's time for dinner!

70
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,760
Looks like I made it in time.

71
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,300
Colonel...

72
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,510
Why did you come?!

73
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,390
Despite whatever may have happened to us, if you had just ignored it, you could have escaped suspicion!

74
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,640
And yet, you came out here?!

75
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,980
Seriously, are you an idiot?!

76
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,980
Okay, okay. I'm an idiot.

77
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,820
What the hell was that guy...

78
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,160
Colonel! Our target is on the run!

79
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,160
Sergeant, pull out!

80
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,410
Don't leave a trace!

81
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,290
Hayate, you stay with the Sergeant!

82
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,460
Yes, sir!

83
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,550
Colonel.

84
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,630
What is it?

85
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,670
Thank you.

86
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,760
Save it for later. We're in the middle of an operation.

87
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,590
Yes, sir.

88
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:18,640
Get in!

89
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:19,690
Yes, sir.

90
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,690
This has something to do with Mr. Hughes, right?

91
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,030
Do you want to come?

92
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:32,490
Yes.

93
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,580
Don't lose sight of him!

94
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,750
I won't let him get away!

95
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,250
My soul keeps shaking...

96
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,000
It's telling me where he is!

97
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,930
I wonder if other monsters like that fat one are going to show up?

98
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,220
I don't know. What the hell was that?

99
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,520
I hit his vitals many times,
but it didn't seem to bother him at all.

100
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,390
Did he have a tattoo of Ouroboros?

101
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,940
Tattoo?

102
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,360
Oh, maybe that thing...

103
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,650
He had something on his tongue.

104
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:12,240
That's probably a homunculus.

105
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,240
That was close, idiot!

106
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,700
Wait, wait, wait! A homunculus?!

107
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,370
There's no way something like that could exist!

108
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,830
I met a homunculus by the name of Greed in the south.

109
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,210
And this is what he said.

110
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,420
"There's no way there's no way."

111
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,090
Homunculi have extraordinary regeneration abilities.

112
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,100
Greed had half of his head blown off, but he fixed himself right away.

113
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,650
But I guess that's hard to believe, huh...

114
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,150
We'll just have to believe you after seeing that thing.

115
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:54,610
You're not going to tell me he's still alive after being burnt to a crisp and falling from the top of the tower, are you?

116
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,620
Probably.

117
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,660
What is this... a nonsensical mutant all-around freak show?!

118
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:17,260
My body escaped into here.

119
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,390
Research Laboratory 3, huh?

120
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,310
Now we have a chance to blackmail the upper echelon.

121
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,810
That's sufficient for this operation.

122
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,060
We're withdrawing.

123
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,520
No, it's not!

124
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,190
No! Idiot!

125
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,360
This is bad, Colonel.

126
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,150
No, it's actually convenient.

127
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,450
What?

128
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,660
Outta the way!

129
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,660
I'm not interested in your meat!

130
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,670
Where are you, my meat?!

131
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,050
All personnel are to evacuate immediately!

132
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,260
C-Colonel!

133
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,260
The intruder is a vicious criminal.

134
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,510
Leave his capture to us.

135
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,100
The guards are to seal off all entrances!

136
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:03,640
Yes, sir!

137
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,240
That damn Barry... which way did he go?

138
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,160
We're splitting up.

139
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,330
Roger.

140
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,710
Looks like it's been quite some time since this place was abandoned.

141
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,510
Could it be... an experiment room?

142
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,930
If that were true, it doesn't seem any pleasant experiments were carried out here.

143
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,510
Oh my, what a coincidence.

144
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,980
I can't believe you stood me up.

145
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,190
You know, I was waiting for you.

146
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,570
I wanted to see you, Jean.

147
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,320
Solaris...

148
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,240
Why are you here?

149
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,790
Hey Havoc, she's got a tattoo of Ouroboros!

150
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,700
I just noticed that, myself!

151
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,000
Sorry for tricking you.

152
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,840
Well, I can see how you were tricked.

153
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,220
You like big breasts, don't you?

154
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,260
Yes! You bet I do!

155
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,640
...I do! ...I do! ...I do!

156
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,140
Did you tell her anything?

157
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,310
I didn't tell her anything related to my work!

158
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:37,150
Do you know Maes Hughes?

159
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,360
He was a handsome, smart man.

160
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,200
It's a pity I couldn't finish him off-

161
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,330
Get on your knees!

162
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,290
Tell me everything you know.

163
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,500
That's impossible.

164
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,420
You boys can't make me kneel-

165
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:07,390
As expected from the hero of Ishbal.

166
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,100
You're relentless.

167
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,150
H-Homunculus?!

168
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,310
Oh my, looks like you did your homework, Jean.

169
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:18,610
As a reward, I'll show you.

170
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,530
Do you see it?

171
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,950
It's a philosopher's stone.

172
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:31,710
Humans created with this stone as their core...

173
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,080
That's what we, homunculi, are.

174
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,000
You monsters!

175
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,920
How rude.

176
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,760
We have feelings and love for our parents.

177
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,510
We're...

178
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,510
...human.

179
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:54,520
If you're telling us your huge secret,
you must not be planning on letting us go alive.

180
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,520
Yes, unfortunately for you.

181
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,570
Too slow!

182
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,700
Oh my, you can't even make your fire now.

183
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,960
What do we do now?! At this rate, we'll get tortured to death!

184
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,130
No, it's actually convenient.

185
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,300
If there's a lot of water...

186
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:29,050
...I just have to decompose it to create hydrogen and oxygen!

187
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,160
Geez, just look at this thing...

188
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,540
I got it from my ex, too...

189
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:00,210
Damnit!

190
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,210
Colonel, could you give me a light?

191
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,340
I guess it's impossible.

192
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,840
What am I, a wet match?!

193
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,430
That woman definitely burned up.

194
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,020
How can you tell?

195
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,600
By the smell.

196
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,190
I'm used to the smell of burnt corpses.

197
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,650
From Ishbal?

198
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:24,030
But we can't take her regeneration ability lightly.

199
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,530
Stay alert.

200
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,530
Roger.

201
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,240
Havoc!

202
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,290
Havoc, hang in there!

203
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,130
It's no use.

204
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,460
You can't save him anymore.

205
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,510
No!

206
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,010
It's pointless!

207
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,430
It'll take more than that to kill me!

208
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,520
I can save him with this!

209
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,370
I'm going to use it to treat him.

210
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,370
Medical alchemy isn't my specialty,

211
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,080
but if I boost my ability with this stone...

212
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,880
It's not very gentlemanly of you to suddenly stick your hand into a lady's chest.

213
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,020
F-Führer President!

214
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,730
An intruder?

215
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,530
Yes, sir! The culprit who attacked the western district jail is inside!

216
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,620
Colonel Mustang is after him!

217
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,370
I think I'll lend him a hand.

218
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,500
We'll come with you, too, sir!

219
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,460
No.

220
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,330
I'll be fine on my own.

221
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,960
I thought I told you.

222
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,220
The philosopher's stone is my core.

223
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,350
I'm sorry.

224
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,980
You're a candidate for sacrifice,

225
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,310
but you're going to die here.

226
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,310
You bitch...

227
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:34,320
Why don't you die as you lay there, watching your man go cold?

228
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,870
Second Lieutenant Havoc...

229
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,330
Answer me... damnit...

230
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:46,380
I'm not going to allow you to die before me...

231
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,800
Havoc...

232
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,720
You sure took your time, lady.

233
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:04,770
Just look how rotten my body has become.

234
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,150
It's impossible to place a soul on a body that doesn't belong.

235
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:16,240
If separate souls and bodies can't be mixed,

236
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,830
then I, who am made of a human soul and an iron body...

237
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:28,080
That's right, there's no guarantee this body will last to the time we fulfill our goal...

238
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,630
Brother...

239
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,630
There you are, Miss Lust.

240
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:41,180
Number 66, why did you join forces with the Colonel?

241
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,600
Because it seemed like it'd be fun!

242
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,980
And also...

243
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,610
...I want to cut you up, more than anything!

244
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,520
What a troublesome man.

245
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,780
And the armor boy, too? What are you doing here?

246
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,910
What a loss.

247
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:04,700
That I have to kill two candidates for sacrifice in one night!

248
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,750
Sacrifice? Two?

249
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,710
Yes. You and someone else.

250
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:14,960
What are you blabbering on for, Miss Lust?!

251
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,690
I hate persistent guys.

252
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:34,820
Now, Lieutenant. I'll send you to the place where I sent your superior right away.

253
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,830
Wait...

254
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,210
You said two sacrifices in one night, right...

255
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,710
Don't tell me... you didn't...

256
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,630
Y...You bitch!!!

257
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,200
Finished?

258
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,310
You humans really are foolish, weak, pitiful beings.

259
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,270
Lieutenant, get up and run.

260
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,520
Do you want to die first?

261
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:03,280
I see... so you opened the gate.

262
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,830
It's a shame.

263
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,960
Forget candidate, you're a confirmed sacrifice.

264
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:19,550
Alphonse, leave me and run.

265
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,340
No.

266
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,470
Run!

267
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,470
No!

268
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,090
Save yourself, at least!

269
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,010
I said, no!!!

270
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,350
Seeing people die before my eyes...

271
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,100
I hate it! I'm tired of it!

272
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,190
I'm not going to let anyone die anymore! I'll protect you!

273
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:45,070
Well said, Alphonse Elric!

274
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,000
You finally got down on your knees.

275
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,310
Using flint as the starter, and magnifying it with
a transmutation circle made of your own blood...

276
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,690
How can you even move with that wound?!

277
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,600
I sealed it with fire!

278
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,770
Although I almost fainted a few times.

279
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,530
You said, "It'll take more than that to kill me", right?

280
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,290
Then I'll just keep killing you until you die!

281
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,670
Colonel!

282
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,830
I lost.

283
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:20,330
It's a shame, but it doesn't feel
too bad to be killed by a man like you.

284
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,340
With honest eyes with no hesitation.

285
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,630
I can't wait...

286
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,800
The days when those eyes will show anguish...

287
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,470
...are... close...

288
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:42,820
Colonel!

289
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,070
You were all right...

290
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,280
Please worry about yourself!

291
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:54,160
Alphonse, you have my gratitude for protecting my subordinate.

292
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,040
Forget that! We need a doctor!

293
00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:02,210
That's right... Please... hurry and have a doctor see Havoc...

294
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,600
He'll be all right... he'll be all right...

295
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,530
Hey... I'm back.

296
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,540
Idiot! Welcome back!

297
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,500
W-Well...

298
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:44,630
U-Umm... Where to start...

299
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,210
Umm...

300
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,890
It broke off!

301
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,430
Oh no! I can't fix this!

302
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:07,570
Dear me, I barely managed to survive...

303
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,900
...but in a form like this...

304
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,200
I wonder if someone can't fix me up...

305
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:18,490
Whoa! You were still alive?!

306
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,460
H-Hey... stop! What are you doing?!

307
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,290
I still haven't killed enough!

308
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:28,500
S... Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! W-Wait!

309
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,970
S-S-S-Stop!

310
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,460
No way...

311
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,630
Impossible...

312
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,560
Hohenheim!

313
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:37,380
I don't have to act tough, right?

314
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:37,380
Tsuyogaranakute iindane

315
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:44,180
The scribbling someone made...

316
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:44,180
Dareka ga kaitetta

317
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:49,980
On the wall, of a flower is swaying.

318
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:49,980
Kabe no rakugaki no hana ga yureru

319
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,560
Jibunrashisa nante dermo wakaranaiyo

320
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,560
No one knows their true selves.

321
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,860
Even though we both lose and gain

322
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,860
Nagai nagai michi no tochuu de

323
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,280
By embarking on this long, long path,

324
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,280
Nakushitari hirottari

325
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:08,950
And though there may be days loneliness strikes and makes us weep...

326
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:08,950
Kyuu ni samishikunatte naichau hi mo arukedo

327
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:16,460
Let's transform our tears and pains to stars.

328
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:16,460
Namida mo itami mo hoshi ni kaeyou

329
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:22,460
Let's light a candle to illuminate our tomorrow.

330
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:22,460
Ashita wo terasu akari wo tomosou

331
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,590
And we'll hold our small hands over the fire to create stardust,

332
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,590
Chiisana te kazashite futari de tsukurou

333
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:32,810
And an eternity that shines so brilliantly.

334
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:32,810
Hoshikuzu wo tsuyoku hikaru eien wo

335
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:38,190
Farewells may be unavoidable,

336
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:38,190
Sayonara itsuka wa kurukamoshirenai

337
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:44,110
Yet the seasons continue to change obliviously.

338
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:44,110
Kisetsu wa soredemo meguri megutteku

339
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,200
Even if I lose myself, I'll continue to walk...

340
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,200
Chiisaku mayottemo aruiteku

341
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,240
Kimi to aruiteku

342
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,240
Walk by your side.

343
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,540
That's the only thing I'd like to never change.

344
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,540
Sore dake wa kawaranaideiyoune

345
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:03,820
The truth revealed both of his emotions: joy, and unhappiness.

346
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:08,280
When the boy had to take a stand against the past he threw away,

347
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,290
what he had been hiding behind his resolve was exposed.

348
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,580
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

349
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:21,080
Father Before the Grave

350
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:21,080
Episode 20, Father Before the Grave.

351
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,970
It is possible to cry without tears.

352
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,470
If you're a human.
