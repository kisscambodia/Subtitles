1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:06,190
Drawn by a landscape as white as snow,

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:06,190
Masshiro na keshiki ni ima sasowarete

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,740
I'm headed toward an unseen world.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,740
Boku wa yuku yo mada minu sekai e

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,680
I've been traveling while lost

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,680
Maigo no mama tabi shiteita

7
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,470
Under this gray sky.

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,460
Nezumiiro no sora no shita

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,560
Every day with new maps, stained with my many dreams.

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,560
Higawari no chizu ikutsumo no yume ga nijindeita

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,950
I wonder if someday,

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,950
Itsuka wa sa

13
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,990
Even with these tiny steps of mine,

14
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,990
Chippoke na boku no kono hohaba demo

15
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:43,070
I'll be able to travel beyond those clouds.

16
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:43,070
Ano kumo no mukou made yukeru kana

17
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,700
I put on a bold front.

18
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,700
Tsuyogatte

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,250
End up hurting myself.

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,250
Kizutsuita

21
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,330
I feel empty inside.

22
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,330
Kokoro sukashita youni

23
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,870
It's started to rain,

24
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,870
Furidashita

25
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,040
And the raindrops

26
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,040
Amatsubu tachi ga

27
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,260
Began to repeat their scattered reflections.

28
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,260
Ranhansha kurikaesu

29
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,130
These straight rays of light

30
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,130
Massugu na hikari ga

31
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,850
Start to cross one another.

32
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,850
Kousa shite

33
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,430
And without telling anyone where they're headed,

34
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,430
Yakusaki mo tsugenumama

35
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,720
Across the endless distances,

36
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,720
Doko made mo

37
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,310
They pass through all matter.

38
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,310
Tsukinukeru

39
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:14,140
I burn these faint afterimages onto my eyes.

40
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:14,140
Awai zanzou ryoume ni yakitsukete

41
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,060
Under this sky,

42
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,060
Kono sora no shita

43
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,890
Wherever I am,

44
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,890
Donna toko ni itemo

45
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,190
I should be able to reach

46
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,190
Todoku hazu nanda

47
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:27,000
The unseen world.

48
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:27,000
Mada minu sekai e

49
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,360
That was so exhausting!

50
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,950
They were watching us the whole time, too.

51
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,240
Mr. Fu and Ran Fan, right?

52
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,160
Hey!

53
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,870
Where's the young master!?

54
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:50,330
I don't see him...

55
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,840
Could he have gone missing again?

56
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,840
Seriously... The instant I take my eyes off him...

57
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,680
Young master!

58
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,850
Where have you gone?!

59
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,850
I hope he hasn't collapsed somewhere like last time...

60
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,390
Good riddance.

61
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,180
Let's go.

62
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,400
Okay...

63
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,480
Young master! Where are you?!

64
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,540
There's something... odd about this country.

65
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,980
Footsteps of a
Comrade-in-Arms

66
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,010
It's me. I came to visit.

67
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,310
Good work.

68
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,520
From the Colonel.

69
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,520
Yo, it's the cigarette kid!

70
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,150
How are you doing? Were you even able to beat him once?

71
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,440
Not a chance.

72
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,780
This game is pretty boring, too.

73
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,450
Hey, I can go cut people up if it's just at night, right?

74
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,870
Of course not!

75
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,000
Then, could you at least... bring that Hawkeye lady?

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,580
Yeah, I'll mention it to her.

77
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:19,670
How much longer do I have to watch over this guy?

78
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,170
What did the Colonel say?

79
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,010
"Sorry for putting you in charge of such a dangerous task."

80
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,560
"Don't worry about military duty, though."

81
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,770
"I've marked you down as absent due to illness."

82
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:38,230
"However, you're as good as dead if a civilian
or someone from the military besides us finds you."

83
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,270
...is what he said.

84
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,110
Any good news?

85
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:45,280
Yup.

86
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,700
Huh? What is it?

87
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,660
I got a girlfriend!

88
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,750
She really helped me out when I was struggling with the transfer and all.

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,080
She's such a babe, too!

90
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,170
Hey, do you think I'd enjoy cutting her up?

91
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,260
Just go home already...

92
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,050
Oh my.

93
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,510
What's wrong with him?

94
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,470
Hey, are you all right?

95
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,720
Is he okay?

96
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,600
F-Food...

97
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,760
He's completely out of it.

98
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,640
Where's he from?

99
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,520
What? You came from Xing?

100
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,020
That's so far...

101
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,400
By the way, where's your certificate of entry?

102
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,490
Make way! Make way!

103
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,530
Illegal entrant coming through!

104
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,780
Young master! Where are you?!

105
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,290
He's passed out somewhere... I just know he has!

106
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,000
Well, let's go say hi to the military first.

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,040
Let's.

108
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:44,590
Then... I think I'll go visit Mr. Hughes' place first.

109
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,090
I can't wait to see Miss Gracia and Elicia, either.

110
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,470
Okay.

111
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,390
We'll head over there afterwards.

112
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,850
Well, see you then.

113
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:02,230
I wonder if Lt. Colonel Hughes uncovered
more information about the stone for us since then.

114
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,110
Well, the Führer President warned him to stay out of it, too.

115
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,280
Let's give him the information we obtained, first.

116
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,780
Homunculus...

117
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,910
Yeah.

118
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,000
The Lt. Colonel should be at the military chambers...

119
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,540
Over there!

120
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:39,730
Sheska?

121
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:40,980
Sheska!

122
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,770
Yes?

123
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,110
You have the key to that room, right?

124
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,780
Yes, I do.

125
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,320
Oh... Room 3, you mean?

126
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,700
I've kind of made a mess in there...

127
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,200
Don't worry about it. I just need to grab some documents.

128
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,040
I'm telling you, it's not all right.

129
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,210
I'll clean it up right away, so please give me a moment!

130
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,050
Okay. I'll come get it later, so please finish by then.

131
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:05,960
Y-Yes, ma'am!

132
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,060
Umm... Colonel?

133
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,900
Colonel Mustang.

134
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,120
How many minutes was I asleep?

135
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,660
I'd say about ten.

136
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,790
I don't have much time before the army council.

137
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:47,920
Excuse my unsolicited advice, but perhaps
you should rest instead of straining yourself?

138
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,880
Yeah, I'll come again.

139
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,470
Was that Colonel Mustang?

140
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,480
G-Good morning, Captain Focker!

141
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,350
Morning, Sheska.

142
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,690
But why was the Colonel here?

143
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,110
W-Well... you see...

144
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,690
The door to the archives is open, too.

145
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,110
I'm sorry! The truth is, well...

146
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,450
Let me guess, the colonel railroaded through, right?

147
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,910
I'll keep it a secret.

148
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,200
Thank you so much!

149
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,120
But I wonder what he was looking up?

150
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,210
Any idea?

151
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,590
I don't know the details either,

152
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,970
but he asked me whether there were
any documents concerning Research Laboratory 5.

153
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,720
That, and the murder of Brigadier General Hughes...

154
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:44,480
It's thanks to the Brigadier General that I got a job here.

155
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,650
Ah, that's right.

156
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,150
Well, there's a lot of work to do today as always.

157
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,240
I'm counting on you.

158
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:56,820
Yes, sir.

159
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,970
Morning, Sheska.

160
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,970
Yes? Huh?

161
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,640
What?

162
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,410
Hello.

163
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,120
Did you perhaps lose some weight?

164
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,920
I might have.

165
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,340
You were injured?

166
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,260
Just some trouble down south.

167
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,720
It's just a scratch.

168
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,640
I see.

169
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,430
By the way, I met the Elric Brothers while I was down there.

170
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,810
A coincidence. They were meeting their master, who lives in Dublith.

171
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,310
Major.

172
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,190
Yes?

173
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,440
Have you told them about Hughes' death?

174
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,950
No, I couldn't bring myself to tell them.

175
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,450
They'll find out sooner or later.

176
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,280
I know that, sir.

177
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,160
Research Laboratory 5 and the philosopher's stones.

178
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,960
The ingredients to the stones are live humans.

179
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,750
He was such an accommodating guy.

180
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:38,720
He probably stuck his nose into what the Elric Brothers were researching and uncovered something he shouldn't have.

181
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,590
Is that why you won't tell them?

182
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:49,060
If they find out Hughes died because he got involved with them, they'd be devastated...

183
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,480
You're too kind.

184
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,610
And you know too much.

185
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,990
I'm almost there.

186
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,990
Please be careful.

187
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,490
No one knows who could be listening.

188
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,250
I'll be going on ahead.

189
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,420
Huh? Lieutenant Hawkeye!

190
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,340
Ah, it's been a while.

191
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,760
If you're here, that means...

192
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,680
Sorry to make you wait.

193
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,270
I knew it...

194
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,690
Oh, Fullmetal.

195
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,690
Why the hell are you here, Colonel?

196
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,320
I was transferred to Central effective last month.

197
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,690
And what about you? What brings you here?

198
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,870
Just collecting some information.

199
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,660
We were also thinking about going to say hi to Lt. Colonel Hughes.

200
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,290
How's he doing?

201
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,170
He's no longer here.

202
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,290
Huh?

203
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,920
He decided to retire to the country.

204
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:03,180
He's going to take over the family business along with his wife and daughter.

205
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,260
So he's not here.

206
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,850
Oh... that's too bad.

207
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,680
We were looking forward to seeing him, too...

208
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,270
Fullmetal.

209
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,070
Don't jump the gun and do anything reckless.

210
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,570
Sure.

211
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,130
Treating them like children only at a time like this?

212
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,630
They don't need to know right now.

213
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:43,970
It's better if there are fewer obstacles for those brothers to move forward.

214
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,510
But they'll find out eventually.

215
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:55,690
I don't have the right to call
Major Armstrong soft-hearted, either.

216
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,900
Soft-hearted?

217
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,320
Don't you mean cruel?

218
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,820
So the Lt. Colonel isn't around, huh...

219
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,320
Oh, I almost forgot, Brother.

220
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,240
We have to let Winry know.

221
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,040
She's headed for his home.

222
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,500
You're right.

223
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,500
Second Lieutenant Ross!

224
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,170
It's been a while, you two.

225
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,760
What's the hurry?

226
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,260
We heard about Lt. Colonel Hughes, so...

227
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,600
I see...

228
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,510
It's hard, isn't it?

229
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,270
There was so much I wanted to say to him, too...

230
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,560
I wish we had a chance to have a proper farewell with him.

231
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,730
No one contacted you about it, huh?

232
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,770
Don't worry.

233
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:42,110
The army gave him a proper farewell.

234
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,320
Really? That's nice of you guys.

235
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,950
Of course.

236
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:53,700
Also, you may have heard this already, but he was specially promoted two ranks to the rank of Brigadier General.

237
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,710
Specially promoted two ranks?

238
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,630
He was specially promoted for retiring to the country?

239
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,220
Second Lieutenant Ross!

240
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,070
Here you go.

241
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,440
Thanks.

242
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,490
You can't be serious! Why was he...

243
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,580
Why?!

244
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,920
Brother!

245
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,890
Brigadier General Hughes was murdered by someone soon after you were released from the hospital.

246
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,100
They haven't caught the perpetrator yet.

247
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,440
It's my fault...

248
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,520
I dragged him into this! Lt. Colonel Hughes!

249
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,250
Well, careful out there.

250
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,210
Be sure to drop by if you ever come to Central again.

251
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:25,300
Oh, Alphonse, you can't eat with that armor on, can you?

252
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,630
You guys probably haven't booked a place to stay at yet, right?

253
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,300
If so, stay at my place.

254
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,400
Papa!

255
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,550
What are you going to do?

256
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,920
I'm going to tell them everything.

257
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,970
You head back.

258
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,510
I'm the only one who needs to face them.

259
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,560
It's not just your problem.

260
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,270
It concerns both of us.

261
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,940
So I'm going, too.

262
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,940
Hey, Al.

263
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,730
What if-

264
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:32,400
We chose to get our bodies back no matter what,

265
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,790
but if people end up dying because of it, I'd rather not.

266
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,710
Winry just came by, too...

267
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,210
We know.

268
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:52,920
Winry.

269
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:03,940
There's something I need to tell you, Miss Gracia.

270
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,140
Is that okay?

271
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,440
Something to tell me?

272
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,310
Yes.

273
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,020
And to Winry, too.

274
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,740
So my husband uncovered something about these philosopher's stones...

275
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:25,500
And his death is the murderers' way of saying "don't meddle in our affairs"?

276
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,590
We basically dragged him in.

277
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,750
I'm so sorry.

278
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,760
I'm terribly sorry...

279
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,520
If he died while trying to help someone, then that's just like him.

280
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:50,770
He's always been a meddling, accommodating kind of guy, and he'd always end up losing things due to his kindness.

281
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,610
But I don't think he's ever regretted it.

282
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,370
Even till the moment of his death.

283
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,370
We're...

284
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,960
Don't tell me you're going to give up.

285
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:13,210
If you two give up here, it'd mean
my husband's death was completely meaningless.

286
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:20,140
Even if it's impossible with the philosopher's stones, there may be other ways, right?

287
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,850
Miss Gracia...

288
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,940
Move forward on the path you're content with.

289
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,200
Mama...

290
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,200
Please don't cry, Mama...

291
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,930
You're in there, right, Winry?

292
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,890
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

293
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,770
The dining hall's going to close soon.

294
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,730
Okay...

295
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,900
You won't be able to function without food.

296
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,240
Yeah...

297
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,320
Well, I'm heading back to my room.

298
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,500
Apple pie?

299
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,880
I practiced making it a few times since then.

300
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,250
I don't mean to brag, but I've gotten really good at it.

301
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,760
Well, it's nowhere near as good as Miss Gracia's, though...

302
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,390
Someday...

303
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:31,020
I wanted Mr. Hughes to try it.

304
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:53,000
The Colonel is digging around
for information about Hughes' death?

305
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,120
Yeah.

306
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,500
I wonder if he's discovered anything?

307
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,670
Maybe.

308
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,010
What do we do?

309
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:06,510
We moved him to Central to keep an eye on him...

310
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,720
Can't he just behave?

311
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,350
He's a precious candidate for sacrifice.

312
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,350
You haven't gotten any information out of your boyfriend?

313
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,230
Nothing.

314
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,360
I can't even tell if he's foolish or able.

315
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,190
I'll go hunt for some information again.

316
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,200
We're going, Gluttony.

317
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:32,120
Geez, Gluttony! Don't leave this place a mess!

318
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,330
Seriously...

319
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,500
Hey, Lust?

320
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,880
We just need the Flame Alchemist to behave, right?

321
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,130
That's right.

322
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,380
Are you up for taking another measure?

323
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,890
Got something on your mind?

324
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,890
The best way to shut up an annoying dog is to give him some food.

325
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,820
Second Lieutenant Maria Ross.

326
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,240
I'm Henry Douglas from military police headquarters.

327
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:07,860
Can I help you?

328
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,740
You're coming with me.

329
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,120
Your sidearm.

330
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,580
Care to explain?

331
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:23,210
Your name has been called as a
material witness in the murder of Maes Hughes.

332
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,670
That's impossible!

333
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,680
You can explain yourself later.

334
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,180
Come with me.

335
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,930
Second Lieutenant Maria Ross is denying all charges.

336
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,100
Collect all data concerning her.

337
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,270
Make it quick.

338
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,820
However, do it in strict secrecy.

339
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,110
Yes, sir!

340
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,080
Hey lady, could you wrap up these flowers for me?

341
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,330
Oh my, are you going on a date? You lady-killer!

342
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,350
Did I make you wait, Solaris?

343
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,100
No, I just got here.

344
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,440
I've been dying to see you, Jean.

345
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,730
I'm looking forward to hearing your interesting stories again.

346
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:37,420
I don't have to act tough, right?

347
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:37,420
Tsuyogaranakute iindane

348
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:44,220
Dareka ga kaitetta

349
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:44,220
The scribbling someone made...

350
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:50,020
On the wall, of a flower is swaying.

351
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:50,020
Kabe no rakugaki no hana ga yureru

352
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:55,600
No one knows their true selves.

353
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:55,600
Jibunrashisa nante dermo wakaranaiyo

354
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,900
Even though we both lose and gain

355
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,900
Nagai nagai michi no tochuu de

356
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,320
By embarking on this long, long path,

357
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,320
Nakushitari hirottari

358
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:08,990
And though there may be days loneliness strikes and makes us weep...

359
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:08,990
Kyuu ni samishikunatte naichau hi mo arukedo

360
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:16,500
Namida mo itami mo hoshi ni kaeyou

361
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:16,500
Let's transform our tears and pains to stars.

362
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Let's light a candle to illuminate our tomorrow.

363
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Ashita wo terasu akari wo tomosou

364
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:27,630
And we'll hold our small hands over the fire to create stardust,

365
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:27,630
Chiisana te kazashite futari de tsukurou

366
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:32,850
And an eternity that shines so brilliantly.

367
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:32,850
Hoshikuzu wo tsuyoku hikaru eien wo

368
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:38,230
Farewells may be unavoidable,

369
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:38,230
Sayonara itsuka wa kurukamoshirenai

370
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:44,150
Yet the seasons continue to change obliviously.

371
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:44,150
Kisetsu wa soredemo meguri megutteku

372
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,240
Chiisaku mayottemo aruiteku

373
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,240
Even if I lose myself, I'll continue to walk...

374
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,280
Walk by your side.

375
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,280
Kimi to aruiteku

376
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,580
That's the only thing I'd like to never change.

377
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,580
Sore dake wa kawaranaideiyoune

378
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,770
The sacrificial lamb is engulfed in the flames of hatred...

379
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:07,530
...and leaves the boy with feelings of hate and regret.

380
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,530
And the man reaches out to the darkness.

381
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,790
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

382
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,790
Cold Flame

383
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,790
Episode 17, Cold Flame.

384
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:25,840
All is playing into the hands of the unknown.
