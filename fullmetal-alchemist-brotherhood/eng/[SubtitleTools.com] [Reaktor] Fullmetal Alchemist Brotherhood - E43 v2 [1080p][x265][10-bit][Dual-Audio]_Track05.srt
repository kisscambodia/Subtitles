1
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,910
Where are you, Sir Kimblee?!

2
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,770
This is far from what you promised!

3
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,500
You said your soldiers in Briggs would betray the others if we were to carry the attack to the fort!

4
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,800
Cease fire!

5
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,040
That was a crushing victory.

6
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,930
Yeah.

7
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,310
So this...

8
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,000
...is the bloody crest.

9
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:20,510
We sigh whenever we're about to come to a standstill

10
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:20,510
Owarinaki tabi no tochuu tachidomarisouna toki

11
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:26,770
While moving on this endless journey.

12
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:26,770
Fukai tameiki kobosu bokura wa

13
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:34,490
Everytime we lunge for it, it escapes and flies off.

14
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:34,490
Tsukamikaketewa mata hanareteitta

15
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:41,910
But now, there's nothing to be afraid of

16
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:41,910
Demo ima wa mou nanimo osoreru koto wa nai

17
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:49,830
The powerful ties that bind our hearts

18
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:49,830
Kokoro wo tsunagu tsuyoi kizuna wa

19
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:55,300
Will never come loose.

20
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:55,300
Keshite hodoke wa shinai sa

21
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:05,020
After a lifetime of searching, we finally arrived

22
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:05,020
Sagashitsuzukete tadoritsuita

23
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:10,810
Here, where the period lies.

24
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:10,810
Kono basho de piriodo ni

25
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:20,110
Let's change all our sorrow and rage to power.

26
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:20,110
Kanashimi ikari chikara ni kaete

27
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:25,040
Destiny is right within our reach.

28
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:25,040
Unmei wa sugu soba ni

29
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,090
So I'm saying...

30
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,170
...you're supposed to read the veins of the dragon while performing Eastern Alchemy!

31
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,800
And I'm saying...

32
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,550
...I don't understand how!

33
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,010
You're supposed to sharpen your senses!

34
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,180
Ready, go!

35
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,470
See? I sense it!

36
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,060
I can't do that!

37
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,440
Yes, you can!

38
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,270
Teach me the theories behind it!

39
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,610
Things are real rowdy in there.

40
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,150
I don't get it!

41
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,530
Sorry for having to ask you to hide us here.

42
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,990
Hey, don't worry about it.

43
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,950
We're benefiting as well.

44
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,530
Not the hair!

45
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,660
Now the kids have someone new to play with.

46
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,920
Let Zampano know that we're going up to the mountains to collect firewood.

47
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,050
Sure.

48
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,920
Damn it!

49
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,220
What a nightmare!

50
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,970
Where the hell is Zampano?! Everyone else is working!

51
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,020
Yo!

52
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,440
This way.

53
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,690
Follow me.

54
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,450
I'm counting on you, Zampano.

55
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,470
Bite of the Ant

56
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,960
So, you found out about Selim.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,750
Yes.

58
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,750
And my identity, as well.

59
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,050
Yes.

60
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,470
How do you feel as a citizen of a country...

61
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,680
...to know that your leader and his son are both Homunculi?

62
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:18,820
I believe it's a very sad thing for a family member you're supposed to trust to be fabricated.

63
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,200
It's almost like you're playing house.

64
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,320
All the while pretending to be human, creatures you deem as fools.

65
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:31,330
As you say, he's my "son" given to me by my handlers.

66
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:35,370
My rank of Führer President, along with my men and everything else, was also given to me.

67
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,090
Rather than "house", I'd say it's more accurate to say we're playing "politics".

68
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,090
However, I picked my bride myself.

69
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,720
Is the tea still not ready?

70
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,640
P-Pardon me.

71
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,770
Delicious.

72
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:10,080
Wow, so you used to be one of the head honchos of that Research Laboratory 5.

73
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,330
I wouldn't say that. I just had a couple of people working under me.

74
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,460
I wonder how they're doing now...

75
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,670
Hey!

76
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,340
Who might that be?

77
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,760
He's a vagrant I met this morning.

78
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,560
He wanted to have you see him, Doctor-

79
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,470
That's enough, Zampano.

80
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,390
The shitty acting ends here.

81
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,860
Why hello, Doctor.

82
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,940
What might you be doing here?

83
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:52,620
You're being too optimistic if you think roaches like you can outwit us.

84
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,620
What the hell is this?!

85
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,620
Zampano!

86
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,420
The shitty acting ends here, right?!

87
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,220
Our goal from the start was to lure you here!

88
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,050
Knowing how much of a nasty guy you are,

89
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,520
I figured you'd come and hunt me yourself if you knew I was alive!

90
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,810
What can three pieces of trash like you do?!

91
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,480
No matter how many you've got on your side,
you're nothing but trash in the end-

92
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,820
They work like landmines.

93
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,910
Alchemy evolves every day!

94
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,870
There's no way alchemy like that can exist-

95
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,580
Dammit!

96
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,130
If they're mines...

97
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:46,300
...all I have to do is trace your footsteps!

98
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,130
How can this be?!

99
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,970
They were made to only react to Homunculi!

100
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:00,390
You can't tell where they are and what awaits you because of all the snow.

101
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:01,940
So, tell me.

102
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,980
How does it feel to be ridiculed by people
you've been looking down on as trash and scum?

103
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,410
He's being fooled, all right.

104
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,780
It's just remote alchemy.

105
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,950
You bastards!

106
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,330
You scum should obey our commands, just as you were meant to!

107
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:27,670
You're nothing but trash! Don't get too cocky!

108
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,770
Doctor!

109
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,360
That was close.

110
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,740
Th-Thanks.

111
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:58,450
Grr. You're pretty fast for a fatass.

112
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,250
Don't underestimate trash!

113
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,750
You little shit!!

114
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,920
Such weak attacks can hardly pierce my skin!

115
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,430
Is that so?

116
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,260
Then what about this ?!

117
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,900
Did he do it?!

118
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,740
Got you now!

119
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,870
Doctor!

120
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,540
Whoa, don't move.

121
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,460
If you do, I'll snap him in half.

122
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,960
Now...

123
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,380
...you're in for some punishment.

124
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,710
Didn't I warn you, Doctor?

125
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,760
By saying I'll destroy an entire village if you were to do something unnecessary?

126
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,340
I won't let you!

127
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,970
You're still going to resist?

128
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,390
Man, you're dumb.

129
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,740
Okay, I'll destroy those slums over there.

130
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,320
Stop!

131
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,200
But simply destroying them is no fun.

132
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,710
Perhaps I'll bring a few back to Central and make a philosopher's stone out of them.

133
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,210
You filth!

134
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,130
You're still making those things over at Central?!

135
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,500
Release the researchers...

136
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,710
Release my men!

137
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,210
Huh?

138
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,800
That's impossible.

139
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,300
Because you see, we've already turned all of them into philosopher's stones.

140
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,020
E-Even my men?!

141
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,150
Oh? Guess I forgot to tell you, huh?

142
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:53,940
But Doctor, you shouldn't have any reason to weep now , after all this time.

143
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,820
Since you've made so many philosopher's stones in the past.

144
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,740
Using human lives.

145
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,500
You're right.

146
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:15,590
I've made many philosopher's stones, sacrificing the lives of many people.

147
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,390
I am more familiar with the ways of making a
philosopher's stone than anyone else in this country.

148
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,720
Knowing how to make one...

149
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,350
...also means I know how to destroy them!!

150
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,460
What on earth is that?!

151
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,590
It's coming from the hill where the doctor and the others are!

152
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,190
Oww! Oww!

153
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,190
Oww! Oww! Ow! Ow!

154
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,320
No...

155
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,360
It hurts!

156
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,400
This is...

157
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,950
No...

158
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:30,580
This-

159
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,330
This can't be...

160
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,830
I'm Envy...

161
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:39,300
There's no way I could be defeated by you inferior beings...

162
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,300
No...

163
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,760
Even the chimeras...

164
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,350
Don't look at me...

165
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,100
D-Don't look at-

166
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,350
Don't look down on me, humans!!!

167
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,520
Don't look at me, you insects...

168
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,900
Little shits...

169
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,280
Don't... look...

170
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,570
We were being manipulated by something like this ?

171
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,620
We won, Marcoh.

172
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,260
They're back!

173
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,300
Doctor Marcoh! What's with that wound?!

174
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,180
What's that ?

175
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:40,110
Wow, so you guys were doing some amazing things without us knowing.

176
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,320
This is what happens when you disobey us humans!

177
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:49,830
Why did you do something so reckless, Doctor Marcoh?

178
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,580
All my life, I've been doing everything as ordered.

179
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:57,790
But this was the one thing I wanted to settle myself.

180
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:01,130
Thinking on my own... Making a decision on my own...

181
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,590
Just like your parents did things.

182
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:10,100
But please, try not to be so reckless.

183
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,970
Okay.

184
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,100
Oww!!

185
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,560
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

186
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,770
Sir Yoki?

187
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,190
H-Help me...

188
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,700
I've taken over this guy's body!

189
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,740
Stop!

190
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,410
You monster!

191
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,490
M-My body isn't listening to me!

192
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,620
No use putting up a fight!

193
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,370
Now, you trash!

194
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,250
If you want to help this guy...

195
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,080
Nah, you can do whatever you want with him.

196
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,960
He's not really our friend, anyway.

197
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:45,300
It's been a short while, Sir Yoki...

198
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,260
I'll never forget you!

199
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,050
Master Scar!

200
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,260
You're  on my side though, right?!

201
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:53,850
Right?!

202
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,850
Don't look away, dammit!!

203
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,520
I believed in you, Master!

204
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,480
W-What? I thought this guy was your friend!

205
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,940
I believed in you!

206
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,780
Quit putting up a useless fight, Envy!

207
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,280
At this point, we don't exactly care about our actions.

208
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,780
If you're going to get in our way,
we'll destroy you along with that man!

209
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,660
Dammit...

210
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,040
He came off.

211
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,960
Really?

212
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,620
Nice act.

213
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:24,380
I-I'm not very good at bluffs...

214
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,760
Damn you all!

215
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,840
None of you are my friends!

216
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,800
Our friendship is over!

217
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,140
I have nothing to do with you anymore!

218
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,390
Damn...

219
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,520
So, it's about time you tell us what you guys are up to.

220
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,980
Like I'll tell you.

221
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,570
What did you say?!

222
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,230
Spill it!

223
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,900
Spill the beans, you insect!

224
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,650
Keep it up!

225
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,610
Show him who's boss, Zampano!

226
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,580
If I tell you, I'll just be killed later!

227
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,620
Why would I tell you, idiots?

228
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,870
You son of a...

229
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:02,080
Oh yeah, where's the Fullmetal runt?

230
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,330
Brother?

231
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,460
He should be in Briggs right now.

232
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,710
Oh?

233
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,090
Last I heard, he was missing.

234
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,010
What?!

235
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,010
What do you mean?!

236
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,010
Tell me more!

237
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:17,680
I heard a mine collapsed in Baschool.

238
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,390
I wonder if he's alive...

239
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,560
No way...

240
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,440
That can't be true.

241
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,610
So, what should we do?

242
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,200
Should we head back to Baschool?

243
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,450
No.

244
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,490
In a situation like this...

245
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:42,370
...Brother would definitely believe in the safety of the other team and keep moving forward.

246
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,750
So I want to do the same.

247
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,260
Hope is not lost.

248
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,840
I'm going to split off for a bit.

249
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,760
I've been thinking about it for a little while now.

250
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,930
Instead of simply detesting this country for denying Ishbal...

251
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,690
...I'm going to work to change it.

252
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,400
And for that, I need your help as well, Marcoh.

253
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,990
Sure.

254
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,030
I'll go with you.

255
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,780
To change this country...

256
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,410
The thing is, there's a city I want to visit, as well.

257
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,040
Where?

258
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,870
Lior.

259
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,670
If my predictions are correct, that tunnel should be there, too.

260
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:32,170
May, take this thing and return to your country.

261
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:32,170
So I'm thinking it'll be fastest for us to just destroy that.

262
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,430
Then, we'll be able to buy time.

263
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,050
Hey, Master!

264
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,470
It's the wreck of an immortal homunculus.

265
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,720
With the extra time, we can solve the structure of the new transmutation circle.

266
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,220
With this, your clan may be saved.

267
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:43,480
So, this "new transmutation circle" is the thing we discovered the other day, right?

268
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,230
B-But if I go back, who'll be here to help you with Eastern Alchemy-

269
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,060
Yup, that's the one.

270
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,810
Is this really the time to be worrying about another country?!

271
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,190
Did you come to this country with a resolve that weak?

272
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,730
If your clan happens to lose its struggle for power,

273
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,490
what are you going to tell the people who placed their fate in your hands?

274
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:58,490
"I failed because I was too busy helping people from another country"?!

275
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:01,950
Go.

276
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,960
We, the citizens of this country, will take care of it ourselves.

277
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,220
Thank you... so much!

278
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,730
Take care, May.

279
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:34,570
Once we settle things here, I'll visit you to learn more about Eastern Alchemy.

280
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,280
Sir Al...

281
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,070
Sir Al!

282
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,530
I... I...

283
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:50,290
Thank you so much, everyone!

284
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,300
Good bye!

285
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,880
Take care!

286
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,050
She's gone...

287
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:01,760
Yeah.

288
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,270
Well then, we should get going, as well.

289
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:04,890
Right.

290
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,780
Mr. Greed...

291
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,210
No luck.

292
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,550
Apparently, Izumi Curtis is out on vacation with her husband, and no one knows when they'll be back.

293
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,760
Guess there's not much we can do.

294
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:43,220
We should head back and report this to Führer President Bradley for now.

295
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,520
Bradley?!

296
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,480
You're coming with me, Greed.

297
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,110
Call someone to take over.

298
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,070
Good idea.

299
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,110
I might be able to see Mr. Greed if I follow them...

300
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:03,870
But...

301
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,430
Umm...

302
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:29,020
Would you mind moving your foot, Sister?

303
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,100
You are to address me as "Major General" here!

304
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,110
Aye, ma'am!

305
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,860
You've got a cowardly face on as always, I see.

306
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,820
I heard the battle with Drachma ended with your crushing victory.

307
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,570
Of course!

308
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:47,950
But wouldn't that just speed up the completion of the Nationwide Transmutation Circle?

309
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,000
It doesn't matter.

310
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,620
What we must protect right now is the safety of the country itself.

311
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,380
If there stands an enemy who threatens that very peace...

312
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:01,090
...our job is to deliver an overwhelming defeat of perfection!

313
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:04,260
Oh dear... why must you act so fierce?

314
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,010
At this rate, you'll never find someone to marry-

315
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,100
You just lack the fighting spirit!

316
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,020
You laggard!

317
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,810
Being with you makes me feel cowardly as well!

318
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,230
There you are, Major General.

319
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,820
He's your brother, I take it?

320
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,700
I don't even want to think of him as my brother.

321
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,330
He's a coward who ran away from Ishbal.

322
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,790
Follow me.

323
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,700
There's something I'd like to show you.

324
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,590
Are you aware of the three laws state alchemists are forbidden to disobey?

325
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,920
If I recall...

326
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,550
"Do not oppose the military."

327
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,880
"Do not make gold."

328
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,430
And "Do not create humans."

329
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,600
Precisely.

330
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,560
The first law is self-explanatory.

331
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,600
The second law is put in place to avoid economic turmoil.

332
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,400
Then what about the third?

333
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:01,610
Why does the nation forbid alchemists from creating humans?

334
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,610
I assume it's because of the moral and ethical implications.

335
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:10,450
Even among alchemists, I hear the act is tacitly forbidden as a blasphemy to God.

336
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,330
You're wrong there.

337
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:19,500
What is and is not ethical changes with time and also depends on whom you ask.

338
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,590
That is not the reason.

339
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:31,260
It is to prevent an individual from creating a powerful army of their own, Major General.

340
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:49,490
The promise we never made

341
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:49,490
Kawashita hazu no nai yakasoku ga

342
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,280
yet again

343
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,280
Kyou mo

344
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:55,120
tries to snatch our future away from us.

345
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:55,120
Bokura no mirai wo ubaou to suru

346
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:00,710
Why is it that we can't rejoice

347
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:00,710
Hoshigatteita mono wo te ni shitemo

348
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,710
straight from the heart

349
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,710
Sunao ni

350
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:06,670
when we obtain something we've always been after?

351
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:06,670
Umaku waraenai nowa nazedarou

352
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:12,390
The overflowing tears aren't from feebleness or remorse.

353
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:12,390
Afureru namida wo yowasa ya koukai ja nai

354
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:17,180
They're fragments born from agony.

355
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:17,180
Itami ga unda kakera de

356
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:22,230
Of all the moments and destinies,

357
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:22,230
Donna shunkan datte unmei datte

358
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:30,990
I realized there's one absolute certainty.

359
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:30,990
Hitotsu dake tashika na mono ga aru to shitta

360
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,530
Even if things get tough and I'm at my limit

361
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,530
Genkai datte konnan datte

362
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:37,540
Akirametakunaiyo

363
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:37,540
I refuse to give up.

364
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:42,420
Please, don't let go.

365
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:42,420
Konomama hanasanaide

366
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:50,260
I can feel the warmth of your right hand

367
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:50,260
Kataku nigirishimeta kimi no migite no nukumori

368
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,930
where it's tightly joined with my left.

369
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,930
Koko ni arukara

370
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,570
This place is in ruins...

371
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:07,280
Is there really a place to eat around here?

372
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,530
Let's see... I know it was around here somewhere...

373
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,820
Rose!

374
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,990
How have you been?!

375
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,450
I should be asking you the same thing, Al!

376
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,580
What, you're still on a journey?

377
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,790
Oh, you know her?

378
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,080
Yeah, something like that.

379
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,090
Al, where's Ed?

380
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,340
He's not with you?

381
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,380
B-Brother isn't with us today.

382
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,720
Oh... that's too bad.

383
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,390
I really wanted to see him.

384
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,600
What's this?

385
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,180
Wh-What?!

386
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,690
No, I was just pondering the meaning behind that mysterious look on your face.

387
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,400
Quit saying weird things!

388
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,230
Hey, Rose!

389
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,150
I finished washing the pots!

390
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,440
Is there anything else for me to-

391
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,080
Reunion. Revival. Resolve.

392
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,790
The time has come to set the soul afire.

393
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:07,670
As long as they live, humans continue to move forward.

394
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:11,170
No matter how thorny the path may be.

395
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,390
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

396
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:20,890
Episode 44, Revving at Full Throttle.

397
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:20,910
Revving at Full Throttle

398
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,020
Awaken, human.

399
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,860
Now is the beginning.
