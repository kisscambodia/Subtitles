1
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:23,460
We sigh whenever we're about to come to a standstill

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:23,460
Owarinaki tabi no tochuu tachidomarisouna toki

3
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,710
While moving on this endless journey.

4
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,710
Fukai tameiki kobosu bokura wa

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,430
Everytime we lunge for it, it escapes and flies off.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,430
Tsukamikaketewa mata hanareteitta

7
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,850
But now, there's nothing to be afraid of

8
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,850
Demo ima wa mou nanimo osoreru koto wa nai

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,780
The powerful ties that bind our hearts

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,780
Kokoro wo tsunagu tsuyoi kizuna wa

11
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,240
Will never come loose.

12
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,240
Keshite hodoke wa shinai sa

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,960
Sagashitsuzukete tadoritsuita

14
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,960
After a lifetime of searching, we finally arrived

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,760
Here, where the period lies.

16
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,760
Kono basho de piriodo ni

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:23,060
Let's change all our sorrow and rage to power.

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:23,060
Kanashimi ikari chikara ni kaete

19
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,980
Destiny is right within our reach.

20
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,980
Unmei wa sugu soba ni

21
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,700
Dear!

22
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,240
Stay back!

23
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,700
Hey...

24
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,000
I think you owe me an explanation, Wrath...!

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
My past memories won't disappear...

26
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,250
They're making so much noise inside my head!!

27
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,710
Why are you...

28
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,010
Why is King Bradley inside of my memories?!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,760
You!!

30
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,220
What did you do to my belongings?!

31
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,730
This is your greed, huh...

32
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:13,360
You're a fool who craves even his past,
without knowing how to let anything go!

33
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,820
Damn you!

34
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,320
Master!

35
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,490
Madam, Sir Selim, are you two all right as well?!

36
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,870
Y-Yes...

37
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,750
We're terribly sorry.

38
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,420
The guards didn't even stand a chance against him...

39
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,420
No, worry not.

40
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,550
He was quite powerful.

41
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,510
Yes, sir...

42
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,020
Father,

43
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:33,980
hurry up and retire.

44
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,860
Olivier...

45
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,650
You come home after such a long time,
and that's the first thing you have to say?

46
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,490
I'm asking you to spend the remainder of your life in peace after naming me the head of the family.

47
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,370
I plan to have Alex succeed the house.

48
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,750
A coward like him?

49
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:00,380
Why not transfer all of the family property and go on a long vacation to a foreign country or something?

50
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,590
Alex would be nothing but a hindrance to the Armstrong name.

51
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,640
Sister!

52
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,850
So you were home.

53
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,190
Great timing, Alex.

54
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:16,900
Father?

55
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,900
Duel with Olivier.

56
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,190
Pardon?

57
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,690
The victor shall inherit the house.

58
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,570
How does that sound, Olivier?

59
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,620
Perfect.

60
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,910
A plausible solution.

61
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,460
Olivier told me to retire and to leave the country.

62
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,710
What?!

63
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,540
What an insult to our father!

64
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,960
Very well!

65
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:52,060
I shall show you what my muscles are capable of.

66
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,690
Quite brave of you, Alex!

67
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,060
You'll soon see how inexperienced you truly are!

68
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,610
Well then, shall we get going?

69
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,990
Yes.

70
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:10,080
So, where should we go for vacation?

71
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,790
How about Xing, Dear?

72
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,710
I hear the food is wonderful there.

73
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,580
Very well, Xing it is.

74
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,250
Are you okay with that, Catherine?

75
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,040
Yes, Father.

76
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,260
W-Wait...

77
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,020
You wish.

78
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,890
Are you planning on killing me...?

79
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,310
It took you this  long to notice?!

80
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,520
Good luck, Brother!

81
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,570
What should we get for them as souvenirs?

82
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,450
What about an elephant?

83
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,320
They're big and strong.

84
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,490
Wow, I'd like one too!

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,880
No!!!

86
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,510
It would appear the outcome has been decided.

87
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,400
I'm going to inherit everything
owned by the Armstrong family.

88
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,810
Sister...

89
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,820
I hear you've been quite familiar with the upper echelon lately.

90
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,320
Why?!

91
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,700
Do you not know what they're-

92
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,450
I plan to see things with my own eyes before making a decision.

93
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,620
So after you saw their true intentions,

94
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,120
you had the family flee the country in order to keep them safe?

95
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,840
The defeated should disappear.

96
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,800
This mansion belongs to me now.

97
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,450
Where are you headed, little girl?

98
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,870
This is the easternmost town.

99
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,120
Even if you keep going, you'll only find a desert.

100
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,960
Umm... I was planning on going back to my country.

101
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,830
Your country?

102
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,540
Yes. To Xing.

103
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,250
You're going to cross the desert?

104
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,170
Yes.

105
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,470
A little girl like you is going to cross the desert by herself?

106
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,470
Yes.

107
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,390
Hey guys!

108
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,760
Let's get something together!

109
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,560
Bring out some food and the like!

110
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,350
Huh? But...!

111
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,810
Don't be so restrained!

112
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,060
Why not stay here for the night
and leave for your trip tomorrow?

113
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,070
You can use our bath.

114
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,650
Are you hungry?

115
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:52,280
Oh yeah, Steve, you've got an extra room at your place, right?

116
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,240
Why don't you let her stay there?

117
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,570
Sure, fine with me.

118
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,080
My eldest daughter's room is open right now.

119
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,700
Emmy, who left for the university in Central, right?

120
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,540
She's too perfect to be your daughter.

121
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,750
Can't argue with that.

122
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,000
We also need to feed this little kitty something.

123
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,550
Oh, my! You must be really hungry!

124
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,920
Are you sure it's not just looking at you  as its next meal?

125
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,340
Don't be stupid!

126
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,010
That's not true, right, Kitty?

127
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,930
See? It's saying that you look tasty!

128
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,850
Nice people, aren't they?

129
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,320
Are you just going to abandon them?

130
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,440
Well, I guess that's fine.

131
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:38,870
But I don't think you'll gain anything from
bringing back a half-dead homunculus like me.

132
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:46,170
However, if you go to Central, you'll be able to learn the true method to gain immortality.

133
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,250
You may be able to save these people as well.

134
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,130
Oh well.

135
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:56,340
I guess it doesn't mean much to you,
since you're on your way back to your country.

136
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,440
Thank you so much for your kindness, everyone!

137
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,360
Where are you going?!

138
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,230
I still have something I need to take care of!

139
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,150
I'm going back to Central!

140
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,030
What a moron.

141
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,200
If you go back to Central, the cards will be in my favor.

142
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:25,290
As long as I obtain a philosopher's stone, I can return to my original form.

143
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,290
As long as I obtain one...

144
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,690
What is this place?

145
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,310
It's a hideout we've used before.

146
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,030
So this is where your little brother is?

147
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:54,990
Yeah.

148
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,360
One hundred percent positive.

149
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,320
Al will definitely be here!

150
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,320
Hey!

151
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,160
Ow!

152
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,950
There's no one here!

153
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,080
You're such an unreliable brother!

154
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,750
So we came all the way down here for nothing?

155
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,140
Lin.

156
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,480
No... is it Greed?

157
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,730
I'm... starving...

158
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,940
Okay, it's Lin.

159
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,460
Much better!

160
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,460
Thanks for the meal!

161
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,130
You always eat so much, doofus!

162
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,500
So much for our emergency provisions.

163
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,510
Who are those two? Your friends?

164
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,340
Meet Donkey Kong and Li-

165
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,260
My name's Darius!

166
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,590
I'm Heinkel.

167
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:06,260
We used to be in the army, but we're working with this brat right now for various reasons.

168
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,220
Who the hell is he?

169
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,940
Well... how should I explain it...

170
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,480
I'm a homunculus.

171
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,520
Homun-

172
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,520
Hey, hey! Why can't you keep your mouth shut?!

173
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,480
Seriously?!

174
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,780
It's a long story, but...

175
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,740
Hang on, what the hell are you doing here, anyway?

176
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,790
Greed cut all ties with the other homunculi.

177
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:31,500
I took advantage of his restlessness at that point to get my body back from him.

178
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,920
I was looking for a place near Central where I could rest,

179
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,130
and I found this shed...

180
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,340
What's wrong?!

181
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,630
This isn't good!

182
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,510
Greed's trying to take over!

183
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,010
Hey!

184
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,930
Hey! Hey! Wait just a second!

185
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,260
Hold out! Don't lose!

186
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,770
Keep your senses!

187
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,560
Listen up, Ed!

188
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:59,900
That 'Father' guy who lurks beneath Central is going to open the gate on "The Day".

189
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,450
I can only speculate since I'm an amateur at this sort of thing,

190
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:08,160
but wouldn't you and Al be able to get your bodies back if you two leap into that gate?

191
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:11,370
No, wait.

192
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,420
That may be true,

193
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,500
but you need to pay a toll to open the gate...

194
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:21,670
What the hell is he opening the gate for?

195
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,680
Since you said "The Day", does he already know when he's going to open it?

196
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,800
That's...

197
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,310
Lin!

198
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,220
Hey!

199
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:31,890
Dammit...

200
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,440
Don't take over just yet...!

201
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,310
The message...

202
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,990
Did you deliver my message... to Lan Fan?

203
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,030
"Message"?

204
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,950
Al delivered it to her.

205
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,200
Lan Fan is fine.

206
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,620
I don't know where she is now, though.

207
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,500
Wow, I'm glad to hear...

208
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,290
Lin!

209
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,080
Sorry...

210
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:01,050
Can't hold out any... longer.

211
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,560
Damn that prince!

212
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,310
Blabbering on and on...!

213
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,480
Is that you, Greed?

214
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,390
Yeah, it's me.

215
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,650
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

216
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,020
You can't kill me with that.

217
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,900
Sorry to disturb you guys.

218
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:25,700
Hey!

219
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,110
Are you just going to let us go?!

220
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,490
What?

221
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,240
Weren't you listening to what this guy was saying?

222
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,540
I cut ties with the homunculi.

223
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:40,250
I lost it and attacked Bradley.

224
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,340
I don't know what  they'll do to me if I go back.

225
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,010
That's why I'm just going to run off
like this and live an easy life.

226
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,380
Alone.

227
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,350
Want to join us?

228
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,770
If you've got nowhere else to go, then come with us.

229
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,360
Join you...

230
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
Join you, eh?

231
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,870
That's funny.

232
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,740
Cut the shit!

233
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,500
This entire world belongs to me!

234
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:20,540
If you  want to work under me , I just might consider it!

235
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,290
Later.

236
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,810
Comrades, huh...

237
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,100
I've got so many souls inside of me...

238
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,190
And yet, I'm... alone.

239
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,860
Then why don't you join up with Ed and them?

240
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,780
If you don't like that, then give me back my body.

241
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,370
I'll become the Emperor of Xing and fill up the emptiness in your soul.

242
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,700
An emperor of a country, eh...

243
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,330
Big dream, huh?

244
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,870
You brat!

245
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,130
That's way too small.

246
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,000
If you're going to go that way...

247
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,010
Why don't you strive to become the King of the world?

248
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,640
King of the world...

249
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,760
Hey, Lin!

250
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,550
Wait up!

251
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:18,020
What? You guys are so persistent!

252
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,980
I told you, I'm Greed!

253
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,020
I don't even care which one you are anymore!

254
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,900
Just to make it easier, I'll call you Gredlin!

255
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,730
Hey! Who are you calling Gredl-

256
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,400
I'll work under you, Gredlin.

257
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,820
What?

258
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,660
I told you, I'll work for you.

259
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:37,290
Which means these two chimeras working with me will be working for you as well.

260
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,410
What?!

261
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,620
You brat!

262
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,080
Who gave you permission, anyway?!

263
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,250
Don't get so cocky, you runt!

264
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,170
Midget! Flea!

265
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:55,510
Besides, the moment I decided to become a dog of the military, I threw away all my pride.

266
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,680
At this point, I don't really care if I have to wag my tail.

267
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,770
And besides,

268
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:04,520
it would be dumb to lose this opportunity to get information by having my pride take over.

269
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,150
The chance of a lifetime!

270
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,360
How foolish.

271
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,410
You're going to let your strong feelings take over like that and lose important information?

272
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,620
Interesting!

273
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,370
Becoming one of my men also means becoming an outcast!

274
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,750
You better not regret it!

275
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,040
Don't take me lightly!

276
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,130
I've done far worse than this!

277
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,000
What the hell?

278
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,760
Then it's decided.

279
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,880
Then you two are my men as well.

280
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,090
Yeah, sure, whatever.

281
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,760
I don't care who I follow as long as I get to eat.

282
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,020
Just out of curiosity, what kind of chimeras are you?

283
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,100
I'm a gorilla.

284
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,640
Lion here.

285
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,350
That's pretty sweet.

286
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,400
I still have her earrings...

287
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:53,400
Looks like I won't be seeing Winry and Al for a while...

288
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,530
"The Day"... huh.

289
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,330
Seriously, stop coming here all the time!

290
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,180
Dublith

291
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:08,170
Dublith

292
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:08,250
I even said I'd let you know when Miss Izumi returns!

293
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,960
If you keep visiting like this, we'll go out of business!

294
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,390
Curtis butcher shop, how can I help you?

295
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,510
Oh, we're always glad to have your business, sir!

296
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,890
The one you ordered, right?

297
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,430
We'll be back.

298
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,980
Come back as a customer for once, will ya?!

299
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:30,730
I'm sorry, the soldiers were here again.

300
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,110
Yes.

301
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,610
I have a message for you from Alphonse and a man named Hohenheim.

302
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:42,740
Outskirts of North City

303
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:42,740
Outskirts of North City

304
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,070
I see.

305
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,750
That sounds like a pretty big deal.

306
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,080
Yeah.

307
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,080
Got it.

308
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,340
The promised day, huh...

309
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:56,920
Briggs Mountains

310
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,220
Hurry and contact headquarters!

311
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,770
This is Point Papa!

312
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:04,970
We're under attack!

313
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,600
What?! Drachman forces?!

314
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
I don't know!

315
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,940
How many men?!

316
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,850
Just one!

317
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,900
One?! Who are they?!

318
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,940
Hey! I'm asking who they are!

319
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:17,950
Point Papa!

320
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:18,860
Who is the enemy?!

321
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:20,410
A housewife!

322
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:25,370
Briggs Fortress

323
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,450
Frontier troops randomly assaulted by a mysterious woman?

324
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,960
This is just like what happened around twenty years ago.

325
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,210
They were all beat down by one force?

326
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,880
They're really going to get killed by the Major General when she returns.

327
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,550
Major Miles!

328
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:40,550
Briggs Fortress Prison

329
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,510
Good work.

330
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:44,060
An Ishbalan with dark glasses,

331
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,390
and a large man with a mohawk.

332
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,560
Just like I heard.

333
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,810
I was waiting for you two to come out.

334
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,650
Who the hell are you?

335
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:58,150
Like I said, I'm a passing housewife.

336
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,740
I have a message for you from Al.

337
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,740
Can we speak in private?

338
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,790
Yes, it's a message from Alphonse Elric.

339
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,790
Outskirts of North City

340
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,540
All that was contained in the message is "The Promised Day".

341
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,210
Well, well, the promised day.

342
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,500
East City: Grumman's Residence

343
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,920
Very fitting.

344
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,880
Things are really starting to get interesting.

345
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,890
Eastern Headquarters: Firing Range

346
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,220
Hey, Rebecca!

347
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,600
Your skills are as good as ever!

348
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,520
And...

349
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,520
Your butt is as sexy as ever!

350
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,690
What are you doing, Lieutenant General Grumman?!

351
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,110
You shouldn't let your guard down on the battlefield.

352
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,110
By the way, you're friends with Lieutenant Hawkeye, right?

353
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,990
Central

354
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,910
Hey, Riza!

355
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,290
It's been so long, Rebecca!

356
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:56,670
They rescheduled the joint training between the north and the east.

357
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:00,800
You know, because of that battle between Drachma and Briggs from the other day.

358
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:04,430
Now it's planned to take place in the east, right?

359
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,720
I heard from the Führer President.

360
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,430
First, Colonel Mustang, now, the Führer President...

361
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,560
Introduce me to some hot guys in Central, why don't you?

362
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,480
Here's one.

363
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,610
Hayate!

364
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:22,150
Your master is heartless! She's stingy!

365
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,070
You just watch!

366
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:30,290
I'm going to marry some rich guy and retire already!

367
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:32,750
Okay! Good luck!

368
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,040
Oh.

369
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:37,040
Give my regards to Second Lieutenant Havoc.

370
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,290
Sure.

371
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,630
See you later!

372
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,220
"Give my regards to Second Lieutenant Havoc", huh?

373
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:58,400
I'm thinking about transferring to a hospital in the east once my body settles down.

374
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,360
Is that so?

375
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,980
It'll get lonely around here.

376
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,740
If I had known that, I would have brought you something better.

377
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,200
This is for you.

378
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,780
One cigarette a day, right?

379
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,330
Thanks a bunch!

380
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,830
I just ran out of them.

381
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,750
Well, I'll visit you again.

382
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,960
Thanks!

383
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,830
Oh, right.

384
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:17,460
Rebecca was worried about you.

385
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,830
Okie dokie!

386
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,170
If the Colonel visits, please give him my regards.

387
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,550
Sure thing!

388
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,050
Did you hear that, Colonel?

389
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,930
You didn't need to hide like that.

390
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,560
Well, we're both being watched.

391
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,560
It'll be bad if they get suspicious of us after meeting in private.

392
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,940
Delicious...

393
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,740
How about a smoke, Colonel?

394
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,620
No, I'll pass.

395
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,830
Come on, just one for the road.

396
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,130
"In the following Spring,

397
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,180
on the promised day,

398
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,850
both the north and the east will make their move."

399
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:30,820
The promise we never made

400
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:30,820
Kawashita hazu no nai yakasoku ga

401
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,570
yet again

402
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,570
Kyou mo

403
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:36,450
tries to snatch our future away from us.

404
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:36,450
Bokura no mirai wo ubaou to suru

405
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:41,830
Why is it that we can't rejoice

406
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:41,830
Hoshigatteita mono wo te ni shitemo

407
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,040
straight from the heart

408
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,040
Sunao ni

409
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:48,010
Umaku waraenai nowa nazedarou

410
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:48,010
when we obtain something we've always been after?

411
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:53,680
The overflowing tears aren't from feebleness or remorse.

412
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:53,680
Afureru namida wo yowasa ya koukai ja nai

413
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:58,430
They're fragments born from agony.

414
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:58,430
Itami ga unda kakera de

415
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,560
Of all the moments and destinies,

416
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,560
Donna shunkan datte unmei datte

417
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:12,240
I realized there's one absolute certainty.

418
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:12,240
Hitotsu dake tashika na mono ga aru to shitta

419
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,870
Even if things get tough and I'm at my limit

420
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,870
Genkai datte konnan datte

421
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:18,870
I refuse to give up.

422
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:18,870
Akirametakunaiyo

423
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:23,630
Please, don't let go.

424
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:23,630
Konomama hanasanaide

425
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:31,760
I can feel the warmth of your right hand

426
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:31,760
Kataku nigirishimeta kimi no migite no nukumori

427
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,260
where it's tightly joined with my left.

428
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,260
Koko ni arukara

429
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:57,100
The Promised Day

430
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:02,710
In the Spring of next year, the people harden their resolve.

431
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,460
The boy heads for the enemy's lair with determination in his heart.

432
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:13,630
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

433
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:17,660
Episode 46, Looming Shadows.

434
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,660
Looming Shadows

435
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,980
Even if they're far apart, their hearts are linked.

436
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:25,350
As long as they're both on the move.
