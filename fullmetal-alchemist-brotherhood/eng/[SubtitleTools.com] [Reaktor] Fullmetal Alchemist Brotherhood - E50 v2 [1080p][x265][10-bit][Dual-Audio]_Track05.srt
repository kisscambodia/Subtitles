1
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:23,460
We sigh whenever we're about to come to a standstill

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:23,460
Owarinaki tabi no tochuu tachidomarisouna toki

3
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,710
While moving on this endless journey.

4
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,710
Fukai tameiki kobosu bokura wa

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,430
Everytime we lunge for it, it escapes and flies off.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,430
Tsukamikaketewa mata hanareteitta

7
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,850
But now, there's nothing to be afraid of

8
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,850
Demo ima wa mou nanimo osoreru koto wa nai

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,780
The powerful ties that bind our hearts

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,780
Kokoro wo tsunagu tsuyoi kizuna wa

11
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,240
Keshite hodoke wa shinai sa

12
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,240
Will never come loose.

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,960
After a lifetime of searching, we finally arrived

14
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,960
Sagashitsuzukete tadoritsuita

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,760
Here, where the period lies.

16
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,760
Kono basho de piriodo ni

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:23,060
Let's change all our sorrow and rage to power.

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:23,060
Kanashimi ikari chikara ni kaete

19
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,980
Destiny is right within our reach.

20
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,980
Unmei wa sugu soba ni

21
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,980
Shoot everyone except for Colonel Mustang!

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Upheavel in Central

23
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,710
By that,

24
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,340
are you implying that the Madam may be shot as well?

25
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,640
Those are words I wanted to hear, but...

26
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,550
I...

27
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:07,350
No, was my husband abandoned by his country?

28
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,270
Or perhaps, did he abandon me?

29
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,400
I can't say for sure.

30
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:21,200
But you can rest assured that we'll insure your safety.

31
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:29,250
In order to prove after everything is over that what we are currently doing is not in the wrong.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,420
Reinforcements!

33
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,170
Hurry!

34
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,970
Looks like you were saved.

35
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,930
Had we been soldiers from Briggs, you would have been dead.

36
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:43,680
What?!

37
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,430
Long time no see, Colonel.

38
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,020
Yeah. Good work.

39
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,810
What's Lieutenant General Grumman up to?

40
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,980
He's dealing with the aftermath of the train explosion.

41
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,610
Have you not mentioned to the Madam that her husband is currently missing?

42
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,660
I haven't.

43
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,450
It would be hard to move around if she were to pass out from the shock.

44
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,250
They're gathering like ants.

45
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,330
You're too popular, Colonel.

46
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,590
You're telling me...

47
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,590
You still haven't taken care of them?!

48
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,260
What are they doing?!

49
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,760
There are only five enemies!

50
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,640
They've increased in numbers!

51
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,980
Apparently, they're currently at least the size of a platoon!

52
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,600
Our casualties?

53
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,610
59 injured, no deaths, sir!

54
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,230
None?

55
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,030
Damn them...

56
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,910
Are you alright?!

57
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:46,910
Just barely...

58
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,790
The Flame Alchemist is the one who was devastating in Ishbal, right?

59
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,580
Am I the only one who feels like he's not as powerful as the rumors say?

60
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,290
Agreed.

61
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,670
All I've been seeing from him are tiny explosion flames...

62
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,930
Jess! Parkie!

63
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,300
Dammit! He got my eardrum!

64
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,600
What are the casualties?!

65
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,430
5 injured, no deaths!

66
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,560
We're lucky that none were killed.

67
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,650
Both the hero of Ishbal and the "Hawk's Eye" are against us.

68
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,530
It's strange that none of our men have died.

69
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,070
It couldn't be...!

70
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,830
They really are!

71
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,000
They're...!

72
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,670
Going easy on us?!

73
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,540
Yes.

74
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,710
There are quite a few casualties, but none have been killed so far.

75
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,010
Even the ones who were sniped were not hit in critical spots.

76
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,510
Mocking us like that...!

77
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,220
Have the Demetri Squad and Kim Squad deployed as well!

78
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,480
Hurry up and make a stack of the corpses of Mustang's men right here!

79
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,360
They still haven't captured Mustang?

80
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,190
What in the world is Brigadier General Clemin doing?!

81
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:06,240
Apparently, they're only chipping at our forces without killing any of them.

82
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,620
There's no way they can keep up something that crafty for so long.

83
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,240
Colonel Mustang sure is soft.

84
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,910
Seriously.

85
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,000
What the hell is he thinking?

86
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,630
And the Central Army who can't even defeat him are even more inexperienced.

87
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,130
It's almost like child's play.

88
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,260
What did you say?

89
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:33,100
I've heard that headquarters was almost completely frozen by a single traitor.

90
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:39,770
Central has never been attacked by a large force since the country was established.

91
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,900
This inexperience is its greatest weakness.

92
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,030
Good on the offensive, but absolutely terrible on the defensive.

93
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,160
What do you think?

94
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,540
How about you put me in charge of the Central Army for a bit?

95
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,910
Don't get too cocky, Armstrong!

96
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:02,250
Do you think you're here right now because of your own ability?

97
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,920
You're only here so that we can control you.

98
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:10,220
We're aware that you and the soldiers at Briggs have a strong bond.

99
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:17,230
The fact that you're here is a powerful shackle on their wrists to prevent them from 		opposing us.

100
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,770
You guys don't know anything about us!

101
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,950
I've told them beforehand to abandon me in the event of an emergency.

102
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,240
The law of Briggs is "Survival of the Fittest".

103
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:39,080
Even if I were to die here, they'd only shrug it off and say it happened because I was 	too weak.

104
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,580
They're a group that will move on without flinching.

105
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,250
That's what it means to be a soldier at Briggs.

106
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,420
Don't you dare speak of the soldiers I raised without actually knowing them!

107
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:54,550
They're currently exchanging fire with Colonel Mustang and the crew in the industrial area in the west district.

108
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,180
A lot of soldiers were sent to that area.

109
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,610
Let's do this.

110
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,740
Time to say goodbye to this cellar.

111
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,450
Give those cowards at Central a good bite in the windpipe!

112
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,410
See? Here they come.

113
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:23,250
Veterans who can put up a fight against the giant bears at Briggs.

114
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,880
I wonder who'd win; them or those proud dolls of yours?

115
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,260
Dammit!

116
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,230
New forces?!

117
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:43,600
That's ridiculous!

118
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,650
Where did they come from?!

119
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,070
They just suddenly appeared from within the city!

120
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,110
They're not magicians, dammit!

121
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,440
You men go too!

122
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,160
Enemy numbers?

123
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,280
Unconfirmed, sir!

124
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,830
But from their equipment, we can assume that they're from the north!

125
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,490
Briggs...?

126
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,170
From the Armstrong's mansion?

127
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:05,830
Yeah.

128
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:10,960
We snuck soldiers and weapons into the basement while the mansion was being repaired.

129
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,260
How big is the place, exactly?

130
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,050
Charlie!

131
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:14,800
Give me some ammo!

132
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,550
Sorry, we're out too.

133
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,260
This is bad...

134
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,390
What's taking the supply squad so long?

135
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,560
Don't tell me they were captured...

136
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:26,770
If things get really bad, desert me and run.

137
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,610
Roger that!

138
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,820
Isn't this where you're supposed to say, "I'll follow you to the depths of hell"?

139
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,030
Last thing I want to do is to commit double suicide with a guy.

140
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,320
I've got a wife waiting for me at home, too.

141
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,700
Oh...

142
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,120
...really?

143
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,210
Th-They've started using less bullets on us.

144
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,590
I'm assuming they're just about out of ammo.

145
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,720
Okay, let's wrap this up!

146
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,340
Gather everyone that's left!

147
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,100
Hey, Riza!

148
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,900
You're late, Rebecca!

149
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,360
My bad, my bad!

150
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,900
So for those of you who waited so patiently...

151
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,480
I've got a few gifts to hand out!

152
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,490
Amazing...

153
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,200
Not just ammo, but all this too?!

154
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,370
Nice, Rebecca! I love you!

155
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,160
Shut up!

156
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,620
Men without money have no right to hit on me!

157
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,790
Here.

158
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,250
Yeah. Thanks.

159
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,840
It's been a while, Colonel Mustang.

160
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,430
Second Lieutenant Maria Ross,
returning without permission, sir!

161
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,100
Why aren't they rushing in?

162
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,480
They can't approach carelessly because we have the Flame Alchemist on our side!

163
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,950
But the Colonel can't go all out because we're in the middle of the city.

164
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:57,950
Oh my.

165
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:01,950
I came to Central to find hot guys, but it seems like they're all nothing but cowards!

166
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,300
Shit!

167
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,760
Tear-gas grenades from Xing,

168
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,270
packed with red peppers!

169
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,850
You got all of these from Xing?!

170
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,940
I hadn't heard that you were a part of the mission.

171
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,740
You procured all these weapons by yourself?

172
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,280
Or was it on someone else's orders...

173
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,870
Would you like to speak with him?

174
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,960
We're good to go!

175
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,460
Here.

176
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,300
Some important person from Xing, perhaps?

177
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,550
This is Roy Mustang, a colonel in the state military.

178
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,590
I'm terribly grateful for-

179
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,100
What are you acting all polite for?

180
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,310
Come on, Colonel. Just chat like we always used to.

181
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,810
Eighty years at your service.

182
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,360
Anything from underwear elastics to armored vehicles.

183
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,940
Just one call, and we'll have it delivered to you. Anytime, anywhere.

184
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,570
Your friendly neighborhood Havoc General Store!

185
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,070
Havoc!

186
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,120
So, where's the money?

187
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,870
I'll pay up after I'm successful.

188
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,370
Keep it on my tab.

189
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,430
There's smoke rising from the city.

190
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,760
I can faintly hear the sound of an alarm, also.

191
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,600
Looks like the Colonel and the men from Briggs have begun to make their move.

192
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,560
Central must be in a state of pandemonium right now.

193
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,780
Guess it's time to go.

194
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,900
Yeah.

195
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,410
We've prepared the counter for the Nationwide Transmutation Circle,

196
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,200
but it wouldn't hurt to stop it before it's activated.

197
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,910
He's basically just like how he was in the flask, but bigger.

198
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,790
If you destroy his container, he should perish.

199
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:24,800
We'll... also be able to free the souls of the ones that are bound inside him.

200
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:30,310
But how do we get to him?

201
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,690
We're going to use the underground path I took with May in the past.

202
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:38,690
There are tons of deadly chimera, but we should be able to get through with our current party.

203
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,110
You stay here, Heinkel.

204
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,110
Okay.

205
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,150
Sorry about this.

206
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,200
Not your fault.

207
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,740
Doctor Marcoh, make sure the military doesn't find you.

208
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,240
Yoki!

209
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,740
You wait here too.

210
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,410
G-Gladly.

211
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,500
Al.

212
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,920
Yeah, Brother?

213
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:08,430
I'm going to go out for a sec to beat the hell out of a certain bearded nuisance.

214
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,560
Be careful.

215
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:11,680
You got it.

216
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,410
It seems like there's something going on...

217
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,290
I'd hurry if I were you.

218
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:42,300
Father should be revealing the secret to immortality soon.

219
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,460
I know that!

220
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,810
We're going to form a cordon here!

221
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:00,310
Don't let Mustang's group or the Briggs soldiers past the line!

222
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,400
Have your soldiers retreat immediately!

223
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:09,780
You all are the ones who took away my right to command Briggs.

224
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,030
You...!

225
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,830
Do you think you're getting away with this?!

226
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,540
Let me redirect that question right back to you.

227
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,250
You've heard from that 'Father' guy, haven't you?

228
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,340
What you're going to sacrifice and what you're going to gain.

229
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,670
Yes, of course.

230
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,170
We the chosen ones will climb to a new height,

231
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,890
and Amestris will change the world!

232
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,850
Change must be accompanied by pain.

233
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,850
Is it really that hard to understand?!

234
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,600
You pigs are beyond all hope.

235
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:41,270
What?

236
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:52,370
You cowards who hide in the rear lines and glance over the battlefield...

237
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,870
...like to pass off 'pain' as if it were something noble, and proceed to make use of it.

238
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,120
Are you planning to turn traitor?!

239
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,620
I don't know about that.

240
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,670
I may have become a heroine instead, after everything's over.

241
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:06,800
However...!

242
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,260
I'm not as soft as the hero of Ishbal.

243
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,550
W-Wait!

244
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,310
What?!

245
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,310
Sir!

246
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,960
Major Armstrong!

247
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,750
Sergeant Brosh.

248
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,630
Don't you have the day off today?

249
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,710
I rushed here after seeing smoke from my window.

250
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,260
What happened?

251
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:53,220
Colonel Mustang and his former men are holding the Führer President's wife hostage,

252
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,970
and are currently on the run in the city.

253
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,010
What?

254
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,100
That coward!

255
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,100
First, he kills the innocent Second Lieutenant Ross, and now he kidnaps the Madam?

256
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,940
He's a devil in the shape of a human!

257
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,360
Major!

258
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:19,040
In the meeting room at headquarters, Major General Armstrong killed Lieutenant General 	Gardner by...

259
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,540
Shot to death?!

260
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,710
Okay.

261
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,800
Seems like things are moving faster than I'd imagined.

262
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,470
I need to find the young master soon.

263
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:38,390
However, I can't sense him because the giant flow of energy underground is interfering...

264
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,310
Huh?

265
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:45,900
It feels like the energy underground has spread more so than yesterday...

266
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,490
This won't do.

267
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,120
The soldiers are gathered right in front of it, and we can't approach.

268
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,000
It'll be a bit tough to force our way through.

269
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,880
There's another entrance!

270
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,010
Research Laboratory 3!

271
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,890
Al and the Colonel have infiltrated there before and ended up fighting against the 	Homunculi!

272
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,110
Three guards, huh?

273
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,270
Okay, let's do this.

274
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:17,650
No no, this is the time for me to use my position.

275
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,360
Soldiers!

276
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,120
I'm Edward Elric, a State Alchemist!

277
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,160
Huh?

278
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,790
A State Alchemist, sir?!

279
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,290
Please, help me!

280
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,210
I'm being chased by Scar!

281
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,000
He's a wanted man!

282
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,210
Freeze!

283
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
You're terrible.

284
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,980
Shut up, let's go.

285
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,820
Yeah yeah, coming through.

286
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,780
I think it was around here...

287
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,820
Here it is!

288
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,550
Should we split up?

289
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,340
Yeah.

290
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,260
I'll go this way.

291
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,930
Edward and Scar go the other way.

292
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:24,850
What?!

293
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,350
Why do I have to go with him?!

294
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:30,350
If you try to distribute strength alchemy-wise, this would be best.

295
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,730
Besides, when the enemy sealed alchemy,

296
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:37,980
Scar was able to use it but you couldn't do anything, right?

297
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,740
Okay, then these two should go together.

298
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,240
What about the rest of us?

299
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:46,830
I'm not your average Joe, so I'll be fine on my own.

300
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,250
But, well...

301
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,750
I guess I'll take this lady from Xing as my bodyguard.

302
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,880
Okay, so if you see him,

303
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,970
give it your all to destroy him.

304
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,090
Roger!

305
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:07,470
Will you guys really be all right with just the two of you?

306
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,100
Of course.

307
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:14,560
Besides, old men prefer being alone with young women.

308
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,730
What a pervert.

309
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:19,940
Let's go already.

310
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,460
You need to find the Prince of Xing, right?

311
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,890
Go.

312
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,770
Er, but...

313
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,140
Don't worry about us.

314
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,150
He means a lot to you, doesn't he?

315
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,450
Thank you.

316
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,470
Seriously, what pathetic fools!

317
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,980
They can't even fight properly against those monkeys from Briggs?!

318
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,310
Please, wait!

319
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,690
We haven't finished experimenting with the soul attachment process yet!

320
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:39,560
Shut it!

321
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,610
When would be a better time to use them than now?!

322
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:49,620
We've created so many philosopher's stones for situations like this!

323
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,590
Now, move!

324
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:05,720
Devour those traitors!

325
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:45,210
The promise we never made

326
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:45,210
Kawashita hazu no nai yakasoku ga

327
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,010
Kyou mo

328
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,010
yet again

329
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:50,840
tries to snatch our future away from us.

330
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:50,840
Bokura no mirai wo ubaou to suru

331
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:56,430
Why is it that we can't rejoice

332
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:56,430
Hoshigatteita mono wo te ni shitemo

333
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,430
straight from the heart

334
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,430
Sunao ni

335
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:02,400
when we obtain something we've always been after?

336
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:02,400
Umaku waraenai nowa nazedarou

337
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:08,110
The overflowing tears aren't from feebleness or remorse.

338
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:08,110
Afureru namida wo yowasa ya koukai ja nai

339
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,910
They're fragments born from agony.

340
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,910
Itami ga unda kakera de

341
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,950
Of all the moments and destinies,

342
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,950
Donna shunkan datte unmei datte

343
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:26,710
I realized there's one absolute certainty.

344
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:26,710
Hitotsu dake tashika na mono ga aru to shitta

345
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:29,260
Even if things get tough and I'm at my limit

346
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:29,260
Genkai datte konnan datte

347
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,260
I refuse to give up.

348
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,260
Akirametakunaiyo

349
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:38,140
Konomama hanasanaide

350
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:38,140
Please, don't let go.

351
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:45,980
I can feel the warmth of your right hand

352
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:45,980
Kataku nigirishimeta kimi no migite no nukumori

353
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,650
where it's tightly joined with my left.

354
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,650
Koko ni arukara

355
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:04,790
Souls that once dwelled inside humans now dwell inside puppets and are lurching forth.

356
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:11,720
Although their appearances are deformed, their souls are indeed human.

357
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,220
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

358
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:21,250
Episode 51, The Immortal Legion.

359
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,250
The Immortal Legion

360
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,190
Should they be defeated, or should they be spared?
