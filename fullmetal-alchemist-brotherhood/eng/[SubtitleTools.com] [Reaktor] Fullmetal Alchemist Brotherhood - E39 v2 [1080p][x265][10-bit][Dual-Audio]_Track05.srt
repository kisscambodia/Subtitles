1
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:23,460
We sigh whenever we're about to come to a standstill

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:23,460
Owarinaki tabi no tochuu tachidomarisouna toki

3
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,710
While moving on this endless journey.

4
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,710
Fukai tameiki kobosu bokura wa

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,430
Everytime we lunge for it, it escapes and flies off.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,430
Tsukamikaketewa mata hanareteitta

7
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,850
But now, there's nothing to be afraid of

8
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,850
Demo ima wa mou nanimo osoreru koto wa nai

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,780
The powerful ties that bind our hearts

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,780
Kokoro wo tsunagu tsuyoi kizuna wa

11
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,240
Keshite hodoke wa shinai sa

12
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,240
Will never come loose.

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,960
After a lifetime of searching, we finally arrived

14
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,960
Sagashitsuzukete tadoritsuita

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,760
Here, where the period lies.

16
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,760
Kono basho de piriodo ni

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:23,060
Let's change all our sorrow and rage to power.

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:23,060
Kanashimi ikari chikara ni kaete

19
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,980
Destiny is right within our reach.

20
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,980
Unmei wa sugu soba ni

21
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,200
Do you remember the first time we met, Kimblee?

22
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,080
It seems our positions are now reversed!

23
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,250
Don't you dare look down on me!

24
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,270
Daydream

25
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,170
Kimblee, you bastard!

26
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,930
Why... Why is Winry here?!

27
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,510
We were just about to capture Scar, but now he's taken her hostage!

28
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,140
Move.

29
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:09,980
Idiot!

30
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,360
Stop, Crimson Alchemist!

31
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,440
Do you not see Winry in front of you?!

32
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,080
Don't get in my way!

33
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,090
Hold it, Scar!

34
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,340
Sir Kimblee, don't go near the building! It's dangerous!

35
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,550
Withdraw!

36
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,300
There's a blizzard approaching! Hurry!

37
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,150
You're a fantastic actor.

38
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,070
That wasn't an act.

39
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:02,570
I'm actually furious at myself for being such a coward and having to put up such an act.

40
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,700
Why did you kill my parents?

41
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,960
No matter what I say, it'll be only an excuse.

42
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:17,750
The fact is I killed the Rockbells.

43
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,210
With this hand...

44
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:30,730
Girl, you have the right to kill me.

45
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,820
At this rate, you'll die from blood loss.

46
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,080
Winry!

47
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,990
I know.

48
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,500
But I'm sure Mom and Dad would have done the same.

49
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,250
It's a life Mom and Dad saved.

50
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,920
I'm sure there's a meaning to it.

51
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,220
You're saying you'll forgive me?

52
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:08,220
Don't get the wrong idea! I haven't forgiven you for killing my parents unjustly!

53
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:20,980
Winry...

54
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,570
Don't worry; I'm not going to cry.

55
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,910
Didn't I promise you that the next time I cry, it'd be with tears of joy?

56
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,380
Hey, Scar.

57
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:51,010
Despite what Winry just said, I still want to beat you to a pulp and drag you over to the Rockbells' graves.

58
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,850
Should I contact Headquarters?

59
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,520
Yeah.

60
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,020
I believe Miles was your name?

61
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,860
Can I ask something?

62
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,280
What is it?

63
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,780
You called me a fellow countryman, didn't you?

64
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,280
I did.

65
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,000
Until my grandfather's generation, my ancestors were full Ishbalans.

66
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,380
I wish we could have met under different circumstances, my red-eyed brethren.

67
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,170
Why are you siding with the Amestrian army?

68
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:32,850
Because I wish to change the way people feel about Ishbalans from within the country.

69
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,600
I doubt people would change the way they feel so easily.

70
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,360
I don't know how long it'll take.

71
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:47,860
But there are things only I,
a man of mixed parentage, can do.

72
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,910
I'm nothing but an Ishbalan pebble that was thrown into the Amestrian army.

73
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:57,960
But there may come a time when
a small ripple becomes a giant wave.

74
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:07,380
And ironically, the person who made me realize that is a full-blooded Amestrian.

75
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:16,310
I'm nothing but a mass of hatred, born from that civil war.

76
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,270
I'm glad someone like you exists.

77
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,480
Major.

78
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,700
Is this Headquarters?

79
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,160
This is Miles speaking.

80
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,080
We've captured Scar in a building in Area D.

81
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,410
Let Kimblee know.

82
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:43,290
No matter what your circumstances are,
I can't just let you go.

83
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,920
You deserve to be tried and sentenced.

84
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,090
Wait!

85
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,300
Who are you?!

86
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,470
May!

87
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,760
Doctor Marcoh!

88
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,310
Please don't take that man away.

89
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,310
This is bad, Sir Kimblee.

90
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,070
The clouds are moving fast.
The weather's about to get pretty ugly.

91
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,900
Then let's hurry.

92
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,820
Deciphering research documents?

93
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:20,330
It's breakthrough research that combines the alchemies from Amestris and Xing!

94
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,960
But the essential portions are written in ancient Ishbalan.

95
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,300
The only one who can read this is Scar.

96
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,260
So...

97
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,220
You're the girl who knows Eastern Alchemy, right?

98
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,810
I've received orders to take you back to the fort.

99
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,810
Huh?! M-Me?

100
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,390
Don't worry.

101
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,730
I've been ordered to give you a warm reception.

102
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,400
Now... if Scar can't be caught...

103
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,610
...and if we also can't let them know that Marcoh is here...

104
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:57,780
It might be better to just hide them at Briggs for now.

105
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,660
Hang on, what the hell?!

106
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,750
You're taking him, too?!

107
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,130
Don't you guys need him to decipher the documents?

108
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,210
It pisses me off to think we have to ask him  for help...

109
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,720
Why don't we just hand him over to Kimblee and-

110
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,630
A transmutation circle made from this country.

111
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,300
And the history of this country.

112
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,140
I've heard everything from General Armstrong.

113
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:23,730
Something is about to happen;
something that will encompass all of Amestris.

114
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,820
Isn't deciphering the documents of higher priority than anything else?

115
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,570
I'm also aware that Ms. Rockbell has been taken hostage.

116
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,620
If we do this now, we could make Kimblee take the blame and hide her away at the same time.

117
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:50,960
Scar, if you decide to lend us a hand,
we can postpone your trial to a later date.

118
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,260
What do you say?

119
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,380
I have no other options, do I?

120
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,010
I promise to cooperate.

121
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,890
Do you really mean it?

122
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,400
I swear on my Ishbalan blood, my red-eyed brethren.

123
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,810
So, that's how it is.

124
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,650
I'm sorry, but you're going to have to wait a little longer for him to face trial.

125
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,320
That's fine.

126
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,580
Oh yeah, I forgot about these two.

127
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,660
Kill them.

128
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,370
Roger.

129
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,580
H-Hey!

130
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,670
Hang on! You don't have to kill them!

131
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,750
There's nothing to be gained from letting them live.

132
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,290
Do it.

133
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:34,920
This isn't about gain or loss! Isn't there something you could do besides killing them?!

134
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,590
Showing us pity, huh?

135
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,140
There's no need for that. You're just a kid who doesn't know anything.

136
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,810
There's no future for us anyway, since we've got bodies like these.

137
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,600
If you're going to kill us, just do it.

138
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,940
Don't you two have family or people important to you?

139
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,230
Of course we do.

140
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:58,360
But when we were transformed to this state, we were publicly pronounced dead.

141
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,070
I haven't seen them since.

142
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,450
Don't you want  to see them?

143
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,830
Even if we did, there's nothing we could do. Look at us.

144
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:11,540
Oh, so you don't want to return to your old selves?

145
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,250
You're fine with those bodies, then?

146
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,510
Of course not!

147
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,590
Of course we want to return to normal!

148
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,140
Then there's your answer.

149
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,020
Please don't talk as though you've already given up.

150
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,980
You haven't even explored the possibility of returning to your old bodies.

151
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,150
How the hell would you  know how we feel?!

152
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,190
There's no way to-

153
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,370
I'm going to get my body back.

154
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:46,370
No matter how many years it may take, I'll never give up!

155
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,290
Major!

156
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:51,710
What is it?

157
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,420
This isn't good.

158
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,170
A blizzard is approaching.

159
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,920
It's impossible to march in a blizzard with the equipment we have right now.

160
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,930
At this rate, we won't make it back to the fort.

161
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,180
What should we do?

162
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,810
Isn't this a mining town?

163
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,180
Why don't we just take the underground mining path?

164
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,390
Wh-What?!

165
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:17,900
I-It's just that since this is such a big mine, I figured there might be a path leading through the mountain...

166
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,740
I-I think...

167
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,280
That's it!

168
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,320
Sir Yoki!

169
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,030
I used to own a coal mine, after all!

170
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,790
That would work! The mine exits beyond the mountain.

171
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,830
Okay.

172
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,710
If you happen to encounter a soldier from Briggs, hand them this.

173
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:38,510
I've stated the situation in there, so they should give you refuge.

174
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,760
I'm in your debt.

175
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,720
I guess the only thing we still have to account for is the girl.

176
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:53,270
Even if she comes with us, wouldn't the Elric Brothers be the prime suspects if they find out she's missing?

177
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,520
We'll figure something out.

178
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,230
Don't mean to brag, but we can work as well as we can talk.

179
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,950
No, Kimblee is a very suspicious man.

180
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,160
If we don't plan this completely, he'll be doubly suspicious.

181
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:17,210
Umm... this may be a bit strange coming from me...

182
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,130
But...

183
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:24,010
What if I were kidnapped by Scar?

184
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,770
"Kidnapped"?

185
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,060
So... what you mean is...

186
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,150
We free him, and...

187
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:46,320
Yeah. Scar runs off with me in his arms, and you pretend like you're desperately trying to stop him...

188
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:47,780
...or something like that.

189
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,240
Do you think we'll let you do something that dangerous?!

190
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,410
I'm a hostage right now, anyway!

191
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,250
I have to risk my life to escape, or it'll never happen!

192
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,380
But with Scar?!

193
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,880
Yeah! You don't need to risk your  life!

194
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:05,550
Quit trying to do everything by yourselves! I'm tired of it!

195
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:12,180
Hurry up and decide. The blizzard is coming.

196
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,310
Pretty soon, we won't even be able to leave this building.

197
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,070
Kimblee's squad is here!

198
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,240
Dammit!

199
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,700
Scar, if anything happens...

200
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,580
I know. I plan to keep my promise.

201
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,290
Could you...

202
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,800
Could you take us, as well?

203
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,550
I understand you don't trust us,

204
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,680
so you can keep us bound.

205
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,720
Sir Kimblee shows no mercy to men who can't do their job.

206
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,640
We'll get killed either way.

207
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,560
And besides...

208
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,150
...we don't want to give up, either!

209
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,440
We can trust you, right?

210
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:10,530
If you two happen to betray us and get in our way, this country could fall to ruin.

211
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,700
Including the people you two hold dear.

212
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,700
Hang on! What do you mean?!

213
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,380
Central never told us anything like that!

214
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,250
Tell us the details! What is this about?!

215
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,550
Is this fine?

216
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,640
Yeah. You all will probably feel safer this way, too.

217
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,440
Scar, we're going to have to ask you to put on an act.

218
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,440
I know.

219
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,690
Keep the vow you swore on your Ishbalan blood.

220
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,120
Hey! You need to take off your earrings!

221
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,250
Those are made out of metal, aren't they?

222
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,750
If you don't take them off, you'll get frostbite.

223
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,050
Ed.

224
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,760
Hold on to these for me.

225
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,680
I'll be waiting for you at the fort!

226
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,700
Kimblee, you bastard!

227
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,780
Why the hell didn't you keep an eye on Winry?!

228
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,720
I'm worried about Zampano and Jerso.

229
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:55,970
They were either killed by Scar, or they can't move because of the blizzard...

230
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,470
Scar shouldn't be able to move, either.

231
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,060
He has to be in this town somewhere!

232
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,230
We ought to plan our next search while we're sitting here!

233
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,780
This blizzard really saved us...

234
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:12,150
I pray that all of you will make it to the fort.

235
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,320
Major Miles, you have a phone call from Briggs.

236
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,950
Miles speaking.

237
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,790
What?!

238
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:33,550
Oh, so you're the daughter of those Rockbells.

239
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,300
You've heard of my parents?

240
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:41,810
There isn't a single doctor who was in Ishbal who hasn't.

241
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:45,810
They fulfilled their duties as doctors without any regard for their own lives.

242
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,730
I haven't forgiven that you killed my parents unjustly!

243
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:55,070
You must endure.

244
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:58,370
So you're telling me to forgive the army for what they did?

245
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,740
"Enduring" and "forgiving" are two different things.

246
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,370
You must not forgive the unjustness of society.

247
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,960
As a human being, you must hold the event in contempt.

248
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,880
Yet, you must endure.

249
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,170
You must put an end to the chain of hatred!

250
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:17,090
If many negative emotions gather,
they will end up influencing the entire world.

251
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,680
But on the other hand, it is also possible to gather positive emotions and lead the world in that direction.

252
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:27,690
That is why I study alchemy.

253
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,530
Oh, here we are.

254
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,820
What is this place?

255
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,660
It's a post for mine officers.

256
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,780
There should be...

257
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,370
Ah, found it.

258
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,450
See? A detailed map of the mine.

259
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,460
It looks pretty complicated.

260
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,460
I don't understand what goes where.

261
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,290
We can just take this path here, you see?

262
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,760
Wow, you're pretty amazing.

263
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,170
Keep the compliments coming!

264
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,140
With this, we should be able to reach the other side of the mountain a lot faster than we thought we would.

265
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:08,640
Hey, Doctor Marcoh... Do you think those research documents hold anything to get us back to our old bodies?

266
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,560
There is a possibility.

267
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,400
It's tough to say because it's not a form of alchemy we're familiar with.

268
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,570
I've got faith, Doctor!

269
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:19,610
I really want to see my family!

270
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:23,240
Even though your wife was always leading you by the nose?

271
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,040
You probably only want to see your daughter.

272
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:31,580
Look who's talking! You always turn nasty when you're drunk, so your son was just about fed up with you.

273
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,880
You still have the guts to see him now?

274
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,710
That was brutal.

275
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,430
Is something wrong, May?

276
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,720
No.

277
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:48,180
I was just wondering when I'll be able to return, since my people are waiting for me...

278
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:54,940
The philosopher's stone uses the lives of humans.

279
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:58,190
I mustn't seek such a thing.

280
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,530
Even if I tell him how to create one,
without bringing back an actual stone,

281
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,910
the Emperor would make plans to create one without hesitation.

282
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,580
By sacrificing the lives of many people...

283
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:13,790
Immortality... Just what should I do?

284
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:19,050
That answer may also be hidden in those research documents.

285
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:22,890
So let's try to get to the fort as quickly as we can to decipher them.

286
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,640
You're right.

287
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,430
The fort is no longer safe?!

288
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:31,060
Major General Armstrong has been summoned to Central.

289
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,480
Many soldiers from Central are now stationed at the fort, as well.

290
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:38,070
Kimblee must have proposed it.

291
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:42,240
He was making quite a few phone calls while at the fort, after all.

292
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:45,830
Hang on. If the Major General is no longer there...

293
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,080
An officer loyal to Bradley is going to be stationed there.

294
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,870
So, Winry and the rest of them...

295
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:54,420
It's going to be a lot more difficult to hide them there now.

296
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,880
That's hardly the issue. If things take a turn for the worse, they could fall in the hands of the enemy...

297
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,640
We have to let them know somehow!

298
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,140
It would be impossible to go after them in this blizzard.

299
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,220
But we can't just leave them!

300
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,520
I'm going.

301
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,230
An amateur shouldn't take a blizzard lightly!

302
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,480
It'll suck out all your strength in a matter of minutes, leaving you to freeze to death.

303
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,230
There's another option.

304
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,410
There's someone here with a body that knows no fatigue and won't freeze.

305
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,380
This is worse than I expected...

306
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:41,210
Now, where's the landmark...

307
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,010
There!

308
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,020
I can't see anything with the snow blowing everywhere.

309
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,500
What was that just now? My body?!

310
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,130
Why?

311
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,680
It's impossible to place a soul on a body that doesn't belong.

312
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,350
A body that shouldn't possess a soul...

313
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:36,940
A rejection reaction!

314
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:42,150
My old body is pulling my soul towards it!

315
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:49,240
Come on! Get it together!

316
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,660
I have to hurry.

317
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,040
Alphonse Elric.

318
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:06,130
Edward Elric.

319
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,680
And...

320
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,890
...Van Hohenheim.

321
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,440
Izumi Curtis is also a possibility.

322
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,530
Just one more.

323
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:45,300
The promise we never made

324
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:45,300
Kawashita hazu no nai yakasoku ga

325
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,090
yet again

326
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,090
Kyou mo

327
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:50,930
Bokura no mirai wo ubaou to suru

328
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:50,930
tries to snatch our future away from us.

329
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:56,520
Why is it that we can't rejoice

330
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:56,520
Hoshigatteita mono wo te ni shitemo

331
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,520
straight from the heart

332
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,520
Sunao ni

333
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,480
when we obtain something we've always been after?

334
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,480
Umaku waraenai nowa nazedarou

335
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:08,190
The overflowing tears aren't from feebleness or remorse.

336
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:08,190
Afureru namida wo yowasa ya koukai ja nai

337
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:12,990
They're fragments born from agony.

338
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:12,990
Itami ga unda kakera de

339
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,040
Donna shunkan datte unmei datte

340
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,040
Of all the moments and destinies,

341
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:26,800
I realized there's one absolute certainty.

342
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:26,800
Hitotsu dake tashika na mono ga aru to shitta

343
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,340
Even if things get tough and I'm at my limit

344
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,340
Genkai datte konnan datte

345
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,340
I refuse to give up.

346
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,340
Akirametakunaiyo

347
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:38,220
Please, don't let go.

348
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:38,220
Konomama hanasanaide

349
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:46,070
I can feel the warmth of your right hand

350
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:46,070
Kataku nigirishimeta kimi no migite no nukumori

351
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,740
where it's tightly joined with my left.

352
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,740
Koko ni arukara

353
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,450
A departure toward an unknown world.

354
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:03,920
It's due to one's heart seeking something new.

355
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,710
A human can never go against the wishes of his heart,

356
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:11,510
but conflict always arises in that moment.

357
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,720
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

358
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,220
Episode 40, Homunculus.

359
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,240
Homunculus
(The Dwarf in the Flask)

360
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,690
The righteous isn't the one to win.

361
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:25,940
The one to overcome the boundaries shall stand as the winner.
