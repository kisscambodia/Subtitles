1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,920
I've still got a lot of years ahead of me

2
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,920
Kono omoi wo keshiteshimau niwa

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:05,810
To just erase these feelings?

4
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:05,900
Mada jinsei nagai desho?

5
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:05,850
To just erase these feelings?

6
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:05,900
To just erase these feelings?

7
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,900
I want to go back and finish

8
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,900
Yarinokoshiteru koto

9
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,530
The things that I've yet to finish.

10
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,530
Yarinaoshite mitai kara

11
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:28,790
I was supposed to be chasing after my ongoing dream,

12
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:28,790
Yume no tsuzuki oikaketeita hazu nanoni

13
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:35,130
Magarikunetta hosoi michi hito ni tsumazuku

14
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:35,130
Yet I faltered over others while walking this thin, winding path.

15
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,300
It's not that I want to return to those days.

16
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,300
Ano koro mitainitte modoritai wake ja nai no

17
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,810
I'm searching for the sky I lost.

18
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,810
Nakushitekita sora wo sagashiteru

19
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,480
Don't make that sad face, as if you've fallen victim.

20
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,480
Wakatte kuremasu youni

21
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,690
As if you want people to pity you.

22
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,690
Gisei ni natta youna kanashii kao wa yameteyo

23
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,400
Tears aren't the end of your sins.

24
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,400
Tsumi no saigo wa namida ja nai yo

25
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,070
You have to bear them painfully, forever.

26
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,070
Zutto kurushiku seottekunda

27
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,740
Who are you waiting for in the maze of emotions,

28
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,740
Deguchi mienai kanjoumeiro ni

29
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,400
Where you can't even see the exit?

30
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,400
Dare wo matteruno?

31
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,200
I want to blurt it out more justly,

32
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,200
Shiroi nooto ni tsuzutta youni

33
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,950
Just like how I wrote it in my white notebook.

34
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,950
Motto sunao ni hakidashitai yo

35
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,620
What do you want to run from?

36
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,620
Nani kara nogaretainda

37
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,240
That thing called "reality"?

38
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,240
Genjitsu tte yatsu?

39
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,580
Kanaeru tame ni ikiterundatte

40
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,580
I just want to scream out,

41
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,000
"I'm only living to fulfill my wish." Can you hear me?

42
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,000
Sakebitaku naru yo kikoeteimasuka?

43
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,130
I can't take the safe way out of everything.

44
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,130
Bunan ni nante yatterarenaikara

45
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,920
I don't even have a place to return to.

46
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,920
Kaeru basho mo nai no

47
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,220
I'm always thankful for everyone's kindness,

48
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,220
Yasashisa ni wa itsumo kansha shiteru

49
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,600
That's why I want to become stronger. (I'm on the way)

50
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,600
Dakara tsuyoku naritai (I'm on the way)

51
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,560
This is reminding me of the old days.

52
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,560
Natsukashiku naru

53
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,810
This pain is all right with me.

54
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,810
Konna itami mo kangei jan

55
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:40,320
Ed and Al infiltrated the former Research Laboratory 5,
seeking the secret of the philosopher's stones.

56
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,950
There, they encountered people who had their souls affixed to suits of armor.

57
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:58,920
Due to what Number 66 said during their battle, Al started to question whether he was a faux soul, created by Ed.

58
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,990
Created Feelings

59
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,630
Looks like you're able to get up now.

60
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,300
What happened to Research Laboratory 5?

61
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,720
About that...

62
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,890
It was blown up by someone and has been completely destroyed...

63
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,730
Dammit!!! It's all gone?!

64
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,150
O-Oww...

65
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,730
D-Dammit...

66
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,450
I was so close to the "truth", too!

67
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,120
I can't be sitting in a hospital like this!

68
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,370
Mr. Fullmetal Alchemist!

69
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,120
We apologize for the rudeness in advance!

70
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,370
Huh?

71
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,930
Doing whatever you wanted...

72
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,430
If things had gone badly, you would have died!

73
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:56,680
Instead of trying to do everything by yourselves, rely on the people around you!

74
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,860
It wouldn't hurt to trust your elders, don't you think?

75
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,280
That is all!

76
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,910
Please forgive our rude language and violence toward a higher-ranking officer, sir!

77
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,830
N-No...

78
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,920
My fault.

79
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,920
Punishment... for the slap, sir?

80
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,090
No, I wouldn't dream of it!

81
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,510
Why do you guys try to be so considerate around me?

82
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,550
Because being a State Alchemist is equivalent to being a Major in the army.

83
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,520
I didn't get my state qualification for something like that.

84
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,350
You guys don't need to be so polite to me, either.

85
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,770
Oh, really?

86
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,150
Wow, all those times have been a waste, haven't they?

87
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,070
What a quick change!

88
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,150
Oh... now that I think about it, where's Al?

89
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,700
I scolded him with a fist earlier.

90
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,830
Ow...

91
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,080
I forgot about the other person who's going give me a scolding.

92
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,090
Hello? You've reached the Rockbells,
specializing in prosthetics and orthotics.

93
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,180
Ed?

94
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,220
It's rare for you to call.

95
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,970
U-Umm...

96
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,640
This is extremely difficult for me to say, but...

97
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,650
Do you mind taking a trip to Central for a little maintenance?

98
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,810
Trip?

99
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:25,480
Well...

100
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,360
It's my right arm.

101
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,400
My fingers move, but I can't lift my arm at all.

102
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,620
So it was no good, after all.

103
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,160
Huh?

104
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,910
No, no, it's nothing.

105
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,210
Did you do something before your arm stopped moving?

106
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,590
I-I was in an all-out brawl.

107
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,680
AGAIN?! Quit using my automail for things like that!

108
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,220
H... Hello?

109
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,680
Miss Winry?

110
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,230
I guess there's no choice.

111
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,690
Where in Central?

112
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,780
Hey, you're kind of nice tod-

113
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,740
I mean... Nothing...

114
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,280
Okay. Gotcha.

115
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,620
Sorry for the trouble.

116
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,370
Yeah.

117
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,120
Thanks.

118
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,870
A love call to your girlfriend?

119
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,120
Who's my girlfriend?!

120
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,710
How boring.

121
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,460
When I was your age, I had...

122
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,380
Huh?

123
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,260
What are you doing over there?

124
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,800
Hey, Al!

125
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,430
Brother...

126
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,390
Want to head to our room?

127
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:44,810
Hm?

128
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,980
No, it's nothing.

129
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,060
I'll meet you there.

130
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,610
Okay.

131
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,300
Bye!

132
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,600
...maybe you're an armor doll that your "brother" created?

133
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,190
Oww, my rear...

134
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,900
I don't see how Ed and Al can ride these things all the time.

135
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:43,490
He said there'd be someone waiting for me at the
west gate, and I'd be able to spot him right away, but...

136
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,500
Oh.

137
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,710
Major Armstrong!

138
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,420
Ah, Miss Winry!

139
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,210
Where are those stupid Elric brothers?

140
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,720
To tell you the truth...

141
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,810
Ed's in the hospital?!

142
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,560
Th-That was fast.

143
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,110
You're planning on charging me a rush fee, aren't you?

144
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:22,990
But... you were injured this badly when your automail broke, because I...

145
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,700
...I didn't equip it properly, right?

146
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,210
I-It's not your fault or anything!

147
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:38,220
I'm the one who used it recklessly,
and the maintenance was perfect, as always.

148
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:43,100
He didn't notice the missing screw?

149
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:47,850
And there's also the fact I didn't have to get hurt more because my arm broke!

150
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,690
So don't worry about it! Yeah? Yeah?

151
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,110
So it all works out?

152
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,610
Okay, so about this maintenance trip!

153
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,990
On second thought, I'll be charging a rush fee!

154
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,820
Huh?

155
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,620
You didn't drink your milk.

156
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,500
I... don't like milk.

157
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,580
And that's why you're so short!

158
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,670
Shut up!

159
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,000
I can't help that I don't like it!

160
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,630
You're being picky, Edward Elric!

161
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,140
All the kids drink it.

162
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,850
You won't get any girls if you can't drink milk.

163
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:27,930
Al?

164
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,780
Al's been acting strange lately.

165
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,280
What do you mean by strange?

166
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,280
Seems to me something's on his mind.

167
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:04,550
...maybe you're an armor doll that your "brother" created?

168
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,300
Just accept it. It'll make you feel better.

169
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,440
There! Maintenance complete!

170
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,610
Awesome!

171
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,030
It's finally fixed.

172
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,700
Thanks a lot.

173
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,110
You're welcome.

174
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,450
Yo, Ed!

175
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,200
So I heard you're kind of occupied after bringing a woman into your room.

176
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,830
She's just my automail mechanic!

177
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,670
Wow... so you sweet-talked your mechanic, huh...

178
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,460
When I say one thing, you come up with another!

179
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,050
I'm Maes Hughes.

180
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:45,970
Pleasure to meet you.

181
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,180
I'm Winry Rockbell.

182
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,720
Won't you get in trouble for ditching work?

183
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,720
No need to worry!

184
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,060
I left Sheska with overtime work.

185
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,400
What are you, a demon?

186
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,900
Oh yeah, you guys are almost free from your escorts.

187
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,440
Really?!

188
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,740
Escorts?

189
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,570
Hey, you...

190
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,070
Just what kind of dangerous situations are you getting yourself into?!

191
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,990
Well, look. How should I put it...

192
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,500
I-It's not a big deal.

193
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,340
That's right.

194
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,510
You two never tell me anything, anyway.

195
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,390
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

196
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,190
I'm going to go look for a place to stay for the night.

197
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,100
What?!

198
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,400
Then stay at my place!

199
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:41,610
But...

200
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,150
Don't worry about it!

201
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,940
My wife and daughter will be delighted.

202
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,490
No, but...

203
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,900
All right, it's settled!

204
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,200
Huh?! Wait!

205
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,660
Come on, let's go!

206
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,450
Hang on!!!

207
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,380
Happy birthday Elicia!

208
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:10,680
U-Umm, Mr. Hughes? What exactly is...

209
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,930
Why, thank you for asking.

210
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:16,180
Today is Elicia's birthday, so to speak!

211
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,730
So to speak!

212
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,560
So how old are you now, Elicia?

213
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,480
Tw-

214
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,480
Three!

215
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,530
Sh...

216
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,490
She's...

217
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,990
So cute!

218
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:45,300
I've been with them ever since we were little, so they're kind of like my brothers.

219
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,510
You must always be worried about them with the way they are, aren't you?

220
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,010
You bet!

221
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:53,760
They came home after such a long time,
and Ed's arm was in pieces.

222
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,770
And when they called me up, Ed's severely injured...

223
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,020
...and Al's being troubled by something...

224
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:10,450
But they'll never tell me what happened.

225
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,820
Even when they left Resembool...

226
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,160
They probably didn't feel the need to discuss it.

227
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,790
They probably thought that you'd understand, even if they didn't tell you.

228
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:31,760
But... there are some things in life that will only be understood through words.

229
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,550
I guess that's just the way things are.

230
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,020
Guys always convey things with actions, not words,

231
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,770
so if it's something tough, they don't want others to have to put up with it.

232
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:48,270
They don't want to worry people, either.

233
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,530
So they don't say it.

234
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:56,030
But even then, if those brothers happen to whine...

235
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,120
...you comfort them and set them straight.

236
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,540
I think that's perfect.

237
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,380
Elicia, let's play!

238
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,880
I'm getting off!

239
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,380
Here you go.

240
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:16,220
Hey! Elicia's going to be playing with me!

241
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,390
What? I'm  going to be playing with her!

242
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,060
Your daughter sure is popular.

243
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,100
No!

244
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,850
She's mine!

245
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,440
Hey, you brats!

246
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,900
Do something to my daughter and see what happens!

247
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,650
You don't need to convey things with actions that  much!

248
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,490
Are you sure?

249
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:38,990
You can stay here for as long as you're in Central, you know.

250
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,540
No, that would be too much trouble...

251
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,500
She's gotten so attached to you.

252
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,500
From this perspective, they almost look like sisters.

253
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,550
Winry!

254
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,050
Have a nice day!

255
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,630
Come home soon, okay?

256
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,640
Looks like it's decided.

257
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,140
It's like I have a little sister now!

258
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:15,320
So you came again, bastard.

259
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,410
You've got a living body...

260
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,080
...so you have to drink it.

261
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,540
I can't help that I don't like it!

262
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,920
I'm actually growing, despite how I look.

263
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,550
But everyone just calls me puny...

264
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,130
You've got it easy, Al.

265
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,890
Since you're so big already.

266
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,100
I didn't become like this because I wanted to!

267
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,900
M-My bad...

268
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,480
You're right.

269
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,190
It's my fault we became like this, after all.

270
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,860
That's why I want to get your body ba-

271
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,740
Is there really a guarantee
I'll be able to return to my old body?!

272
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,490
I'll make it come true.

273
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,700
Believe in me.

274
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,200
Believe?!

275
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,710
What am I supposed to believe with this empty body?!

276
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:11,330
Memories are just information if you really think about it!

277
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,050
It should be possible to create them artificially!

278
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,970
What are yo-

279
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:21,010
Brother, you once told me there was something you couldn't say to me because you were too afraid, right?

280
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,680
Could it be you were trying to say...

281
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:30,980
...that I'm just a fake... an artificial soul and a set of memories you created?!

282
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:38,990
Winry, you and Granny are both trying to deceive me, aren't you?

283
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,950
Am I right, Brother?!

284
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,960
Are those the thoughts you've been holding in?

285
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,960
Is that all you've got to say?

286
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,840
I see.

287
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,110
Ed...

288
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,020
Ed!

289
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,820
Al, you...

290
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,280
IDIOT!!!

291
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,790
W-What was that for?!

292
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,960
Winry?!

293
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,420
You moron!

294
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,340
You don't even know how Ed feels!

295
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,130
What Ed was afraid to ask you...

296
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,760
...is whether you hate him or not!

297
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,730
It's all... my fault...

298
00:16:53,730 --> 00:17:00,530
He can't even eat, sleep, or feel pain anymore...

299
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:03,530
He... He hates me for sure...

300
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:06,780
Al wouldn't.

301
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,530
Why don't you just ask him?

302
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,200
I... I'm scared...

303
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,870
I'm too scared to ask...

304
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:19,920
And... And yet...

305
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,170
You...

306
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:30,680
Just who the heck would be prepared to
give up his life just to create a fake brother?

307
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:36,900
Don't you two only have each other?

308
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:42,900
Go after him!

309
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,610
Y... Yeah.

310
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,660
MOVE!

311
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,620
Yes, ma'am!

312
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:03,880
Brot-

313
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:09,470
Now that I think about it, I've gotten a bit rusty because we haven't sparred in a while.

314
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,300
Huh?

315
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,770
Wha? Wa-

316
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,570
W-Wait a second, Brother!

317
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,110
Hold on!

318
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,910
Your wounds are going to open back up!

319
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,210
I win!

320
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,130
For the first time in my life, I beat you!

321
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,970
That wasn't fair, Brother.

322
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,630
Sh-Shut up!

323
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,970
A win's a win!

324
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:54,270
We've always fought a lot, haven't we.

325
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,100
Yeah.

326
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,150
Now that I think about it, we fought for the dumbest reasons, didn't we?

327
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,520
Like who gets to sleep in the top bunk.

328
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,230
Yep.

329
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,070
We fought over snacks, too, didn't we?

330
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,860
We also fought over toys.

331
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,200
I won.

332
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,990
Even when we played by Raine River...

333
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,160
You pushed me in, didn't you?

334
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,500
We fought all the time during our training, too, remember?

335
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:20,580
That was a draw since Master nearly beat us both to death for being "annoying".

336
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,880
We also fought over who would marry Winry.

337
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,920
I don't remember that!

338
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,760
I won. But she said no.

339
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,680
I-I see...

340
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,690
Are you going to tell me all that was a lie?

341
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:42,610
I'm sorry...

342
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:46,110
We want to return to our bodies, no matter what it takes.

343
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,820
Are you trying to say those feelings are artificial, too?

344
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,860
They're not.

345
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,950
That's right.

346
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,280
We decided to return to our bodies together, for sure.

347
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,580
We're going to be moving forward!

348
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,380
If we move forward, we'll get stronger, both physically and mentally.

349
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,590
What about milk?

350
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,500
I'll drink it!

351
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,630
...as much as possible.

352
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,510
Let's get stronger.

353
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,590
Yeah.

354
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,720
Mr. Hughes.

355
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:19,350
There are things that can only be conveyed through words. Don't you agree?

356
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,850
You're right.

357
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,660
Brother...

358
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,290
Master...

359
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,880
Where... did everyone...

360
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,300
Hi.

361
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,130
You're not an Ishbalan, are you?

362
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,180
Ah, pardon me.

363
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,300
I haven't introduced myself yet.

364
00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:00,810
I'm a State Alchemist who is going to be in charge of destroying this area.

365
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,440
Oh, he's awake.

366
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,900
Where am I?

367
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,240
You're in the slums on the outskirts of East City.

368
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:20,290
Sir... you are...

369
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:23,870
I'm Ishbalan, just like yourself.

370
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:27,840
Don't worry, I won't sell you out or anything.

371
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,840
Are there other Ishbalan survivors in this place?

372
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,300
There sure are.

373
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:38,550
Even a soot-covered place like this feels like a city if you live here.

374
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:44,850
In other words, "All of this world is within the bosom of our God, Ishvala."

375
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,520
I... see...

376
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,900
Don't push yourself!

377
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,320
You were floating around in the sewers, covered in wounds.

378
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,910
Hey...

379
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,330
Is my right arm still attached?

380
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,830
Yeah, it is.

381
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,760
These tattoos are amazing.

382
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,260
Yeah.

383
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:23,470
It's a precious bond I received from my family...

384
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:33,010
Say, the sky we saw that day, the scarlet sky.

385
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:33,010
Ano hi mita sora akaneiro no sora wo

386
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:38,220
Do you remember it from that day?

387
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:38,220
Nee kimi wa oboeteimasuka

388
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:44,140
We made a promise and a vow while the early summer wind circled us.

389
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:44,140
Yakusoku chigiri shoka no kaze ga tsutsumu

390
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:48,400
And we clung close together.

391
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:48,400
Futari yorisotta

392
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:57,450
Your forced smile

393
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:57,450
Muri na egao no ura

394
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:02,830
Holds elongated shadows.

395
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:02,830
Nobita kage wo kakumau

396
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:12,090
I pretend not to notice and continue on.

397
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:12,090
Dakara kizukanu furi saisei wo erabu

398
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:21,600
All the while waiting for you to deliver some news at the table.

399
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:21,600
Teeburu no ue no furuenai shirase machitsuzukete

400
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:29,980
Empty nights, mornings that will never arrive,

401
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:29,980
Kuuhaku no yoru mo kuru hazu no nai asa mo

402
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:34,730
I could see them from a mile away.

403
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:34,730
Zenbu wakattetanda

404
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:40,360
Ano hi mita sora akaneiro no sora wo

405
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:40,360
Say, the sky we saw that day, the scarlet sky.

406
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,290
I'm sure you'll remember it one day.

407
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,290
Nee itsuka omoidasu deshou

408
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:51,130
While holding the promise we couldn't keep,

409
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:51,130
Hatasenakatta yakusoku wo idaite

410
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:55,380
We take our first steps down our own paths.

411
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:55,380
Futari arukidasu

412
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,970
Your best friend eventually becomes your comrade-in-arms, and finally, an everyday fixture in your life.

413
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:13,480
Even if the future you discussed had turned into a shade of lead, your best friend hadn't changed and was always there.

414
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:18,610
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

415
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,620
Separate Destinations

416
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:21,610
Episode 10, Separate Destinations.

417
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:26,740
A fixture in one's life. Something like that cannot be replaced.
