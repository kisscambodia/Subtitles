1
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,240
Come on!

2
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,120
Drink up.

3
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,240
Pinako...

4
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,000
Mind if I join you?

5
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,400
Can't focus. My body is still puzzled about what to do.

6
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,400
Shuuchuu dekitenaina mada karada ga mayotteirunda

7
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,160
I'm trembling. I can't stop even if I try to control myself.

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,160
Furueteitanja kontoroorushitatte burerunda

9
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,910
Although neither sun nor moon are on my side,

10
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,910
Taiyou mo tsuki mo nanmo kanzen ni kocchi muiteinaiga

11
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,330
"I've no choice but to try,"

12
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,330
Yarushikanainda

13
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,000
Those were the words I muttered to myself.

14
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,000
Iikikaseruyouni sotto tsubuyaita

15
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,590
The odds aren't on my side, but running way'd be gutless.

16
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,590
Joukyou wa waruiga tada nigedasunja konjou nainaa

17
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,590
Even if I can't see the future, I'll just have to win it over with courage.

18
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,590
Tenbou wa naiga dokyou de kuria suru shika naiya

19
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,090
Need to keep distance from the target as I hold myself back.

20
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,090
Shoudou wa osaetamama taagetto to no kankaku sagure

21
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,390
All that's needed for victory is pride to win.

22
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,390
Hitsuyou na mon wa katsu puraido

23
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,480
Will we celebrate with the wine of victory

24
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,480
Ajiwau nowa shouri no bishu ka

25
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,480
Or'll we end up kissing their feet in defeat?

26
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,480
Soretomo haiboku no kujuu ka

27
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,230
There are two outcomes to everything.

28
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,230
Sou subete wa futatsu ni hitotsu

29
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,950
I want to control destiny.

30
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,950
Ayatsuritai unmei no ito

31
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,280
I need to seize the golden opportunity with my hands.

32
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,280
Zekkou no goorudentaimu kono te de tsukame

33
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,370
I'll finish it up with my best poker face,

34
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,370
Konshin no pookaafeisu kimete shikakeruyo

35
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:41,330
And drag them into a world of illusions.

36
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:41,330
Iryuujon no sekai e hikizurikonde

37
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,670
I'll find my way out of this endless pressure game,

38
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,670
Saigennai puresshaageemu sururito nukete

39
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,680
And leap over the borderline of honor.

40
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,680
Eikou no boodaarain tobikoeru tameni

41
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,390
Haumenii? Dorekurai no daishou ga iru?

42
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,390
How many? What'll I need to sacrifice to make it happen?

43
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,650
What is the one thing I don't want to let go?

44
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,650
Tebanashitakunai mon wa dore?

45
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,490
Interlude Party

46
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,890
It's nice to let loose like this every once in a while.

47
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,400
You probably think we're the most carefree people on earth, don't you?

48
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,160
But who can blame us?

49
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,830
This country's always at war.

50
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:43,920
And now there's something going on over in Ishval... is that all this country is good for?

51
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,220
They never learn.

52
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,180
Humans are foolish, pitiful creatures.

53
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,290
With Ishbal and other riots...
the East sure have their hands full.

54
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:25,010
Not just the East, but there are riots and border wars
sparking up in the North and the West.

55
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,510
Skirmishes are still ongoing on the border with Aerugo to the south and Creta to the west.

56
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,270
And there's still the great nation of Drachma up north, too.

57
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,690
Mountains of corpses everywhere, huh...

58
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,270
We may even get a coup soon...

59
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,780
Such a scary country to be in...

60
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:50,160
This country's been so military-focused ever since King Bradley became the Führer President.

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,710
Hey, let's dance!

62
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,960
You're quite the stud, Hohenheim!

63
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,670
Why don't you go dance by yourself?

64
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,720
But that's no fun!

65
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:13,140
This man isn't fancy enough to dance.

66
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,850
Come on, go dance with those girls over there.

67
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,940
I think that's about how old they were...

68
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,280
...when they started to even think about something like human transmutation.

69
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,250
Why didn't you take a stand as
their father and say something to them?

70
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:51,890
Even if I did, it wouldn't change the fact they'd have to repent for their sins.

71
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,100
You're harsh.

72
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,220
A sin is a sin.

73
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,180
Dammit!!!

74
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,060
They took it away!!!

75
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,440
Help me... someone...

76
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,820
Mom... Mom...

77
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,090
No way... No...

78
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,000
This isn't...

79
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,010
This isn't what I wanted!!!

80
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,970
Al... Alphonse...

81
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,100
Alphonse! Alphonse!

82
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,640
Because of me...

83
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,100
Alphonse!!!

84
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,190
Dammit... Dammit!!!

85
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,440
Give him back... He's my little brother...

86
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,200
Whether it be an arm or a leg...

87
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,530
Or even my heart! You can take it!

88
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,660
So give him back...

89
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,990
He's my only brother!!!

90
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,590
A heavenly stone that destroyed Xerxes overnight.

91
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,720
If we had this, we could get your body back...

92
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,600
Doctor, what exactly were you ordered to research?

93
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,350
The Philosopher's Stone.

94
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,900
You mustn't desire such a thing.

95
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,980
That is the Devil's research.

96
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,940
You'll see Hell if you study it.

97
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,990
"The Devil's research"...

98
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,530
"Something you mustn't desire"...

99
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,870
I resent you, Dr. Marcoh...

100
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,540
The ingredients of philosopher's stones...

101
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,000
...are live humans.

102
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,030
Fragile beings, don't you think?

103
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,530
They cower at the darkness and don't try to stand up to it.

104
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:25,210
And instead, they try to forget it temporarily and try to escape from reality.

105
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,330
Humans are such weak creatures.

106
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:37,550
Well, let's have them be of some use
to us as a precious resource.

107
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,180
Eh, Hohenheim?

108
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:57,360
"You may be able to reach
the real truth that is beyond truth"...

109
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,950
What the heck is this?

110
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,700
Could it be what's used to transmute philosopher's stones?

111
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,790
Let's see how good you are.

112
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,130
Looks like that arm saved your life!

113
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:20,510
But my beloved sword even slices through steel!

114
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:47,790
Brother!

115
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,290
It's shameful, but we lost.

116
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,630
You're not going to say something like, "Hey, we're actually a trio", are ya?

117
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,630
We won't, we won't.

118
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,970
Just destroy us already, boy.

119
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,390
Spare me from having to murder someone.

120
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,720
You consider us human?

121
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:15,270
If I didn't accept you two as human,
it would mean I'm doing the same to my brother, too.

122
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,240
My little brother is human.

123
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,950
And so are you two.

124
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,030
That's why I don't want to kill you.

125
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,870
Brother?

126
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:36,420
Us two have been stealing, destroying,
and murdering ever since we came of age.

127
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,840
And we're being treated as humans for the first time, after being turned into this?

128
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,510
Interesting.

129
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,810
I'll tell you everything as a parting gift, boy.

130
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:53,100
The one who created the philosopher's stone and told us to guard this place is...

131
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,360
That was close.

132
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:03,070
You can't be saying out things like that, 48.

133
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,200
You're so annoying, dumbass!

134
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,000
You guys were about to kill a precious sacrifice!

135
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,210
Don't you understand?!

136
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,880
Who the hell are you two?!

137
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,880
What plan?!

138
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,170
What do you mean by sacrifice?!

139
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,430
You're a human sacrifice, right?

140
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,430
Y-Yeah, that's right. I'm a human sacrifice!

141
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,520
What the heck does he mean by that?

142
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,940
...and perhaps their master, too... may also be a suitable sacrifice

143
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,900
I'm sorry.

144
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,860
You're a candidate for sacrifice,

145
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,450
but you're going to die here.

146
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:48,320
I've been thinking for some time..

147
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,870
...as to what you mean by "human sacrifice"...

148
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,250
...and about what you are trying to make me do..

149
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,550
Riots throughout Lior.

150
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,050
The ingredients of philosopher's stone are humans...

151
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,430
What we did in Ishval...

152
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,430
Whoa now, who's the mastermind behind all of this?

153
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,520
What you are trying to do right now...

154
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,150
...is to create a giant transmutation circle, using this country and its people.

155
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,530
And the purpose of that...

156
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,070
...is to create a philosopher's stone. Am I right?

157
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,800
Could it be that you actually knew?

158
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,800
Hohenheim.

159
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,260
Why didn't you tell anyone?

160
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,050
Hohenheim!

161
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:57,850
Even if I had, would that have changed anything?

162
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:58,940
What?

163
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,860
I've been watching them for some time.

164
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:11,620
The humans who continue to repeat the same mistakes without end.

165
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:18,460
And the same humans who had to helplessly escape from their actions.

166
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:27,260
Humans are fragile creatures.

167
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,010
I thought I told you.

168
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,720
The philosopher's stone is my core.

169
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,720
I'm a homunculus.

170
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,060
You've heard of them, have you?

171
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,480
Humans that were created artificially.

172
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,690
That's what I am.

173
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,490
We're all going to die here anyway.

174
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,860
I'll show you something cool as a final gift.

175
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,460
Can I eat him?

176
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,380
Mustang!!!

177
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:16,260
The monster was keeping another monster inside its belly!

178
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,230
It swallowed everything around him!

179
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,730
So even something like this is created...

180
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,230
...by alchemy...

181
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,730
Who are you, old man?

182
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:40,500
Just as you have an ultimate shield,

183
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,330
I have an ultimate eye.

184
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,890
Oh, now I get it, Hughes...

185
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,770
When you said that the army was in danger...

186
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,270
...you didn't mean a crisis was approaching the army...

187
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,690
You meant that the army itself was in a crisis.

188
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,450
Father? You have a dad?

189
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,280
I do.

190
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,160
The one who created the Homunculi?

191
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,000
Yes.

192
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,760
Humans don't have an ultimate spear or an ultimate shield.

193
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:40,930
Nevertheless, the most trivial things get the best of them, making them unable to get back up.

194
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:49,980
What can creatures like that do against homunculi?

195
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,860
Even so, we won't give up!

196
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,780
We wouldn't give up for the world!

197
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,790
That's also a human trait, isn't it?

198
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,880
How can you even move with that wound?!

199
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,670
I sealed it with fire!

200
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,880
Although I almost fainted a few times.

201
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,140
No matter how many times you try, you can't win.

202
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:28,940
How about you tell me the secret now?

203
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,570
Thanks for that.

204
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,820
The blood that was all up in my head went away, and I can think clearly now.

205
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,120
You're still going to resist?

206
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,460
Let this put you to sleep!

207
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:59,890
This body comes with many inconveniences.

208
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,060
But inconveniences don't make me miserable!

209
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,350
There's no reason for you to pity me!

210
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,650
My life was put together with alchemy by my brother.

211
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:15,610
If I deny myself, that would mean that I'm denying brother, along with alchemy.

212
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:19,780
I believe in the potential that alchemy holds.

213
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,910
I want to believe in it!

214
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,490
A State Alchemist!

215
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,380
Get down!

216
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,050
Hang in there...

217
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,390
Don't die!

218
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,690
D-Dammit... It won't stop bleeding...

219
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,560
Someone...

220
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,030
Live...

221
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,910
You can't die.

222
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,330
Lan Fan!

223
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,170
Run!

224
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,210
Lan Fan!!!

225
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,960
My left arm is...

226
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,510
What's wrong?!

227
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,050
Young Master!

228
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,550
I can no longer be of any use to you!

229
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,220
Lan Fan?!

230
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,560
Don't do it!

231
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,060
Well played.

232
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,070
No matter how many times we're stepped on...
No matter how many times we fall...

233
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,820
We'll get back up and keep walking.

234
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,910
And someday...

235
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,870
That's just a useless struggle.

236
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,370
You don't know until you try!

237
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:52,120
It's better than not doing anything at all!

238
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,460
Are you fine with that?!

239
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,420
If Ed, Al, and everyone else disappears?!

240
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,640
Why are you getting so worked up?

241
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:14,060
Even if we do work for the sake of the humans,

242
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,440
they'll just end up dying in the end.

243
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,190
It all becomes wasted effort on our side.

244
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:30,120
In that case, don't you think it's wiser to simply grab what's important and run away?

245
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,790
What did y-

246
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,710
A bit of your conscience?

247
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,330
Or a worthless sentiment?

248
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,000
Eh, Hohenheim?

249
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:47,760
No matter how hard you try,
no one will accept you anymore!

250
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,680
Just look at your own face!

251
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,730
Humans are nothing but a resource to be used.

252
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,740
And if you leave them be, they'll renew themselves.

253
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,070
Why would you need to do anything?

254
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:12,160
Would that change anything?

255
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,210
Would you be able to change reality?!

256
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,290
Would you be able to change how these weak humans are?!

257
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:33,720
We can change.

258
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:35,890
We'll be able to change.

259
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,390
I'm sure of it.

260
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,110
We really are weak creatures,

261
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:46,200
but that's why we can strive to become stronger.

262
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,740
Even if you feel it's useless,

263
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,370
each step we take leads to something great.

264
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,710
A subordinate protects their subordinate, and so forth.

265
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,800
That should be possible, even for us puny humans.

266
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,630
No... I wasn't prepared enough.

267
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,930
Lan Fan was more prepared than I was.

268
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,310
Seeing people die before my eyes...

269
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,480
I hate it! I'm tired of it!

270
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,150
I'm not going to let anyone die anymore! I'll protect you!

271
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,310
No way in hell am I going to run!

272
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:28,780
After I beat the shit out of that "truth" guy, I'm going to drag your body out of there!

273
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,610
Al!

274
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,780
Al! Come here!

275
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,790
Hurry up! Al!!!

276
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,790
Alphonse!

277
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,630
Alphonse!

278
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,210
Alphonse!

279
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,670
Wait for me.

280
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,970
That's why I'm sure we'll be able to change.

281
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:55,640
Because we're weak... and because death is inevitable...

282
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,980
Humans try their best to live and end up becoming stronger.

283
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:04,480
If your heart is still hesitating...

284
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,400
Try to remember.

285
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,620
The days you spent in Resembool with us.

286
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:01,830
A dream, huh...

287
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,020
Thanks for everything.

288
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:38,290
Even if we part and meet again, I want to meet at this place.

289
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:38,290
Megurimeguttemo mata koko de aitai

290
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:45,220
Then we'll hold hands to ensure we'll never be separated again.

291
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:45,220
Hagurenaiyouni kono te wo tsunagunda

292
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,850
We used to talk all night until the sun rose,

293
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,850
Asahi ga noboru made katariattane

294
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:50,680
And held hands till the sun went under the horizon.

295
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:50,680
Yuuhi ga shizumu made tsunaida te

296
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:55,930
Let's walk together like this forever, like light and shadow.

297
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:55,930
Kouyatte asu mo asatte mo tomo ni ayumou hikari to kage

298
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:00,480
I stand in the city, staring off into space with lonely eyes.

299
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:00,480
Samishige ni mitsumeru machi no naka de

300
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,820
I can't find warmth on my own.

301
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,820
Nukumori wa hitori ja mitsukaranakute

302
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:11,330
By meeting you, I realized

303
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:11,330
Ai ga konnani tsuyosa ni narukoto

304
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:17,160
How much strength love could give me.

305
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:17,160
Shittanda kimi ni deaete hajimete

306
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:22,420
Even if we part and meet again, I want to meet at this place.

307
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:22,420
Megurimeguttemo mata koko de aitai

308
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:27,720
Then we'll hold hands to ensure we'll never be separated again.

309
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:27,720
Hagurenaiyouni kono te wo tsunagunda

310
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,930
I can't sleep by myself, 'cause I can't dream without you.

311
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,930
Hitori ja nemurenai yume wa mirenaikara

312
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:38,690
Donna fuan mo todokanai tokoro e

313
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:38,690
So take me to a place where uncertainty can't reach us

314
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:43,940
And let us bring light to the night sky with no stars.

315
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:43,940
Hoshi no yoru mo terashitsuzukeyou

316
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,440
So long as you're with me, I can go to world's end.

317
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,440
Doko made mo yukeru kimi to nara

318
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,450
Even if it's a path I can't walk on my own,

319
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,450
Hitori ja arukenai michi mo futari nara

320
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:52,490
If you're by my side, I can walk it while humming a tune.

321
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:52,490
Hanauta utainagara arukerunda

322
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:55,910
Kimi ga ireba shiawase

323
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:55,910
If we're together, the world is mine.

324
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:03,950
If you'll cower at the sight of the great foe before you,

325
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,540
leave at once, coward.

326
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,750
If you'll lose the strength you believed in,

327
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,380
then fall to the ground, weakling.

328
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,840
Now is the time for the decisive battle.

329
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,220
Humans, give it all you have.
