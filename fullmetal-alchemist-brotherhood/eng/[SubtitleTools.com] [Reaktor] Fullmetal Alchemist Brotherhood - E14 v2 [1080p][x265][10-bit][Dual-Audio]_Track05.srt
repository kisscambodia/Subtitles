1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,890
I've still got a lot of years ahead of me

2
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,890
Kono omoi wo keshiteshimau niwa

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:05,810
To just erase these feelings?

4
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:05,900
Mada jinsei nagai desho?

5
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:05,850
To just erase these feelings?

6
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:05,900
To just erase these feelings?

7
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,900
I want to go back and finish

8
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,900
Yarinokoshiteru koto

9
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,530
The things that I've yet to finish.

10
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,530
Yarinaoshite mitai kara

11
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:28,790
Yume no tsuzuki oikaketeita hazu nanoni

12
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:28,790
I was supposed to be chasing after my ongoing dream,

13
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:35,130
Yet I faltered over others while walking this thin, winding path.

14
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:35,130
Magarikunetta hosoi michi hito ni tsumazuku

15
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,300
It's not that I want to return to those days.

16
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,300
Ano koro mitainitte modoritai wake ja nai no

17
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,810
I'm searching for the sky I lost.

18
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,810
Nakushitekita sora wo sagashiteru

19
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,480
Don't make that sad face, as if you've fallen victim.

20
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,480
Wakatte kuremasu youni

21
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,690
As if you want people to pity you.

22
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,690
Gisei ni natta youna kanashii kao wa yameteyo

23
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,400
Tears aren't the end of your sins.

24
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,400
Tsumi no saigo wa namida ja nai yo

25
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,070
You have to bear them painfully, forever.

26
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,070
Zutto kurushiku seottekunda

27
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,740
Who are you waiting for in the maze of emotions,

28
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,740
Deguchi mienai kanjoumeiro ni

29
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,400
Where you can't even see the exit?

30
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,400
Dare wo matteruno?

31
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,200
I want to blurt it out more justly,

32
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,200
Shiroi nooto ni tsuzutta youni

33
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,950
Motto sunao ni hakidashitai yo

34
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,950
Just like how I wrote it in my white notebook.

35
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,620
What do you want to run from?

36
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,620
Nani kara nogaretainda

37
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,240
That thing called "reality"?

38
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,240
Genjitsu tte yatsu?

39
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,580
I just want to scream out,

40
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,580
Kanaeru tame ni ikiterundatte

41
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,000
"I'm only living to fulfill my wish." Can you hear me?

42
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,000
Sakebitaku naru yo kikoeteimasuka?

43
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,130
I can't take the safe way out of everything.

44
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,130
Bunan ni nante yatterarenaikara

45
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,920
Kaeru basho mo nai no

46
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,920
I don't even have a place to return to.

47
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,220
I'm always thankful for everyone's kindness,

48
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,220
Yasashisa ni wa itsumo kansha shiteru

49
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,600
That's why I want to become stronger. (I'm on the way)

50
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,600
Dakara tsuyoku naritai (I'm on the way)

51
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,560
This is reminding me of the old days.

52
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,560
Natsukashiku naru

53
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,810
This pain is all right with me.

54
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,810
Konna itami mo kangei jan

55
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,560
So that's Roy Mustang.

56
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,280
The Flame Alchemist, eh?

57
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,160
An exceptional promotion at that age?
I wonder what kind of connections he used.

58
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,160
They say the faster you rise, the faster you fall.

59
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,330
Come in.

60
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,040
Sorry to bother you.

61
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,050
I am Colonel Roy Mustang.

62
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,510
Ah, Colonel Mustang.

63
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,930
I apologize. The Führer President is out right now.

64
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,270
To where?

65
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,940
He went to the South for an inspection.

66
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,060
South?

67
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,870
I don't like this smell.

68
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,580
But it smells familiar.

69
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,750
This is...

70
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,290
I simply came for an inspection,
but it seems I just discovered something.

71
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,330
Those Who Lurk
Underground

72
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,090
Move in!

73
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,850
A brat and a housewife?! How grand.

74
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,190
But I'm kind of ill-matched for a fight.

75
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,980
I'll be making my escape.

76
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,860
You-

77
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,070
M-Master, hang in there!

78
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,700
Running away?! How cowardly...

79
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,990
Master...

80
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,000
Master! Master!!!

81
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,220
Stay...

82
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,640
...still...

83
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,220
N...o...

84
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,190
Greed!

85
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,690
Looks like you're okay, Martel.

86
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,690
What happened? I haven't seen Roa and the others, either...

87
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,700
Yeah, things have become a little complicated.

88
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,280
We have to get out of here somehow.

89
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,450
I can't let you do that.

90
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,700
Huh? Who are you, old man?

91
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,290
Führer President!

92
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,710
Why are you here?

93
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,460
King Bradley?!

94
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,210
So what business does the most powerful guy in the country have with us?

95
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,300
How old are you?

96
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,510
Huh?

97
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,010
I'm turning sixty this year.

98
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,270
When you get old, your body starts to not move the way you want it to.

99
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,730
So I really want to get this over with and go home.

100
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,650
Retire already, gramps.

101
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,700
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're not just an ordinary geezer, are you?!

102
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,880
Greed?!

103
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,140
Now you've seen it.

104
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,310
A skill that has been passed down in the Armstrong household for generations... Sculpture Alchemy!!!

105
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,530
In that case, I won't hold back.

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,040
How strange...

107
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,760
We've ensured the safety of the boy and the housewife.

108
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,430
We'll proceed with the extermination of all the monsters!

109
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,230
It's an order from the Führer President!

110
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,960
It's been a while since anyone's gotten me so excited.

111
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,920
Nothing less to be expected from Sir Armstrong.

112
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,470
I also participated in the Ishbal extermination.

113
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,300
Former ally, eh?

114
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,390
Then all the more reason not to kill you.

115
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,020
Surrender at once.

116
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,060
Even though you're planning on killing me?

117
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,270
Major!

118
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:36,900
Roa!

119
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,250
Bastard!!!

120
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,750
You see,

121
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,260
I don't have an ultimate shield like you,

122
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:01,430
nor an ultimate spear that pierces diamond.

123
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,770
Do you understand how someone like that could have survived countless battles,

124
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:11,770
rendered distinguished service,
and has achieved the rank I have right now?

125
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,610
Y...ou...

126
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,450
Just as you have an ultimate shield,

127
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,790
I have an ultimate eye.

128
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,210
Now, Greed.

129
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,720
How many times do I have to kill you to get rid of you for good?

130
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,180
Where's Greed?

131
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,430
I don't know.

132
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,560
It's too dark; I can't see anything.

133
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,120
Greed?!

134
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,990
No!

135
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,250
Hey! Open up!

136
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,040
No!

137
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,160
Let me out!

138
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,420
I said no!

139
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,880
That was fifteen deaths, wasn't it?

140
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,340
How many more do you have? Hmm?

141
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,420
Y-You bastard...

142
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,760
Dammit...

143
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,260
The Führer President himself is here?

144
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,060
I don't mind if you run off with your tail between your legs.

145
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,430
I'd love to,

146
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,890
but dogs are loyal animals.

147
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,650
Please, get her out of here.

148
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,900
We're counting on you.

149
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,120
Roa?! Dolcetto?!

150
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,710
Hey, quit interfering! Let me out!

151
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,580
I won't!

152
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,960
I don't have time to mess with you!

153
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,750
I'm telling you to open up!

154
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,960
No! You can't come out!

155
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,130
Shut up and open up!

156
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,640
Are you telling me to just sit and watch my friends be killed?!

157
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,640
I can't let you out!

158
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,140
They asked me to keep you safe!

159
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,390
Dolcetto!!!

160
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,070
Roa!!!

161
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,860
Please, I'm begging you...

162
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,450
You can't... come out.

163
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,580
Hey, hey, Mister Bradley.

164
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,000
You really think you'll get away with doing this to my men?

165
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,960
You're feeling sympathetic now? How silly.

166
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,380
Sympathy?

167
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,840
Are you stupid?

168
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,510
Who do you think I am?

169
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,220
I'm Greed.

170
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,350
Money, women, subordinates...

171
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,600
...everything belongs to me!

172
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,730
Which is why I won't abandon what's mine.

173
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,110
I'm a greedy guy, after all!!!

174
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:05,400
Greedy? This is beyond silly.

175
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,130
How about you lie there for a while.

176
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:24,800
I have to get out of here...

177
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,680
Hang on.

178
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,640
You're Edward's brother, aren't you?

179
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,310
Are you hurt? Let me lend you a hand.

180
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:36,140
N-No, I'm fine.

181
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,270
I can go back by myself.

182
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,030
No, Martel!

183
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,450
No, Martel!

184
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,750
Bradley!!!

185
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,470
Al!!!

186
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,500
M-Mom!

187
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,340
Mom! Mom!!!

188
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,810
Al! Hang in there!

189
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,400
Hey, say something!

190
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,690
Al!

191
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:05,980
Brother...

192
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:07,730
You all right?

193
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:11,400
You're covered in blood, too, Brother...

194
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:23,170
I opened you up and pulled her body out.

195
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,000
I couldn't save her...

196
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,880
It's not your fault.

197
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,640
Come on. Let's go back.

198
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:37,850
Al...

199
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,980
Hold there.

200
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,980
I've got something I need to ask you both.

201
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:54,700
The mastermind of this incident, Greed. Is he an acquaintance of yours?

202
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,320
No, sir.

203
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,080
Did you happen to obtain
any important information from him?

204
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,170
Nothing that would benefit the army, no.

205
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:08,040
Don't misunderstand me. Not for the army.

206
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,800
If you were making a deal with them...

207
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,340
...depending on your answer...

208
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,890
Did you ally yourself with people whose intent was to harm the mainstay of the army?

209
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,310
No, sir.

210
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,810
Any other questions?

211
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,480
Your steel arm and your brother's body.

212
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,400
They're related, are they not?

213
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,990
You're an honest one.

214
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,040
Time to withdraw.

215
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:49,210
Take good care of your little brother, you hear?

216
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,510
I deeply appreciate you saving those two boys.

217
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,350
Don't worry about it.

218
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,810
It's one of the duties of the army to protect State Alchemists, too.

219
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,890
How about it?

220
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,440
Would you like to be protected by the army, too?

221
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,440
Become a State Alchemist?

222
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,240
Precisely.

223
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:19,820
As you can see, I'm a frail housewife.

224
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,500
Is this country so strained as to require the help of someone like me?

225
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,500
Harsh words!

226
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,130
I'll come again.

227
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,430
You may have changed your mind by then.

228
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:57,200
That Greed guy had a tattoo of Ouroboros on his hand.

229
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,030
Ouroboros...

230
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:02,740
You heard me telling Lt. Colonel Hughes, didn't you?

231
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,540
They're people who have something to do with the philosopher's stones.

232
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,210
Sir Hughes...

233
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,420
Edward Elric.

234
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,800
Don't do anything too reckless, all right?

235
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,510
Okay...

236
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,430
Well then...

237
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,270
Brother.

238
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:42,120
My memories of when my body was taken have returned.

239
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,530
How was it?!

240
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,290
Well...

241
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,250
It was kind of extraordinary...

242
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,500
But I couldn't find anything about human transmutation.

243
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,500
I see...

244
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,380
In the end, no progress, eh...

245
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,970
Not necessarily.

246
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,760
Remember what the Führer President said?

247
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,230
That there have been disquieting activities within the military.

248
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:15,110
Yeah, he said that it had something to do with philosopher's stones and the people who have tattoos of Ouroboros...

249
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:18,030
He said he wanted to catch them for that reason, right?

250
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:22,160
Greed also had that tattoo.

251
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:26,530
If so, why did he need to kill them all?

252
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:32,040
If he really wanted to know what they were up to,
he should have captured and interrogated them, right?

253
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,880
You're right.

254
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:39,380
And besides, it's strange the Führer President himself came to the battlefield when there weren't that many enemies.

255
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:43,800
Yeah. Everything just seems so fishy.

256
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:48,260
Guess we'll stick with the army for a little longer.

257
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,570
Welcome back, Führer President.

258
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,690
How did the inspection of the South go?

259
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,070
The Fullmetal Alchemist's brother...

260
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,870
...and perhaps their master, too.

261
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:11,200
Both of them may also be suitable sacrifices.

262
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,420
I also found something else that was unexpected.

263
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,500
Oh my, now that's someone I haven't seen in a while.

264
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,420
He left this place a century ago.

265
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,590
Wake up, Greed.

266
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,510
Oh wow, looks like everyone's here.

267
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,600
So much for your ultimate shield.

268
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:36,350
You look as gorgeous as you did a century ago.

269
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:40,360
Miss Lust, the "Ultimate Spear".

270
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,110
And Gluttony, you haven't lost weight at all.

271
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:50,740
And, Envy? You still dress like that?

272
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,830
Where's Sloth at?

273
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,380
He always skips out on meetings.

274
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,000
He's working right now.

275
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,840
Seriously, none of you guys have changed over a hundred years.

276
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,310
And who's this guy?

277
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,810
I am Wrath.

278
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,520
Wrath?

279
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,350
Aren't you King Bradley?

280
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:26,320
Yup. He's our last sibling Father created as a human by the name of King Bradley.

281
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,120
An aging Homunculus?!

282
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,830
Is that even possible?

283
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,660
"There's no way there's no way."

284
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,460
I thought that was a stock phrase of yours. Don't tell me you forgot?

285
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,460
Or are you going senile?

286
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,550
Shut your mouth, you ugly shit.

287
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,670
What was that?

288
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:48,630
Hey, I like those eyes. That's the way you ought to be.

289
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:52,850
How about you show your true colors every once in a while, Envy the Bizarre.

290
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:54,180
You piece of shit...

291
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,600
I'll kick your ass, if that's what you're asking for.

292
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,610
Cut it out, all of you.

293
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:10,280
Please don't fight among siblings, especially in front of your father.

294
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,830
Yo, old man.

295
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:16,450
Looks like you've aged a lot since the last time I saw you.

296
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,290
Greed.

297
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,670
You are my son who shares my soul.

298
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,960
Why did you betray me?

299
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,670
"Why"?

300
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:31,640
Shouldn't you know best?

301
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,260
I am Greed.

302
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,980
That's how you gave me life, and that's the way I've lived.

303
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:43,230
If I stayed by your side, I wouldn't be able to obtain everything my greedy soul desires.

304
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,740
Will you work for me again?

305
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,240
No can do!

306
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,370
I see...

307
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,970
I really don't like your tastes...

308
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,890
This is how hot I like my baths, damnit!

309
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:26,400
I'm sure the flames of Hell are hotter than this!

310
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:32,410
I'll go on ahead to see what it's like, my siblings!

311
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:40,410
Go back to where you came from, my soul, Greed!

312
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,370
You don't even have to ask!!!

313
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:46,420
Don't blame me if you get a stomachache, old man!!!

314
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,860
To the forthcoming day,

315
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:10,360
I pray for the unchanging loyalty of you all, along with peace and order.

316
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,580
Dad!

317
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,090
Welcome back, Dad!

318
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,590
Thank you, Selim.

319
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,050
How was the inspection?

320
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:41,140
It was a substantial inspection all right.

321
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,480
Dear, you're getting older...

322
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,060
Why not give up your position to a junior and relax?

323
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:51,110
No, no, I'm still in my prime.

324
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,360
Oh, that's right. I met the
Fullmetal Alchemist while in the South.

325
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,990
The short alchemist? Really?!

326
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:03,750
You really love hearing about Mr. Edward, don't you, Selim?

327
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:08,540
He's the youngest State Alchemist! That's just so cool!

328
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:14,050
That's awesome. I want to learn alchemy, too!

329
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,380
What in the world would you do with it?

330
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,050
I want to get a state qualification to be useful to Dad.

331
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:25,520
Then I might ask for your help in the future.

332
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:33,070
Ano hi mita sora akaneiro no sora wo

333
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:33,070
Say, the sky we saw that day, the scarlet sky.

334
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:38,280
Do you remember it from that day?

335
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:38,280
Nee kimi wa oboeteimasuka

336
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:44,200
We made a promise and a vow while the early summer wind circled us.

337
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:44,200
Yakusoku chigiri shoka no kaze ga tsutsumu

338
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,460
And we clung close together.

339
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,460
Futari yorisotta

340
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,510
Your forced smile

341
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,510
Muri na egao no ura

342
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:02,890
Holds elongated shadows.

343
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:02,890
Nobita kage wo kakumau

344
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:12,150
I pretend not to notice and continue on.

345
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:12,150
Dakara kizukanu furi saisei wo erabu

346
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:21,660
All the while waiting for you to deliver some news at the table.

347
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:21,660
Teeburu no ue no furuenai shirase machitsuzukete

348
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:30,040
Empty nights, mornings that will never arrive,

349
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:30,040
Kuuhaku no yoru mo kuru hazu no nai asa mo

350
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:34,800
I could see them from a mile away.

351
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:34,800
Zenbu wakattetanda

352
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:40,430
Say, the sky we saw that day, the scarlet sky.

353
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:40,430
Ano hi mita sora akaneiro no sora wo

354
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:45,350
Nee itsuka omoidasu deshou

355
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:45,350
I'm sure you'll remember it one day.

356
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:51,190
While holding the promise we couldn't keep,

357
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:51,190
Hatasenakatta yakusoku wo idaite

358
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:55,440
We take our first steps down our own paths.

359
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:55,440
Futari arukidasu

360
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:07,190
The pebbles foreigners throw into the water create ripples, and as they link together, they create a huge whirlpool.

361
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:10,530
Look! That's precisely what's happening right now.

362
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:16,120
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

363
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,620
The Envoy from
the East

364
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,620
Episode 15, Envoy From the East.

365
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:25,880
I hide my blade behind my smile
and seek the Philosopher's Stone.
