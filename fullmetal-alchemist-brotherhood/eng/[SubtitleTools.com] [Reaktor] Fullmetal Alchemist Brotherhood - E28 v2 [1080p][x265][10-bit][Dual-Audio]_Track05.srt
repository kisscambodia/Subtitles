1
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,870
Can't focus. My body is still puzzled about what to do.

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,870
Shuuchuu dekitenaina mada karada ga mayotteirunda

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,630
I'm trembling. I can't stop even if I try to control myself.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,630
Furueteitanja kontoroorushitatte burerunda

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,380
Although neither sun nor moon are on my side,

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,380
Taiyou mo tsuki mo nanmo kanzen ni kocchi muiteinaiga

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,800
"I've no choice but to try,"

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,800
Yarushikanainda

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,470
Those were the words I muttered to myself.

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,470
Iikikaseruyouni sotto tsubuyaita

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,060
The odds aren't on my side, but running way'd be gutless.

12
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,060
Joukyou wa waruiga tada nigedasunja konjou nainaa

13
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,060
Even if I can't see the future, I'll just have to win it over with courage.

14
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,060
Tenbou wa naiga dokyou de kuria suru shika naiya

15
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,560
Need to keep distance from the target as I hold myself back.

16
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,560
Shoudou wa osaetamama taagetto to no kankaku sagure

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,860
All that's needed for victory is pride to win.

18
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,860
Hitsuyou na mon wa katsu puraido

19
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,950
Will we celebrate with the wine of victory

20
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,950
Ajiwau nowa shouri no bishu ka

21
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,950
Or'll we end up kissing their feet in defeat?

22
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,950
Soretomo haiboku no kujuu ka

23
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,700
There are two outcomes to everything.

24
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,700
Sou subete wa futatsu ni hitotsu

25
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,420
Ayatsuritai unmei no ito

26
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,420
I want to control destiny.

27
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,750
I need to seize the golden opportunity with my hands.

28
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,750
Zekkou no goorudentaimu kono te de tsukame

29
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,840
I'll finish it up with my best poker face,

30
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,840
Konshin no pookaafeisu kimete shikakeruyo

31
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,800
And drag them into a world of illusions.

32
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,800
Iryuujon no sekai e hikizurikonde

33
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,140
I'll find my way out of this endless pressure game,

34
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,140
Saigennai puresshaageemu sururito nukete

35
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,150
And leap over the borderline of honor.

36
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,150
Eikou no boodaarain tobikoeru tameni

37
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,860
Haumenii? Dorekurai no daishou ga iru?

38
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,860
How many? What'll I need to sacrifice to make it happen?

39
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,120
What is the one thing I don't want to let go?

40
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,120
Tebanashitakunai mon wa dore?

41
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,080
I've got a bad feeling about this place.

42
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,830
Father! I brought a sacrifice!

43
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,420
"Father"? So suddenly...

44
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,920
Who is it?

45
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,930
Dad?

46
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,460
Father

47
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,840
Envy.

48
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,300
Envy?!

49
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,010
This is him?!

50
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:52,770
Brother!

51
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,310
Brother!

52
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,400
Al?

53
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,070
Al in the armor... which means...

54
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,070
We were able to get back.

55
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,410
Yeah.

56
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,490
Brother!

57
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,660
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

58
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,330
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

59
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,290
I'm so glad to see you're safe!

60
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,410
That hurts, Al!

61
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,790
Your armor's hurting me!

62
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:24,090
It's just that I'm so glad to see you're alive...

63
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,630
You're right.

64
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,840
Sorry.

65
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,350
For worrying you.

66
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,100
But where the heck are we?

67
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,110
What a surprise.

68
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,440
Humans came out of his stomach?

69
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,030
Hohen...heim?!

70
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,580
An arm and a leg made of steel, and a suit of armor.

71
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,670
Are you the Elric Brothers?

72
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,750
It's not him?

73
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,300
Are you mistaking me for somebody?

74
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,050
Hang on...

75
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,050
Hohen...

76
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:13,550
Don't tell me you're talking about Van Hohenheim?

77
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,810
What is your relationship with him?

78
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,060
He's... our dad.

79
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,310
Dad?!

80
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,780
What a surprise! He ended up having kids?!

81
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:36,620
But aren't your last names Elric?

82
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,620
Elric is our mother's maiden name!

83
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,750
I see.

84
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,330
So, where is he now?

85
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,750
Hell if I know!

86
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,130
But more importantly, who the hell are you?!

87
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,050
You look just like Hohenheim!

88
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,260
There's no way he'd die.

89
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,680
Listen to me!

90
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,720
And he's even had kids...

91
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,260
Brother, this man is...

92
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,470
Oh? You're injured?

93
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,640
And you're missing your left arm.

94
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,400
How's that?

95
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:07,480
Ow!

96
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,320
A broken bone, huh?

97
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,120
I-It's fixed.

98
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,410
Hey!

99
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,790
Oww!

100
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,630
Now for your ribs.

101
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,050
You two are important to us.

102
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,140
Don't be too reckless with your bodies, okay?

103
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,850
He used alchemy without a single hand motion.

104
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,100
And he didn't make the rest of my armor thinner, either...

105
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,980
In other words, it's not equivalent exchange.

106
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,980
Who the hell are you?

107
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,990
It's unreal! How could your insides be in such a state?!

108
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,610
I'm going to ask you the same exact question.

109
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,990
Who are you?

110
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,700
You can eat him.

111
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,750
Okay!

112
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,910
H-Hang on!

113
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,080
He's my friend!

114
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,380
I'm a human sacrifice, so don't kill him for my sake. Okay?

115
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,460
That's not my problem.

116
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,590
He's useless to me.

117
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,010
What did you say?!

118
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,350
Brother, the Homunculi call him "Father".

119
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,600
He's the one who created them.

120
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,560
What?!

121
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,980
Even though he patched us up...

122
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,110
I don't like it.

123
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,690
Your attitude...

124
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,240
You're the same as those who laugh at humans for being foolish.

125
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,280
Do you consider insects crawling about the Earth to be foolish?

126
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:46,420
Even if insects struggle, the difference between you and them is so great that you don't exactly give a damn.

127
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,550
That's precisely how I feel about you humans.

128
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,430
I appreciate you healing our wounds,
but I don't think I can get along with you!

129
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,970
Seems you're the cause of everything!

130
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,220
I'll take care of you quickly.

131
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,350
I can't be worrying about the small fry!

132
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,190
You're calling me small fry now, runt?

133
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,770
Runt?!

134
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,030
I've got their leader!

135
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,960
Ling!

136
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,800
What is going on?!

137
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,760
How can he use alchemy without a single hand motion?!

138
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,350
What a waste of time.

139
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,090
We can't use alchemy?!

140
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,470
Ed! Al!

141
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,520
What did that geezer do?!

142
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,400
Why...

143
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,940
Why can't we use alchemy?!

144
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,450
Seriously, these tiny beings are unbelievable.

145
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,990
They start to think they're at the top of the world as soon as they gain some power.

146
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,200
They don't even know what exactly they're using.

147
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:52,790
Do you really think all this prosperity was created with the powers of humans only?

148
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,000
How laughable, fools.

149
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,630
What the hell are you talking about?!

150
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,590
You promised you'd tell me as soon as we got out!

151
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,760
What?

152
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,930
I don't remember making promises with you insects.

153
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,060
You bastard...

154
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,600
You're talking too much, Envy.

155
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,770
Yeah, yeah...

156
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,690
He could be good for the job.

157
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,570
I may be able to create another pawn.

158
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,080
That's... a philosopher's stone!

159
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,200
What?!

160
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,460
So you're planning to do it, huh?

161
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,460
Do what?

162
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,830
He's creating a Homunculus.

163
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,170
He's going to inject the philosopher's stone into him.

164
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:44,050
If all goes well, a homunculus with a human base will be complete.

165
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,640
Well, most humans end up dying because they aren't capable of fighting the stone's power.

166
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,560
Like I'll let you!

167
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,110
Let go, Envy!!

168
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,570
Dammit, what's going on?!

169
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,530
Why can't we use alchemy?!

170
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,410
Hey, you!

171
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,780
Geezer! Stop it!

172
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,620
He has people waiting for his return!

173
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,240
Let go!!!

174
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,790
Humans can't shoot me if I do this...

175
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,630
Right?

176
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,090
Damn you...

177
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,470
It's fine! Don't shoot!

178
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,470
Don't interfere.

179
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,640
This is fine by me!

180
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,890
What?

181
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,890
I came to this country looking for a philosopher's stone.

182
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,350
And he's just going to give it to me like that.

183
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,900
It's exactly what I wished for!

184
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,270
What the hell are you saying?!

185
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,770
Oh? Sounds interesting.

186
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,530
Then as you wish, it's all yours.

187
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,320
Stop it!

188
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,370
Ling!

189
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,170
I... I told you not...

190
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,000
...to interfere!

191
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,680
It's fine... Just wait for me...

192
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,270
I'm the man who will become the Emperor of Xing...

193
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,480
...Ling Yao!

194
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,370
What the hell is a brat doing here?!

195
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,330
Ah, well.

196
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,340
Let me have your body.

197
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,050
I'll put it to good use.

198
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,340
Fine...

199
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,550
It's all yours!

200
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,550
What?

201
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,180
I'm saying that I'll accept you!

202
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,180
Wouldn't people normally be against it?

203
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,730
I'm going to become the Emperor of Xing.

204
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,770
How do you expect me to do that if I can't even accept a few dozen people in my body?!

205
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,440
I like decisive guys.

206
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,400
But you'd better not regret it.

207
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,160
Regret?

208
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:17,160
If I return empty-handed, how could I possibly face my servant who cut her own arm off to save me?!

209
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,040
I want power...

210
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,170
Absolute power that will help me protect and gain more!

211
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,050
I knew the risks from the beginning!

212
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,090
I like your greed.

213
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:36,850
Well then, show me how prepared you are!

214
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,190
Ling?

215
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:53,320
Huh? Oh, the guy who owned this body?

216
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,950
Sorry, but now it belongs to me, Greed.

217
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,080
Not Ling, but...

218
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,960
Greed?!

219
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:14,470
You're that Greed?

220
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,100
What do you mean by "that" Greed?

221
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,640
You don't remember?!

222
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,140
The one at Dublith...

223
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,350
Yeah, so what Greed are you talking about?

224
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:26,110
The Greed that came before you.

225
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,480
Oh, I see.

226
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,030
Well, as you can see,

227
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,410
I'm a different Greed from the one you guys know.

228
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,120
What happened to Ling?

229
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,540
He was an interesting brat.

230
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,160
He accepted me in a matter of seconds.

231
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:46,170
No way! There's no way he's that easy to take control of!

232
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,340
Answer me! Ling!

233
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,710
Ling!!!

234
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,230
What?

235
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,390
No...

236
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,650
I don't like him...

237
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,770
He's a person, but at the same time, he's not!

238
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:15,240
You're right, a lot of these guys aren't human.

239
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,780
Shao May!

240
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,790
I'm so glad to see you're safe!

241
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,660
Do you have any idea how worried I was?

242
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,790
Whoa, I don't really get it, but is this some tearful reunion?

243
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,130
It seems they aren't working together with the Homunculi.

244
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,720
Fullmetal Alchemist.

245
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,090
Huh? Where?

246
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:40,310
Where's Sir Edward?

247
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,310
Right there.

248
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,230
I don't see him anywhere!

249
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,850
I'm pointing right at him.

250
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:50,360
That small one is the Fullmetal Alchemist.

251
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:12,340
You toyed with my pure heart, you midget!

252
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,170
Speak for yourself, midget!

253
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:14,590
PLACEHOLDER

254
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:17,340
What did you do to her, Brother?!

255
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,880
He's the Ishbalan I didn't get to eat.

256
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,970
I didn't do a thing!

257
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,800
The disobedient people, huh...

258
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,390
He's the one who uses destructive alchemy and continues to interfere with our plans, right?

259
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,850
Take care of them, Gluttony.

260
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,610
He can't use alchemy right now.

261
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,610
Okay!

262
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,610
What?!

263
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,200
I'll never forgive you!

264
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,410
You stepped all over a maiden's heart,
and on top of that, you kidnapped Shao May!

265
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,830
Divine punishment...

266
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,330
...for all of you!!!

267
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,710
Lucky!

268
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,720
We still can't use it!

269
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,100
What gives?!

270
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,100
How can you two use alchemy here?

271
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,600
What do you mean?

272
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,940
Seriously, what's going on?

273
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,650
How can Scar and that little girl...

274
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:14,730
I have no idea.

275
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:16,360
No idea, but...

276
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,360
This could be our chance to fill them in.

277
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,280
Scar!

278
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,790
I'll tell you the truth behind the Ishbal rebellion!

279
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,830
The truth?

280
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,790
The death of the child which became the trigger of the rebellion...

281
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:35,500
...was caused by him, disguised as a military officer!

282
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:40,380
They're behind it all!

283
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:54,150
It seems like I'll have to ask you to explain this in detail.

284
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,530
Answer me.

285
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:06,830
Why did my people have to fall?

286
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:11,830
Depending on your answer, I'll send you to...

287
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,870
No.

288
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:17,000
I won't send you to God, where my fellow Ishbalans reside!

289
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,420
Think of yourselves as undeserving of eternal rest or redemption!!!

290
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,430
Wow, amazing!

291
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,600
Not bad for a human.

292
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,690
Greed, get rid of the intruders.

293
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,940
Yeah, yeah...

294
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,700
I refuse to believe it, Ling!

295
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,410
I'm Greed.

296
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,630
That's...

297
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:59,000
Could that be Ling from the Yao clan?

298
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,010
A little girl!

299
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,010
Soft body!

300
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:14,140
Hey you, how can you use alchemy?

301
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,860
Yes, you really are using it.

302
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,280
Human destruction...

303
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,450
No, decomposition.

304
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,040
A second later, and I would have been...

305
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,330
Mr. Scar!

306
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:46,510
Shao May... Run...

307
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,180
You're mine!

308
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:51,890
Are you okay?!

309
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,650
I never asked you to save me...

310
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,690
What are you talking about?!

311
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:04,650
They're ruthless toward humans who are of no benefit to them.

312
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,280
Hurry up and get out of here!

313
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,580
There's way too many of them!

314
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:19,000
You two didn't run away?!

315
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:29,430
Scar, could you take this girl and get out of here?

316
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,260
You're going to let me escape?

317
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,520
Even if I killed those doctors...

318
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,730
Yeah, I want to beat the hell out of you.

319
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,770
To be honest, I don't even want to ask you for any favors.

320
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:44,530
But right now, it's more important to take this girl somewhere safe.

321
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,690
What will you do?

322
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:53,620
Apparently, my brother and I are important to them in some way.

323
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:57,120
Even if we stay here, they won't kill us.

324
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:02,670
Right now, I won't be able to protect
that girl and escape from here at the same time.

325
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,300
And I don't have the slightest intention of running away, either!

326
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,180
He decomposed water?!

327
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:23,690
Geez, let me know before you do stuff like that!

328
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,360
How reckless!

329
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:31,200
Igniting hydrogen? That's clever of you.

330
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:34,780
Where is he?

331
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,830
Where did he go?!

332
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,910
I don't know!

333
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,370
Gluttony, track him by scent!

334
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,210
You're out of lives?!

335
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,670
You've died too much!

336
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,220
That was a nice kick.

337
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,800
I think this'll be more fun than I expected.

338
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,560
You stupid prince!

339
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,980
Come back to your senses!

340
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,810
I'm Greed.

341
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:02,770
I don't care!

342
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,270
Give Ling back his body.

343
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:06,610
No can do!

344
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,160
What are you, an idiot?!

345
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,910
What are you going to do about your country?!

346
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,790
What about Lan Fan?!

347
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,420
PLACEHOLDER

348
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,760
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

349
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,760
Father! I got him.

350
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:33,430
Take him upstairs, where Wrath is.

351
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,810
Seriously... Always screwing around with us...

352
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:43,640
As long as you guys behave, we won't do a thing.

353
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,940
Brother.

354
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,900
He...

355
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,650
Ling...

356
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,450
...is inside of him.

357
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:06,550
Even if we part and meet again, I want to meet at this place.

358
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:06,550
Megurimeguttemo mata koko de aitai

359
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:13,480
Then we'll hold hands to ensure we'll never be separated again.

360
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:13,480
Hagurenaiyouni kono te wo tsunagunda

361
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,110
We used to talk all night until the sun rose,

362
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,110
Asahi ga noboru made katariattane

363
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,940
And held hands till the sun went under the horizon.

364
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,940
Yuuhi ga shizumu made tsunaida te

365
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:24,190
Let's walk together like this forever, like light and shadow.

366
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:24,190
Kouyatte asu mo asatte mo tomo ni ayumou hikari to kage

367
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:28,740
I stand in the city, staring off into space with lonely eyes.

368
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:28,740
Samishige ni mitsumeru machi no naka de

369
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:34,080
I can't find warmth on my own.

370
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:34,080
Nukumori wa hitori ja mitsukaranakute

371
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,590
By meeting you, I realized

372
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,590
Ai ga konnani tsuyosa ni narukoto

373
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:45,420
How much strength love could give me.

374
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:45,420
Shittanda kimi ni deaete hajimete

375
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:50,680
Even if we part and meet again, I want to meet at this place.

376
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:50,680
Megurimeguttemo mata koko de aitai

377
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:55,980
Then we'll hold hands to ensure we'll never be separated again.

378
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:55,980
Hagurenaiyouni kono te wo tsunagunda

379
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:01,190
I can't sleep by myself, 'cause I can't dream without you.

380
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:01,190
Hitori ja nemurenai yume wa mirenaikara

381
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:06,950
So take me to a place where uncertainty can't reach us

382
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:06,950
Donna fuan mo todokanai tokoro e

383
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:12,200
And let us bring light to the night sky with no stars.

384
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:12,200
Hoshi no yoru mo terashitsuzukeyou

385
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,700
So long as you're with me, I can go to world's end.

386
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,700
Doko made mo yukeru kimi to nara

387
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,710
Even if it's a path I can't walk on my own,

388
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,710
Hitori ja arukenai michi mo futari nara

389
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,750
If you're by my side, I can walk it while humming a tune.

390
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,750
Hanauta utainagara arukerunda

391
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:24,170
Kimi ga ireba shiawase

392
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:24,170
If we're together, the world is mine.

393
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:33,750
You used up your regeneration abilities, huh?

394
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,170
Worry not, my son.

395
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,940
I will recreate you.

396
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,070
With your memories, of course.

397
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:04,060
Humans in chaos, struggle and writhe in agony.

398
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,940
Because that serves as proof that one is alive.

399
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,820
And struggle and kneel before me.

400
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,990
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

401
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:20,990
Struggle of the Fool

402
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:20,990
Episode 29, Struggle of the Fool.

403
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:26,250
Will the man who had his limbs twisted be able to stand again?
