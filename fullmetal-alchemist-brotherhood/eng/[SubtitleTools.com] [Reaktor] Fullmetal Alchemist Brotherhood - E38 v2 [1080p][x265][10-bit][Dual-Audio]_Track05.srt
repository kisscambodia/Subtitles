1
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,830
I'll always be watching you from your shadows.

2
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,260
Hello?

3
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,480
Evening! It's your favorite florist!

4
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,150
What do you want, Colonel?!

5
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,610
Sorry about that.

6
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,730
I was a bit drunk and ended up buying a lot of flowers.

7
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,070
I'd be grateful if you'd be willing to take a few off my hands.

8
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,160
What's wrong?

9
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:09,580
Did something happen?

10
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,120
No, it's nothing.

11
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,130
Are you sure?

12
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:18,460
Yes, it's nothing.

13
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,550
I'll have to kindly refuse the flowers.

14
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,930
I don't own a vase to put them in.

15
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,890
But thank you for giving me a call. Good night.

16
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,400
Why does he have such good timing when it comes to things like these?

17
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:58,890
Can't focus. My body is still puzzled about what to do.

18
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:58,890
Shuuchuu dekitenaina mada karada ga mayotteirunda

19
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,650
I'm trembling. I can't stop even if I try to control myself.

20
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,650
Furueteitanja kontoroorushitatte burerunda

21
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:06,400
Although neither sun nor moon are on my side,

22
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:06,400
Taiyou mo tsuki mo nanmo kanzen ni kocchi muiteinaiga

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,820
Yarushikanainda

24
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,820
"I've no choice but to try,"

25
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,490
Those were the words I muttered to myself.

26
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,490
Iikikaseruyouni sotto tsubuyaita

27
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,080
The odds aren't on my side, but running way'd be gutless.

28
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,080
Joukyou wa waruiga tada nigedasunja konjou nainaa

29
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,080
Even if I can't see the future, I'll just have to win it over with courage.

30
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,080
Tenbou wa naiga dokyou de kuria suru shika naiya

31
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,580
Need to keep distance from the target as I hold myself back.

32
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,580
Shoudou wa osaetamama taagetto to no kankaku sagure

33
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,880
All that's needed for victory is pride to win.

34
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,880
Hitsuyou na mon wa katsu puraido

35
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,970
Will we celebrate with the wine of victory

36
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,970
Ajiwau nowa shouri no bishu ka

37
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,970
Or'll we end up kissing their feet in defeat?

38
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,970
Soretomo haiboku no kujuu ka

39
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:37,720
There are two outcomes to everything.

40
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:37,720
Sou subete wa futatsu ni hitotsu

41
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,440
I want to control destiny.

42
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,440
Ayatsuritai unmei no ito

43
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:46,770
I need to seize the golden opportunity with my hands.

44
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:46,770
Zekkou no goorudentaimu kono te de tsukame

45
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,860
I'll finish it up with my best poker face,

46
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,860
Konshin no pookaafeisu kimete shikakeruyo

47
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,820
And drag them into a world of illusions.

48
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,820
Iryuujon no sekai e hikizurikonde

49
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,160
I'll find my way out of this endless pressure game,

50
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,160
Saigennai puresshaageemu sururito nukete

51
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,170
And leap over the borderline of honor.

52
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,170
Eikou no boodaarain tobikoeru tameni

53
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,880
How many? What'll I need to sacrifice to make it happen?

54
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,880
Haumenii? Dorekurai no daishou ga iru?

55
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,140
What is the one thing I don't want to let go?

56
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,140
Tebanashitakunai mon wa dore?

57
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,380
A man thought to be Scar was sighted on a mountain trail near the area.

58
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,300
We should start here.

59
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,630
An abandoned mine?

60
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,050
That's right.

61
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:30,590
This town, Baschool, is now a ghost town.

62
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,140
It would make a great hideout.

63
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,930
How troublesome.

64
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,140
So we're going to split up.

65
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,770
If a party spots him, report back immediately.

66
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,820
Roger!

67
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,740
We'll accompany the Elric Brothers.

68
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,030
Yeah, yeah.

69
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,700
I wonder if they're coming to keep an eye on us.

70
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,950
Most likely.

71
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,310
Conflict at Baschool

72
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,960
Now...

73
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,210
How should we get rid of these two...

74
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,840
Hey! I just saw a shadow!

75
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,590
What?!

76
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,010
Over here!

77
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,180
Hey! Hang on!

78
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:18,770
Hey! Wait!

79
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:22,770
They disappeared!

80
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,900
Where did they go?!

81
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,070
Did they go into that room?!

82
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,650
Damn them, running around!

83
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:36,080
We were able to get rid of them, but...

84
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,080
...this place...

85
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,080
...is a bit...

86
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:45,000
...too big, don't you think?!

87
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,970
Where are Scar and that little girl?

88
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,930
If they don't randomly show up,
it'll be impossible for us to find them...

89
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,470
Sir Alphonse!

90
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,810
Sir Alphonse!!!

91
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:00,480
Hey!

92
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,560
No way...

93
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,400
Sir Alphonse!

94
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,860
She really showed up...

95
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,780
What are you doing here?!

96
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,900
May!

97
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,950
Great! I found you!

98
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,740
Don't tell me... you came here looking for me?

99
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,370
Yeah! I wanted to see you!

100
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,580
Sir Al...

101
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,300
I wanted to see you and learn more about Eastern Alchemy...

102
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,720
Oh my gosh! Am I dreaming? Sir Al came looking for me?

103
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,010
Huh?

104
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,720
Hey, brat!

105
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,140
I've been dying to see you!

106
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,810
I'm not letting you get away this time!

107
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,810
Hurry up and teach us Eastern Alchemy!

108
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,980
You brothers are feuding for my hand!

109
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,320
But you're not my type, Edward!

110
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,820
Don't play dumb with me!

111
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,530
Hey, Al...

112
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,530
Oh, sorry about that.

113
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,410
Ow...

114
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,370
I hit my head.

115
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,750
Who is that woman, Sir Alphonse?!

116
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,370
How horrible... You have me, and yet...

117
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,420
No! She's just an old friend of mine!

118
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:13,050
Wait... Why am I talking like a two-timer?

119
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,680
May, please don't run off by yourself-

120
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,430
The Elric Brothers?!

121
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,720
Who are you?

122
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,230
It's me, Marcoh.

123
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,020
Dr. Marcoh?!

124
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,270
What happened to your face?

125
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,900
What are you doing here?

126
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,490
The Elric Brothers!

127
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,700
Who the heck are you?

128
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,700
Don't you dare say you forgot!

129
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,490
I'm Yoki, the great coal-mine owner of Youswell!

130
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,660
Guess I forgot.

131
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,620
Actually, I don't even think I know you.

132
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,500
How awful! After all those things you did to me...

133
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,460
1914

134
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,840
Youswell

135
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,630
Youswell, a mining town.

136
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:01,970
I, Yoki, was a soldier and manager of the town.

137
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:07,480
The people of the town lived happily due to my efforts.

138
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,190
Hurry up and pay

139
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,690
your taxes!

140
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,820
We can't because you keep cutting our salaries!

141
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:28,420
And that's where the uttermost villain,
Edward Elric, a State Alchemist, showed up!

142
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,590
Silver pocketwatch!?

143
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,090
State Alchemist!!

144
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,720
Gold!!

145
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,970
I want to buy the rights to the coal mine with this

146
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,480
But it was a trap!

147
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,610
What is this about, Mr. Alchemist?!

148
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,620
All the gold I received from you turned into rocks!

149
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,460
They were working together!

150
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,930
And I, who had the mine stolen from me...

151
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,300
...suffered at the hands of the people who forgot what they owed me...

152
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,640
...and was given a bad name by the military.

153
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,520
I started many businesses in order to return to popularity...

154
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,070
...but it all ended in failure...

155
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,610
My investments...

156
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,740
...also ended in failure...

157
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,290
And my last resort...

158
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:55,750
...was to ask a millionaire for a goodwill loan...

159
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,410
If only...

160
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,960
If only it hadn't been for those Elric Brothers...

161
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,170
And that was when I swore...

162
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:43,090
Swore to take revenge against those two who brought me down like this.

163
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:48,310
An act of revenge far worse than death!

164
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:54,390
I won't lose to a thief like you!

165
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,480
No... I'm not really a thief...

166
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,440
I'm telling you, there's nothing between us!

167
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,860
Who cares! I need to ask you about Eastern Alchemy!

168
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,570
Hey! How about you two listen to me?!

169
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,990
Yeah, whatever. It must have been hard, old man.

170
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,280
I totally understand how you feel.

171
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,410
Quit pretending like you were listening!

172
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,000
You can't find Miss Winry?

173
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,920
Seriously... what were you all doing?

174
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,210
We're terribly sorry...

175
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,460
I'll go look for her.

176
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,510
Two men from Charlie squad come with me.

177
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,340
Yes, sir!

178
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,550
Major Miles.

179
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,510
I know. Scar, right?

180
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,720
I'll contact you if I find him.

181
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,490
This place is no good either, huh?

182
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,490
There's barely anything here.

183
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,120
You're Scar, right?

184
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,460
Sir Kimblee would like to see you.

185
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,670
Come with us.

186
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,210
I'm surprised you were able to find me.

187
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:06,300
But do you really think the two of you can take me?

188
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,300
Probably not, if we were ordinary humans.

189
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,360
If  we were ordinary humans, that is!

190
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,240
Chimeras, huh...

191
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,660
Interesting!

192
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,420
I've learned a lot since then.

193
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,170
First, the method to create a philosopher's stone.

194
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:54,100
Second, the history of this country. And that there's something odd about the alchemy this country uses.

195
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,770
That's why we came after this girl, seeking a possibility in Eastern Alchemy from Xing.

196
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,690
Nothing less to be expected from you.

197
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,990
The thing is, someone realized it far before you did.

198
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,450
These are the research documents he left us.

199
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:16,200
We think these documents may hold a clue to solving the mystery.

200
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,580
So if we could decipher it...

201
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,710
Yes, possibly...

202
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,960
But to do that, we need Scar's help.

203
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,170
Why him?!

204
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,180
What was that sound?

205
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,720
That's where Scar went!

206
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,180
Could it be the army?!

207
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,520
You four hide here.

208
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,360
We'll go see what's going on.

209
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,570
Scar is...

210
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,830
He's fat, but that doesn't slow him down at all!

211
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,010
I heard you're powerless unless you can actually touch us.

212
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,720
So we're going to be attacking from a distance.

213
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:33,200
And we're also aware that you attempt to destroy the ground when things get bad for you.

214
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,660
We'll beat you to a pulp and hand you over to Sir Kimblee!

215
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,460
Talk about good timing.

216
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,960
The Elric Brothers?

217
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,500
This voice...

218
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,420
Brother, they're Kimblee's men from Central.

219
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,590
What?

220
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,260
I get it...

221
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,350
You don't need to do anything besides watch.

222
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,640
We're going to capture Scar-

223
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,060
A monster!!!

224
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,650
W-What was that for?! We're on your sid-

225
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:10,150
I don't recall having any monsters on our side!

226
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,230
How frightening!

227
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:14,150
They're going to pretend they're on our side, then eat us!

228
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:18,200
The fat one back there has a really big mouth! He'll eat me whole!

229
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,160
You brat! Stay put!

230
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,880
Is he faster than Scar?!

231
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,800
Brother?

232
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,050
What's so funny?!

233
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,770
So light!

234
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,780
It feels like my limbs are made of feathers!

235
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,690
Northern automails are fabulous!

236
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,570
Don't get too cocky now...

237
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,370
Huh? I guess my punches lost some force, too.

238
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,500
My spit won't come off that easily!

239
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,870
This is slob?! That's just gross!

240
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,420
In that case...

241
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:17,130
If I decompose it, it's pretty much water!

242
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,430
Th-That's cold!!

243
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,680
Take this!

244
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,770
What the heck was that for, Brother?!

245
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,390
O-O-Ow! Stop moving!

246
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,690
You're going to tear my skin off!

247
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:33,360
How did you like my "Touching Cold Metal With Wet Hands and Getting Stuck Together" attack?

248
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:37,490
Quit getting in our way, Fullmetal Alchemist!

249
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,410
Aren't you on our  side?!

250
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:43,030
Shut up, pig! I don't know anyone who looks like you!

251
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:45,160
Besides, anyone can tell you're a bad guy!

252
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,790
If you still insist that you're on our side, prove it!

253
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,920
Fine! I'll transform back, just watch!

254
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,760
I've been waiting for this!

255
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,130
Zampano!

256
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,970
How foolish of you to sheath
your sword in front of your enemy.

257
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,770
Dammit! Get off me!

258
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,730
Okay, I'm going to need you to take a little nap.

259
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,360
He's in fighting shape, now...

260
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,650
Hurry up and get caught already.

261
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,450
Face trial, Scar!

262
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,330
I'll destroy whoever gets in my way.

263
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,210
He's coming head-on, without thinking?

264
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,640
Your steel arm is mine!

265
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,480
Sorry. It's not made out of steel anymore!

266
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,730
Stay still!

267
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,990
Stop it!

268
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,550
Idiot! Why did you come?!

269
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,090
Stay back.

270
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,220
Major Miles.

271
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,810
Wh-What's up with these two?

272
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,480
The people at Central seem to be conducting awful experiments.

273
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,860
Tie them to that pillar over there.

274
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,990
Aye, sir!

275
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,240
Now, Scar...

276
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:50,660
It doesn't please me to pass judgment on a fellow countryman, but I can't let someone like you run free.

277
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,410
Fellow countryman?

278
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,630
Elric Brothers, we'll take care of the rest...

279
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,090
Winry!

280
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,670
Idiot! Stay away from him!

281
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:04,300
Let me go... I'll be fine.

282
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,390
How will you be fine?!

283
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,300
Stay away from him, Miss.

284
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,810
Please let me talk to him.

285
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:15,270
I want to talk to him face to face.

286
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:31,540
Why did you kill my parents?

287
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,290
No matter what I say, it'll be only be an excuse.

288
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:42,300
The fact is I killed the Rockbells.

289
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,020
What was that?!

290
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,900
It's in the location of the building we received a report from!

291
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,410
This isn't good. We've been down here for more than twenty-four hours, which is what we promised.

292
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,420
It's the Ice Queen we're talking about.

293
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,460
I'm sure she really sealed the exit.

294
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,250
It's only natural we took so long.

295
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,170
We groped our way here with the lanterns out, after all.

296
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:29,760
Since they insisted a monster would come if we kept the lights on.

297
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,900
Welcome back.

298
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,740
Thank goodness!

299
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,740
Take these two to the infirmary. Quickly!

300
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,200
Sorry for the trouble...

301
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,540
You have nothing to apologize for.

302
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,790
I thought I told you to seal the exit after twenty-four hours?

303
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,340
Ah. But, look.

304
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,130
It hasn't been twenty-four hours yet.

305
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:13,550
By the way, Major General Armstrong told me to go by this watch.

306
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,360
General!

307
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,860
Was the advance unit safe?

308
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,320
Just two of them.

309
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,330
I see.

310
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,660
What are you doing here, if I may ask?

311
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,830
I was looking at the mountains.

312
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,840
Winter is nice here, isn't it?

313
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,760
I only see black and white.

314
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,300
It's very plain, and I like it.

315
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,260
Do you think so?

316
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:58,270
If you look up, there's also the color blue.

317
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,600
It's just like a person's heart, isn't it?

318
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:08,860
I greatly appreciate you giving us leeway this time, ma'am.

319
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:13,610
Huh? I have no idea what you're talking about.

320
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,170
Looks like we've got some guests.

321
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,720
It's been a while.

322
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:44,350
Sorry for asking this the moment of my arrival,
but is there something you owe us an explanation for?

323
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,570
Don't get too close!

324
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:57,450
All men, stay back!

325
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,540
Dammit!

326
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,340
Fullmetal Alchemist?

327
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,170
Kimblee!

328
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:14,180
Why the hell didn't you keep an eye on Winry?!

329
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,890
Mr. Kimblee, the roof!

330
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:37,750
Even if we part and meet again, I want to meet at this place.

331
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:37,750
Megurimeguttemo mata koko de aitai

332
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:44,680
Then we'll hold hands to ensure we'll never be separated again.

333
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:44,680
Hagurenaiyouni kono te wo tsunagunda

334
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,310
We used to talk all night until the sun rose,

335
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,310
Asahi ga noboru made katariattane

336
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:50,140
And held hands till the sun went under the horizon.

337
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:50,140
Yuuhi ga shizumu made tsunaida te

338
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:55,390
Kouyatte asu mo asatte mo tomo ni ayumou hikari to kage

339
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:55,390
Let's walk together like this forever, like light and shadow.

340
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,940
I stand in the city, staring off into space with lonely eyes.

341
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,940
Samishige ni mitsumeru machi no naka de

342
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:05,280
I can't find warmth on my own.

343
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:05,280
Nukumori wa hitori ja mitsukaranakute

344
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,790
By meeting you, I realized

345
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,790
Ai ga konnani tsuyosa ni narukoto

346
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:16,620
How much strength love could give me.

347
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:16,620
Shittanda kimi ni deaete hajimete

348
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,880
Even if we part and meet again, I want to meet at this place.

349
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,880
Megurimeguttemo mata koko de aitai

350
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:27,180
Then we'll hold hands to ensure we'll never be separated again.

351
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:27,180
Hagurenaiyouni kono te wo tsunagunda

352
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:32,390
I can't sleep by myself, 'cause I can't dream without you.

353
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:32,390
Hitori ja nemurenai yume wa mirenaikara

354
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:38,150
So take me to a place where uncertainty can't reach us

355
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:38,150
Donna fuan mo todokanai tokoro e

356
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:43,400
And let us bring light to the night sky with no stars.

357
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:43,400
Hoshi no yoru mo terashitsuzukeyou

358
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,900
So long as you're with me, I can go to world's end.

359
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,900
Doko made mo yukeru kimi to nara

360
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,910
Even if it's a path I can't walk on my own,

361
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,910
Hitori ja arukenai michi mo futari nara

362
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,950
If you're by my side, I can walk it while humming a tune.

363
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,950
Hanauta utainagara arukerunda

364
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:55,370
If we're together, the world is mine.

365
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:55,370
Kimi ga ireba shiawase

366
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,300
Even if an encounter is accompanied by grief,

367
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,890
there is still meaning in it.

368
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:10,060
The path to take is inscribed in feelings that come and go.

369
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:15,780
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

370
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,780
Daydream

371
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,780
Episode 39, Daydream.

372
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:25,450
Is everything part of a plan devised by a superior being?
