1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:06,140
Alchemy is a science where one understands the structure of matter, breaks it down, then rebuilds it.

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:11,770
However, it is not an all-powerful technique,
as one cannot create something out of nothing.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,570
If one wishes to gain something,
one must present something of equal value.

4
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:22,280
This is the concept of equivalent exchange, the fundamental basis of alchemy.

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,910
However, there is a taboo in alchemy. Human transmutation.

6
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,250
One must not commit this act.

7
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,930
I've still got a lot of years ahead of me

8
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,930
Kono omoi wo keshiteshimau niwa

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,840
To just erase these feelings?

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,930
Mada jinsei nagai desho?

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:35,890
To just erase these feelings?

12
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:35,930
To just erase these feelings?

13
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,930
Yarinokoshiteru koto

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,930
I want to go back and finish

15
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,560
The things that I've yet to finish.

16
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,560
Yarinaoshite mitai kara

17
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:58,830
I was supposed to be chasing after my ongoing dream,

18
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:58,830
Yume no tsuzuki oikaketeita hazu nanoni

19
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:05,170
Yet I faltered over others while walking this thin, winding path.

20
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:05,170
Magarikunetta hosoi michi hito ni tsumazuku

21
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,340
It's not that I want to return to those days.

22
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,340
Ano koro mitainitte modoritai wake ja nai no

23
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,840
I'm searching for the sky I lost.

24
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,840
Nakushitekita sora wo sagashiteru

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,510
Don't make that sad face, as if you've fallen victim.

26
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,510
Wakatte kuremasu youni

27
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:18,720
As if you want people to pity you.

28
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:18,720
Gisei ni natta youna kanashii kao wa yameteyo

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,430
Tears aren't the end of your sins.

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,430
Tsumi no saigo wa namida ja nai yo

31
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,100
You have to bear them painfully, forever.

32
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,100
Zutto kurushiku seottekunda

33
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,770
Who are you waiting for in the maze of emotions,

34
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,770
Deguchi mienai kanjoumeiro ni

35
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,440
Where you can't even see the exit?

36
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,440
Dare wo matteruno?

37
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,230
I want to blurt it out more justly,

38
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,230
Shiroi nooto ni tsuzutta youni

39
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,980
Motto sunao ni hakidashitai yo

40
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,980
Just like how I wrote it in my white notebook.

41
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,650
What do you want to run from?

42
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,650
Nani kara nogaretainda

43
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,280
That thing called "reality"?

44
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,280
Genjitsu tte yatsu?

45
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,610
I just want to scream out,

46
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,610
Kanaeru tame ni ikiterundatte

47
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,030
"I'm only living to fulfill my wish." Can you hear me?

48
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,030
Sakebitaku naru yo kikoeteimasuka?

49
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,160
I can't take the safe way out of everything.

50
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,160
Bunan ni nante yatterarenaikara

51
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,960
I don't even have a place to return to.

52
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,960
Kaeru basho mo nai no

53
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,250
Yasashisa ni wa itsumo kansha shiteru

54
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,250
I'm always thankful for everyone's kindness,

55
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,630
That's why I want to become stronger. (I'm on the way)

56
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,630
Dakara tsuyoku naritai (I'm on the way)

57
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,590
This is reminding me of the old days.

58
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,590
Natsukashiku naru

59
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,840
This pain is all right with me.

60
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,840
Konna itami mo kangei jan

61
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,220
To you, children of God, who live on this earth,

62
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,890
pray and believe, and you shall be saved.

63
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:11,890
The Sun God Leto shines light upon you to show you the way.

64
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,890
Are you guys street performers or something?

65
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,480
Where in the world did you get that idea?

66
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,770
Am I wrong?

67
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,110
Thanks for the meal.

68
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,030
Hey now, sir!

69
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,280
Sorry about that, we'll fix it.

70
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,870
"Fix", you say?

71
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,370
Well, just watch.

72
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,700
Well then, here I go!

73
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,670
How's that?

74
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,590
Now that's quite a surprise.

75
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,090
You're able to perform miracles, as well?

76
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,470
What the heck are you talking about?

77
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,510
We're alchemists.

78
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,220
That's the first time I've seen anything like that.

79
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,560
You've never heard of us, the Elric Brothers, before?

80
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,270
"Elric"?

81
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,020
Actually, I have.

82
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,810
The Fullmetal Alchemist, Edward Elric!

83
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,480
Oh, so you're that rumored genius alchemist.

84
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,320
Ah, I get it! Your other name is "Fullmetal" because of this suit!

85
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,360
No... You have the wrong person...

86
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,950
Huh? That little guy over there?

87
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,710
Who are you calling a pea-sized runt?!

88
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,740
City of Heresy

89
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,790
Pray and believe...

90
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,710
So, what the heck is this broadcast?

91
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,630
I-It's the High Priest Cornello...

92
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:31,550
He came here a few years ago and preached to us about the path of God.

93
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,810
"God will grant eternity to the living and resurrection to the dead."

94
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,140
And proof of it all are the miracles that he produces.

95
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,980
"Resurrection to the dead", eh?

96
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,900
Sounds fishy to me.

97
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,960
That's what they were talking about, huh?

98
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,250
What do you think?

99
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,750
It's pretty obvious from that transmutation response that it's alchemy.

100
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,630
But he's totally ignoring the concept of equivalent exchange.

101
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:11,260
It's a rule that you can only produce something from matter of equal value.

102
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,800
He changed a flower to a mineral, too.

103
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,010
Brother, could it be...

104
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,020
Yeah. It could be...

105
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,310
Bingo.

106
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,950
God... please listen to my wish...

107
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,660
Please bring back-

108
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,040
Ah, so this is Mr. Leto.

109
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,210
Are you interested in the religion of Leto?

110
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,210
Nah. Unfortunately, I'm an atheist.

111
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,960
That's not good.

112
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,760
Believing and honoring God,
and living in gratitude and hope...

113
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,090
How glorious.

114
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,180
If you believe...

115
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,020
I'm sure you'll grow taller!

116
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,390
What did you say?!

117
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,690
She didn't mean it in a bad way!

118
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,020
"Resurrection to the dead"...

119
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,780
Do you seriously believe something like that?

120
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,400
Yes.

121
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,950
Water, 35L.

122
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,530
Carbon, 20kg.

123
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,040
Ammonia, 4L.

124
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,950
Lime, 1.5kg.

125
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,620
Phosphorus, 800g.

126
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,330
Salt, 250g.

127
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,630
Niter, 100g.

128
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,380
And others.

129
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,460
...What?

130
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,550
Those are the ingredients that make up an average adult human body.

131
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:40,220
We know this from our advances in science, but there
haven't been any reports of successful human transmutations.

132
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,600
You really think that praying would solve something that even science couldn't solve?

133
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,980
"Pray and believe, and your wishes shall be."

134
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,110
And by the way,

135
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:55,740
you can buy these basic ingredients at the market with a kid's pocket money.

136
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,660
Humans are made pretty cheaply, aren't they?

137
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:03,460
People are not things. Those words are blasphemy to our creator.

138
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,870
You'll suffer divine punishment for that.

139
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,130
Alchemists are scientists, after all.

140
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,800
We don't believe in creators or the existence of a God.

141
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,760
Looking for the solution to the creation principle of this world and pursuing the truth.

142
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:25,270
It's pretty ironic we're the closest things to God
in a sense, even though we have no need for him.

143
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,480
Are you saying you're on the same level as God?

144
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,020
How arrogant!

145
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,030
Arrogant, huh?

146
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,860
I remember this from a mythical tale.

147
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:42,040
"The hero who gets too close to the sun shall have
his wax wings plucked and be dropped to the earth."

148
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,620
Brother.

149
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:51,550
Lady, will Mr. Leto save a scientist like me?
Even though I was thinking something like that?

150
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:56,050
Of course. He will accept reformers at any time.

151
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,550
High Priest, there are people who wish to have a meeting with you.

152
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,060
Two of them. A child and a man in a suit of armor.

153
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,560
They call themselves the "Elric Brothers".

154
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,230
I'm busy. Dismiss them.

155
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,400
Actually, wait... Did you say... the Elric Brothers?

156
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,230
Yes, that's what they said...

157
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:19,280
This is going to be trouble.
It's the Fullmetal Alchemist, Edward Elric.

158
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,070
The... man in the armor?!

159
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,830
Yeah, probably.

160
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,790
What is a State Alchemist doing here?

161
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,330
Could it be that our plan has been...

162
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,340
Those dogs of the military must have a good sense of smell.

163
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,880
This way, please.

164
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,680
The High Priest is a very busy man, and he usually cannot find time for such matters, but...

165
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,340
You folks are lucky.

166
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,520
Sorry for the trouble. I'll try to make it quick.

167
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,060
Yeah, let's get this over with as quickly as possible.

168
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,610
Priest, what are you doing?!

169
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:59,150
Rose, these people are heathens who are trying to ensnare the High Priest. They are evil.

170
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,200
No, that's...

171
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,830
So... let's get this over with quick!

172
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,340
Strike!

173
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,710
So noisy!

174
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,430
Welcome to the holy order, Fullmetal Alchemist.

175
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:23,930
Sir Cornello!

176
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,060
Looks like some of us were rather hasty.

177
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,980
I apologize for their rudeness.

178
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,600
It really doesn't feel like an apology when you're looking down at us from a high place like that.

179
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,610
Are you here for our dogma?

180
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:40,570
I have a lot of things I want to learn from you... say,
a method for tricking your followers with petty alchemy.

181
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,490
I have no idea what you're talking about.

182
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,080
I can't have you putting my miracles and alchemy on the same level.

183
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,580
How's this? Can this be achieved through alchemy?

184
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,500
That's precisely what I'm concerned about.

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,840
For some strange reason, you can perform
transmutations while clearly ignoring the rules.

186
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,340
Which is why it isn't alchemy-

187
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,800
So I was thinking...

188
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:12,520
If you had the legendary amplifier that allows alchemists to perform the impossible, it would be possible in your case.

189
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,350
What?

190
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:18,530
Yep. Frankly, the Philosopher's Stone. Isn't that what your ring is made of?

191
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,030
That was a long search.

192
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,360
This is just an ordinary ring.

193
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,700
God has allowed me to perform miracles.

194
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,830
Still gonna play dumb?

195
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:33,460
Guess I'll have to get my hands on you and ask your body for the truth.

196
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,380
You seem to be an incorrigible heathen.

197
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:37,960
Rose.

198
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,460
Y-Yes?

199
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,470
Pick up that pistol.

200
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,720
Yes, sir...

201
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:50,220
Now shoot the Fullmetal Alchemist.

202
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,100
I... can't do that...

203
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,900
My words are God's words.

204
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,150
This is God's will.

205
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,110
Rose, shoot him.

206
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,870
What's wrong?

207
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,620
Who was the one...

208
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,710
...who rescued you from your despair
after you lost your love in an accident last year?

209
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,960
It was you, Sir Cornello...

210
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,670
That's right. It was I who rescued you.

211
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,720
And what did I promise you?

212
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,220
That you'd revive him!

213
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:31,260
Umm... I'm not the one you're supposed to be aiming at...

214
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,020
I'm the Fullmetal Alchemist, got it?!

215
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,150
Wait, you're the one?!

216
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,280
Sorry... I have to.

217
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,030
He's a swindler.

218
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,860
No, he isn't!

219
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,410
He's going to revive him with his miracles!

220
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,910
Then shoot me.

221
00:10:59,330 --> 00:10:59,960
Al!

222
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,510
Good work. God is rejoicing.

223
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,970
Now, shoot the other.

224
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,970
Man, you make your followers do terrible things.

225
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:13,890
What?!

226
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,390
What's going on?!

227
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,480
As you can see...

228
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,900
...this is how it is.

229
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,940
An empty suit of armor!

230
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,320
This, itself, is evidence of their evil!

231
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,740
They must be eliminated!

232
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,170
Is this your first time seeing a chimera?

233
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,840
So you made something like this with your Philosopher's Stone, too, eh?

234
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,970
I should probably arm myself...

235
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,640
Without a transmutation circle?!

236
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,400
I guess your title of "State Alchemist" has to come with something!

237
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,110
But...

238
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:10,280
How do you like those claws that cut through iron?!

239
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,280
Just kidding.

240
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,750
Unfortunately, my leg is a bit special.

241
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,250
Bite him to death!

242
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,010
What's wrong, stupid cat?

243
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,840
Get a good taste of it!

244
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,890
That arm...

245
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,890
...and a brother without his body...

246
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,640
Ah, I see now.

247
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:44,480
Fullmetal Alchemist... you...

248
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,980
You've done it, haven't you?!

249
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,530
Get down here, third-rate!

250
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,990
I'll show you the difference in our skill!

251
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,500
Get down here, third-rate!

252
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,830
I'll show you the difference in our skill!

253
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:07,840
Rose, these guys have committed the greatest taboo alchemists can commit.

254
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,670
Human transmutation.

255
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:13,970
They tried to revive the dead.

256
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:21,520
"The hero who gets too close to the sun shall have
his wax wings plucked and be dropped to the earth."

257
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,520
No way...

258
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:28,150
This is the body of a sinner who encroached upon God's territory.

259
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,530
Rose, are you really prepared to be like this?

260
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,910
Edward Elric.

261
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:39,040
And you call yourself a State Alchemist? You make me laugh.

262
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,540
Shut the hell up!

263
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,290
You can't do anything without
the Philosopher's Stone, third-rate!

264
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:47,540
High Priest, please give us the stone before you get hurt.

265
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:52,090
How ridiculous! Fools who stepped into God's territory!

266
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:56,300
I'll send you to his side, once and for all!

267
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,650
Nah, God seems to hate me,
so he'll probably send me back even if I went.

268
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,400
Al!

269
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,500
What are you doing?! After them!

270
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,750
They are heathens who bring evil to the order! Catch them!

271
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,300
Stop right there!

272
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,050
What do you think you can do unarmed, kid?

273
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,930
Just give up before you get hurt.

274
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,980
Don't let your guard down just because he's a kid!

275
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,650
Out of the way!

276
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,650
Get it now, Rose?

277
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,070
Cornello shot at us, even though you were with us.

278
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,080
But that's because you two...

279
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,580
Is that story true?

280
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,840
We just wanted to see Mom's smiling face again.

281
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,220
But the transmutation failed.

282
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:19,260
It didn't even look human.

283
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,470
We learned our mistake the hard way.

284
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,190
People cannot be revived... even our mom.

285
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,810
That's not true... because...

286
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,530
The fundamental basis of alchemy is the concept of equivalent exchange.

287
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,570
The price we paid for the human transmutation was huge.

288
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,700
Brother lost his left leg, and I lost my body.

289
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,790
Can you see it?

290
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,960
Brother drew it with his blood.

291
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:53,210
It must have been painful for him,
after having his left leg taken away.

292
00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:01,300
But Brother affixed my soul to this suit and gave up his right arm as compensation.

293
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,890
I want to fix my brother's body.

294
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,730
Brother wants to get my body back, too.

295
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,690
But we may die trying.

296
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,740
That's the path we've chosen.

297
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,620
But, Sir Cornello could...

298
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:23,910
Rose...

299
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,870
Even if you two can't, he could...

300
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,920
He could do it! He will!

301
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,960
You brat! You'd better be prepared!

302
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,840
Old man, let's have a heart-to-heart talk.

303
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,550
I just want to know the secret behind that stone.

304
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,140
Or should I call for the army to mobilize?

305
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,970
To inspect the stone, that is.

306
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,730
Fine.

307
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,650
What do you plan to do with the Philosopher's Stone?

308
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,820
You don't need that pitiful order if you have the stone, do you?

309
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:05,200
The order will produce followers that will joyfully give up their lives for me!

310
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,290
They would be an undefeatable army that does not fear even death.

311
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,700
Just watch.

312
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:14,710
I'm going to be stripping this country away in a few years.

313
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,920
By using the Philosopher's Stone and my stupid followers!

314
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,510
I guess I could share some of the leftovers with you.

315
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,260
What's so funny?!

316
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,890
This is why I called you third-rate.

317
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,230
Y...

318
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,480
You didn't...

319
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,240
There are no such things as miracles.

320
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,820
They were all thanks to the power of the Philosopher's Stone.

321
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,660
Y-You...

322
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,240
When did you flip on that switch?!

323
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,240
When?!

324
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,250
From the very beginning.

325
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,250
It's all been leaked, now.

326
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,250
What have you done?!

327
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,460
You brat!!!

328
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,840
Too slow!

329
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,510
Told ya. We're on totally different levels.

330
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,470
I'm invincible!

331
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,520
R-Rebound!

332
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,190
I'm not giving up yet!

333
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:25,700
I'm... I'm...

334
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:29,370
God's hand!!!

335
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:54,680
My words are God's words. This fist is God's fist!

336
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,690
"God's fist", you say?!

337
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,480
If you like it so much, I'll let you have a taste of it!

338
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,130
Shut up!

339
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,090
Now give me the Philosopher's Stone!

340
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,800
It... broke? What does this mean?

341
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:36,350
How could the Philosopher's Stone break? It's supposed to be a perfect substance!

342
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,480
I... I don't know!

343
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,060
I didn't hear about this!

344
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,310
P-P-P-Please don't hurt me!

345
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,520
Please! I was wrong!

346
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,190
So it was a fake?

347
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:48,070
I can't do anything without the stone! Please, have mercy!!!

348
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:52,410
I finally thought we'd be able to get our bodies back, and it's...

349
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,830
...fake...

350
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,710
U-Umm, what about me?

351
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,380
Go wherever you want!!!

352
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,710
Yes, sir!

353
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,050
What about the Philosopher's Stone?

354
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,470
It was a fake.

355
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:10,890
I see...

356
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:16,100
And I thought we'd finally be able to get your body back...

357
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,730
Give me the Philosopher's Stone!

358
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,650
Rose...

359
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:25,020
Didn't I just say that it was a fake?

360
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,980
And in any case, it broke on its own.

361
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,820
That's a lie!

362
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,450
You're planning to keep it for yourselves, aren't you!

363
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,990
To fix your bodies... right?!

364
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,910
And you want to meet your mother again, too...

365
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,080
Shut up!

366
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,870
The dead cannot be revived...

367
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,170
Never...

368
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,170
Never.

369
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,920
But he said that he'd be able to bring him back...

370
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,430
He said that if I prayed, it would come true.

371
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,720
That a miracle would occur...

372
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:59,560
What am I supposed to cling to from now on?!

373
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,520
Tell me!

374
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,310
Hey...

375
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,940
Decide that for yourself.

376
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,200
Get up and take a step. Walk forward.

377
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,330
You've got two fine legs on you.

378
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,540
You don't need to cling to anything.

379
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,800
What's going on?!

380
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,670
Let us see the High Priest!

381
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,590
Were you guys tricking us?!

382
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,050
Open this door!!!

383
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,180
My plans... ruined by a brat like that...

384
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,730
Seriously. What a mess.

385
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,810
All you had to do was to wreak a bit of havoc.

386
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,230
You...

387
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,610
Hey, Lust?

388
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,740
Can I eat this guy?

389
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,820
No, Gluttony.

390
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,240
If you eat something like that, you'll get a stomachache.

391
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,280
How dare... How dare you all make fun of me!

392
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:06,210
You're not needed anymore.

393
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,510
It was just starting to liven up, too.

394
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:16,090
I guess we have to start over.

395
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,600
Father will get mad at us.

396
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:23,140
Now, I wonder what we should do next...

397
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:33,090
Say, the sky we saw that day, the scarlet sky.

398
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:33,090
Ano hi mita sora akaneiro no sora wo

399
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:38,310
Do you remember it from that day?

400
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:38,310
Nee kimi wa oboeteimasuka

401
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:44,230
We made a promise and a vow while the early summer wind circled us.

402
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:44,230
Yakusoku chigiri shoka no kaze ga tsutsumu

403
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,480
And we clung close together.

404
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,480
Futari yorisotta

405
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:57,530
Your forced smile

406
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:57,530
Muri na egao no ura

407
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:02,910
Holds elongated shadows.

408
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:02,910
Nobita kage wo kakumau

409
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:12,170
I pretend not to notice and continue on.

410
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:12,170
Dakara kizukanu furi saisei wo erabu

411
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:21,680
All the while waiting for you to deliver some news at the table.

412
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:21,680
Teeburu no ue no furuenai shirase machitsuzukete

413
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:30,070
Empty nights, mornings that will never arrive,

414
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:30,070
Kuuhaku no yoru mo kuru hazu no nai asa mo

415
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:34,820
I could see them from a mile away.

416
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:34,820
Zenbu wakattetanda

417
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:40,450
Ano hi mita sora akaneiro no sora wo

418
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:40,450
Say, the sky we saw that day, the scarlet sky.

419
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:45,370
I'm sure you'll remember it one day.

420
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:45,370
Nee itsuka omoidasu deshou

421
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:51,210
While holding the promise we couldn't keep,

422
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:51,210
Hatasenakatta yakusoku wo idaite

423
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:55,470
We take our first steps down our own paths.

424
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:55,470
Futari arukidasu

425
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:07,180
Ed and Al visit East City, home of Eastern Headquarters, to report the incident in Lior.

426
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:13,100
And they meet Shou Tucker,
the Sewing-Life Alchemist, and his daughter, Nina.

427
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:18,610
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

428
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,620
An Alchemist's Anguish

429
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:21,610
Episode 4, An Alchemist's Anguish.

430
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:26,660
An encounter. Is that the beginning of suffering?
