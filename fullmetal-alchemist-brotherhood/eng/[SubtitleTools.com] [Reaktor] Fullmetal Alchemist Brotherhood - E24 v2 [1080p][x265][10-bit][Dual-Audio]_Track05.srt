1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:06,190
Drawn by a landscape as white as snow,

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:06,190
Masshiro na keshiki ni ima sasowarete

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,740
I'm headed toward an unseen world.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,740
Boku wa yuku yo mada minu sekai e

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,680
I've been traveling while lost

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,680
Maigo no mama tabi shiteita

7
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,470
Under this gray sky.

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,460
Nezumiiro no sora no shita

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,560
Every day with new maps, stained with my many dreams.

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,560
Higawari no chizu ikutsumo no yume ga nijindeita

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,950
I wonder if someday,

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,950
Itsuka wa sa

13
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,990
Chippoke na boku no kono hohaba demo

14
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,990
Even with these tiny steps of mine,

15
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:43,070
I'll be able to travel beyond those clouds.

16
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:43,070
Ano kumo no mukou made yukeru kana

17
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,700
I put on a bold front.

18
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,700
Tsuyogatte

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,250
End up hurting myself.

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,250
Kizutsuita

21
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,330
I feel empty inside.

22
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,330
Kokoro sukashita youni

23
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,870
It's started to rain,

24
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,870
Furidashita

25
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,040
And the raindrops

26
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,040
Amatsubu tachi ga

27
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,260
Began to repeat their scattered reflections.

28
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,260
Ranhansha kurikaesu

29
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,130
These straight rays of light

30
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,130
Massugu na hikari ga

31
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,850
Start to cross one another.

32
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,850
Kousa shite

33
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,430
And without telling anyone where they're headed,

34
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,430
Yakusaki mo tsugenumama

35
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,720
Across the endless distances,

36
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,720
Doko made mo

37
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,310
They pass through all matter.

38
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,310
Tsukinukeru

39
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:14,140
Awai zanzou ryoume ni yakitsukete

40
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:14,140
I burn these faint afterimages onto my eyes.

41
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,060
Under this sky,

42
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,060
Kono sora no shita

43
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,890
Wherever I am,

44
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,890
Donna toko ni itemo

45
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,190
I should be able to reach

46
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,190
Todoku hazu nanda

47
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:27,000
The unseen world.

48
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:27,000
Mada minu sekai e

49
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,480
Geez, you still haven't had a bite?

50
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,310
You're an important human sacrifice candidate.

51
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,450
We need you to stay healthy.

52
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,910
Are you listening, Doctor Marcoh?

53
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,460
I've been thinking for some time...

54
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,920
...as to what you mean by "human sacrifice"...

55
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:02,420
...and about what you are trying to make me do...

56
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,560
What you are trying to do right now...

57
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,680
...is to create a giant transmutation circle, using this country and its people.

58
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,230
And the purpose of that...

59
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:18,190
...is to create a philosopher's stone. Am I right?

60
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,690
You're close. On the right track, at least.

61
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,070
On the right track?

62
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,250
So, what are you going to do?

63
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,580
If you're not going to help us out, we'll destroy that village.

64
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,950
I heard from Lust.

65
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:38,960
You'll lend us a hand as long as we promise to leave that village alone, right?

66
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,660
What are you going to do?

67
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,220
Will you help us out and kill everyone in this country?

68
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,470
Or will you refuse and let everyone in that village die?

69
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,980
Such a fool.

70
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,990
By sacrificing something minor,
you'd be able to save something major.

71
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,980
It's a simple concept if you just think about it.

72
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,360
Well, I guess that's what makes you guys human.

73
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,860
Emotion always gets in the way of logic.

74
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,530
It was the same way with that guy I killed.

75
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,500
When I transformed into his wife, he couldn't fight back and lost his chance to get me.

76
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:20,540
It's really helpful to us that you humans are so vulnerable.

77
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,160
Inside the Belly

78
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,310
Seems to me you're really struggling against these humans,

79
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,680
Wrath.

80
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,270
To let Scar get away and even have Gluttony captured is unlike you.

81
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,450
Yes, you're right.

82
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,030
You look happy.

83
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,450
I won't deny that.

84
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,450
I'm having fun.

85
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,460
I've lived for sixty years, and now, I stand at the top of this country.

86
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,850
All according to Father's plan.

87
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:08,890
However...

88
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:17,220
Colonel Mustang, the Elric brothers,
and the ones who come from a foreign land.

89
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:22,480
We, the wise ones, are being thrown into complete disarray.

90
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:30,740
It may just be it's almost time for the young ones to take over the generation, Pride.

91
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,590
Wrath, you've interacted with humans for far too long.

92
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,250
That may be true.

93
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,500
I want you to remember what exactly we are.

94
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:50,130
I won't report to Father that earlier statement, which could be interpreted as treachery.

95
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,260
More importantly, we need to rescue Gluttony.

96
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,570
There's no need to worry about that.

97
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,270
I have a vague idea of their location based on information I received from the military police.

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,210
What is this...

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,650
Colonel! Where are you?!

100
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,400
Stop! Lieutenant!

101
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,540
Colonel!

102
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,010
Lieutenant...

103
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,670
Don't provoke him!

104
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,670
He's only after me!

105
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,010
Mustang!!!

106
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,940
Lan Fan! We're getting out of here!

107
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,850
What... happened?

108
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,850
The monster was keeping another monster inside its belly!

109
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,690
It swallowed everything around him!

110
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,360
So even something like this is created...

111
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,510
...by alchemy...

112
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,240
There's no other choice. I'll have to kill him.

113
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,240
W-Wait, we were finally able to capture a Homunculus!

114
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,500
Staying alive is more important.

115
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,870
Also, he knows our names and our appearances.

116
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,500
There's no reason to let him go alive!

117
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,090
He swallowed...

118
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:24,940
...the fire?

119
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,420
You really are useless, aren't you?!

120
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,410
Then why don't you try to do something about it?!

121
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:35,150
More like, stop following us! He's only after you, Colonel!

122
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,910
Run into the bushes! Spread out!

123
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,840
Dammit... talk about bad timing...

124
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,700
Hurry up, kid!

125
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,310
Hurry! There's no reason to stay here any longer!

126
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,490
But Ed and the others are still...

127
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,530
Not my problem!

128
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,530
I'm just a civilian.

129
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:19,320
Getting dragged into some ridiculous battle like this and dying doesn't sound too great to me!

130
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,080
Dammit!

131
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,080
What's taking them so long?!

132
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,800
Roy Mustang!!!

133
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,390
No!!!

134
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,120
Sounds like he fell for the dummy.

135
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,810
He doesn't seem too happy about it either.

136
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,520
Come on, hurry up and go home,

137
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,120
Mr. Useless.

138
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,630
Lieutenant, you're on this side.

139
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,980
Please take care of Lan Fan.

140
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,530
Are you telling me to shamelessly run away in this situation?!

141
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,530
You'll just get in the way!

142
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,850
Please, just leave!

143
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,460
You're really not helping at all, Colonel.

144
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,210
Seriously, this stupid Colonel...

145
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,150
Just do your own job.

146
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:19,470
The fact that the highest ranked man in this country is a Homunculus isn't exactly a problem you can brush aside.

147
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,230
The highest ranked man...

148
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,680
You don't mean, Führer President Bradley?!

149
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,330
We can talk about this later.

150
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,680
Hop in!

151
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,440
Looks like there aren't any more empty seats.
Just go ahead without us.

152
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,000
You idiot!

153
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,940
There's no way we can just abandon you kids on the battlefield!

154
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:40,320
Your opponent is the upper echelon of the army, right?

155
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,560
We have to beat some information out of that Gluttony guy.

156
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,700
We're going to stay here and fight him.

157
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,210
It doesn't matter that we're kids.

158
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,330
We're the ones who came up with this, anyway.

159
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,340
Thanks for lending us a hand up until now.

160
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,720
Edward.

161
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,270
Take this with you.

162
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,720
You know how to use it, right?

163
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,640
That's something used for killing people.

164
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,890
It's something to protect your lives with.

165
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:21,070
Your hands aren't meant for killing people.

166
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,740
Please don't die.

167
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,950
I'll be borrowing this.

168
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,230
Please, take care of Lan Fan.

169
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:37,920
Young master...

170
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,340
Young master!

171
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,350
Let's go.

172
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,920
Go!

173
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,930
Damn those brats!

174
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,670
Those are the types that end up dying early!

175
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,140
Mustang...

176
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,370
Where is Roy Mustang?!

177
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,570
How dare you kill Lust...

178
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:13,000
I won't forgive you!!!

179
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,880
I said we'd fight him, but he's kind of scary.

180
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,990
He's like a whole new person now...

181
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,420
How are we supposed to capture him?

182
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:23,790
What's wrong?

183
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,130
A dog?

184
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,220
Stop, Gluttony.

185
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,690
I-It talked?!

186
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,900
Hey, it's been a while.

187
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,690
Fullmetal runt.

188
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,210
Who are you calling a flea-sized runt?!

189
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,130
Calm down! I just came to pick up Gluttony!

190
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,510
I have no intentions of fighting mister runt--

191
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,630
Seventh time!

192
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,300
What are you talking about?!

193
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,810
Twice just now, and fives times back at Research Laboratory 5.

194
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,970
All told, you've called me a runt seven times!

195
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,390
Don't tell me you forgot!

196
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:19,560
You've got such a good memory...

197
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,610
Wait!

198
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,730
Giving me so much trouble...

199
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,900
I saw Mustang!

200
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,570
The one who killed Lust!

201
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,570
I'm going to swallow him! Swallow him all up!

202
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,740
You can't do that to the Colonel.

203
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,870
Not to the Elric brothers, either.

204
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,240
No!

205
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,000
I felt it earlier, but...

206
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:40,500
How many people do you have inside of you, Homunculus?!

207
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:46,460
So you're the kid who crossed swords with Wrath.

208
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,380
What do you mean by "kid"?!

209
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,260
I'm the 12th Prince of the Xing Dynasty.

210
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,220
My name is...

211
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:52,930
You can swallow him, though.

212
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,470
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

213
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,230
I see...

214
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:03,150
Looks like you can't do anything to us.

215
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,030
In that case...

216
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,450
Lin, we'll leave him to you!

217
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,450
Fine.

218
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,450
Show it to me, then.

219
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,450
Your skills that were enough to challenge Wrath.

220
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,920
Oh, really now?

221
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,420
He got the highest grade in his class.

222
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,460
On the essay he wrote about you.

223
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,630
Umm... do you mind if I read it here?

224
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,130
Not at the dinner table, dear.

225
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,350
Come on, what's wrong?

226
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,970
Let's hear it.

227
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:36,640
Okay!

228
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,480
My father is the Führer President of Amestris.

229
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:46,150
He works hard every day for this country.

230
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:51,740
He's always thinking about his people.

231
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,700
He's constantly trying to find solutions to problems so that everyone can live in peace.

232
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:04,500
But no matter how busy he is,
he has never forgotten that he has a family.

233
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,880
He loves me and my mother.

234
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:12,680
My father always listens to me.

235
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:16,350
He always respects my wishes.

236
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,930
I love my father and everything about him.

237
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,980
Thank you, Selim.

238
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,820
Not bad.

239
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,860
Thank you for the compliment!

240
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,570
You fell for it!

241
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,610
What do you think?

242
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,330
It's something you humans can't do, isn't it?

243
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,200
Now... do you want to be strangled to death?

244
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,750
Or bitten to death...

245
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,920
Or cut to death?

246
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,670
Actually...

247
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,900
You're cheap, kicking dirt into my eyes...

248
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,530
There have been many assassination attempts on me, ever since I was little.

249
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,900
I've had to learn a few cheap tricks of my own.

250
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,870
What do you say? Can't you just give up and turn yourself in?

251
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,330
I just want information about immortality.

252
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,500
You don't want to get hurt, do you?

253
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,080
You little shit!

254
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,170
You're just a human! Don't be looking down on me!

255
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,090
Don't underestimate humans, Homunculus!

256
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,170
Okay! Got him!

257
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,510
That was dangerous, geez...

258
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,350
Dammit, you...

259
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,560
I'm not allowed to eat you guys!

260
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,810
I want to eat that guy with the thin eyes!

261
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,230
Got him!

262
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,030
Hey now, don't be interfering with--

263
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,700
You're a human, after all.

264
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,080
Now, Gluttony!

265
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:05,870
Lin!

266
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:06,710
What?!

267
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,500
Dammit! I can't let him swallow human sacrifices!

268
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,050
Brother!

269
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,740
I swallowed them.

270
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,450
Brother! Lin!

271
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,080
Hey, spit him out! Spit out my brother!

272
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,750
I can't. I swallowed them.

273
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,210
No way...

274
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,340
You're fine, right, Brother?

275
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:09,940
I've got the rooms my wife and kids used to live in, but if I have too many lights on, the neighbors will get suspicious.

276
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,900
You're going to have to sleep in my bed.

277
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,110
I... I have to go to the young master...

278
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,280
Moron!

279
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,780
What can you do in that state?!

280
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,630
He still hasn't returned yet?

281
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,210
Got it.

282
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,760
Then I'll be on my way to Headquarters.

283
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,510
Yes. Thank you.

284
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,930
We're going.

285
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:45,720
Roger.

286
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:47,640
To where?

287
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,150
I need to find out who's on our side and who's not.

288
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,860
Geez, the whole lot of you...

289
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:00,400
You're still going to push yourself,
even though your wound hasn't healed yet?

290
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,910
The Führer President might be a Homunculus.

291
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,410
I can't just sit around.

292
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:07,990
Also...

293
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,660
We just left some kids on the battlefield.

294
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:16,250
I'll be setting a bad example as
an adult if I don't take action now!

295
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,470
What's so funny?

296
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,470
Nothing.

297
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:27,850
I was just thinking about how mad Edward would be if he knew you were treating him like a child.

298
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,350
I was just repeating your words, you know.

299
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
But still, I'm amazed.

300
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,650
I would have never expected you to take such a bold step.

301
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,980
It isn't bold at all.

302
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,150
I'm just trying to clear the field.

303
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,280
Also...

304
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,200
Have a lot of people who understand and are willing to support you.

305
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:53,710
It's a little late, but I'm going to take his advice.

306
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:09,930
This could either be the gates of glory or an entrance to a den of evil...

307
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,140
You wait here, Lieutenant.

308
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,980
If something happens to me, I want you to get out of here.

309
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,650
I refuse.

310
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,310
This is an order.

311
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,070
I cannot comply.

312
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,860
You're quite the stubborn one...

313
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,320
You should know that by now.

314
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:27,950
Fine.

315
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,240
I'll definitely come back, so wait for me here.

316
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,410
Yes, sir! Good luck!

317
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,830
So you're Roy Mustang, eh?

318
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,960
I got a call from my wife earlier.

319
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,300
Lieutenant General Raven! I deeply apologize for not coming to introduce myself to you due to duties.

320
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,720
Also, I'm terribly sorry for visiting you at this hour!

321
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,430
I don't mind.

322
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,470
How's the old geezer Grumman doing these days?

323
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:54,980
He's doing fine.

324
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,310
Check.

325
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,190
I'm beat.

326
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,820
That's eleven losses in a row.

327
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,320
Make that twelve.

328
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,490
Well, I guess you put up a good fight this round.

329
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,820
You started to lose your touch right after you started to think you had a chance.

330
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,080
So you're saying I let up?

331
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,250
That's right. You're not able to become heartless.

332
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,040
Just like Raven.

333
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,670
General Raven...

334
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:18,580
From Central?

335
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,790
He's exceptional, but very soft-hearted.

336
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:28,300
There was a case where he ran in to rescue one of his men, who was injured, and ended up disrupting his formation.

337
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,100
If he's like that, he'll need a lot of men on his side.

338
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,470
W-What an insult!

339
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:37,600
I was employed at Central because of the way I treat my men!

340
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:41,060
A geezer out on the frontier has no right to say that about me!

341
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,070
M-My apologies...

342
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,650
Please don't let it get to you.

343
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:52,160
Also, seeing how you got angry at this,
you must be a man of justice.

344
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,580
Lieutenant General Grumman told me I should go to you in times of trouble.

345
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,920
So that sly dog one-upped me again, huh...

346
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,760
Oh, it's almost time for the meeting.

347
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,220
I'll accompany you.

348
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,220
Have you gotten used to Central?

349
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,980
Not quite. I'm trying to bring myself to talk with the people more, but...

350
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,480
They've got rumors flying around all over the place, don't they?

351
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,980
But most of those rumors are nonsensical.

352
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:32,490
Something about Scar feeding a cat, immortal beings, and...

353
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:37,580
...something about the Führer President being a Homunculus.

354
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,750
You don't have a great sense of humor, do you?

355
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,000
Did you really work under Grumman?

356
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,880
I guess I didn't pick that up from him.

357
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:54,390
Well, even gossip like that may end up entertaining everyone.

358
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:57,060
Huh? Am I really allowed to...

359
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,160
So, about that earlier joke...

360
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,450
About the Führer President being a Homunculus...

361
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,450
I'd like you to continue.

362
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,460
What's the matter, Colonel Mustang?

363
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:28,210
What about me being a Homunculus?

364
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,720
Is there a problem?

365
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:39,720
Oh, now I get it, Hughes...

366
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,100
When you said that the army was in danger...

367
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,190
...you didn't mean a crisis was approaching the army...

368
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,820
You meant that the army itself was in a crisis.

369
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,110
Fullmetal.

370
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,860
Looks like I've arrived at the depths of hell.

371
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,290
Where am I...

372
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:06,880
Blood?

373
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,790
What?

374
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,010
What is this place?

375
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,300
Al!

376
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,880
Hey, isn't anyone here?!

377
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,060
Where the hell am I?!

378
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:37,380
Tsuyogaranakute iindane

379
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:37,380
I don't have to act tough, right?

380
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:44,180
The scribbling someone made...

381
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:44,180
Dareka ga kaitetta

382
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:49,980
On the wall, of a flower is swaying.

383
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:49,980
Kabe no rakugaki no hana ga yureru

384
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,560
No one knows their true selves.

385
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,560
Jibunrashisa nante dermo wakaranaiyo

386
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,860
Even though we both lose and gain

387
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,860
Nagai nagai michi no tochuu de

388
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,280
By embarking on this long, long path,

389
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,280
Nakushitari hirottari

390
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:08,950
And though there may be days loneliness strikes and makes us weep...

391
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:08,950
Kyuu ni samishikunatte naichau hi mo arukedo

392
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:16,460
Let's transform our tears and pains to stars.

393
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:16,460
Namida mo itami mo hoshi ni kaeyou

394
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:22,460
Let's light a candle to illuminate our tomorrow.

395
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:22,460
Ashita wo terasu akari wo tomosou

396
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,590
And we'll hold our small hands over the fire to create stardust,

397
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,590
Chiisana te kazashite futari de tsukurou

398
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:32,810
And an eternity that shines so brilliantly.

399
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:32,810
Hoshikuzu wo tsuyoku hikaru eien wo

400
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:38,190
Farewells may be unavoidable,

401
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:38,190
Sayonara itsuka wa kurukamoshirenai

402
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:44,110
Yet the seasons continue to change obliviously.

403
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:44,110
Kisetsu wa soredemo meguri megutteku

404
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,200
Chiisaku mayottemo aruiteku

405
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,200
Even if I lose myself, I'll continue to walk...

406
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,240
Walk by your side.

407
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,240
Kimi to aruiteku

408
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,540
That's the only thing I'd like to never change.

409
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,540
Sore dake wa kawaranaideiyoune

410
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:04,850
Do people search for the lost because they fear being alone?

411
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:09,480
But even if he can't see them, he won't give up.

412
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,190
Because he believes.

413
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,780
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

414
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:20,540
Doorway of Darkness

415
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:20,540
Episode 25, Doorway of Darkness.

416
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,120
Don't look at me.

417
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,450
Don't look at this figure.
