1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:05,150
The sun is male, and represents a man...

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:08,230
And the moon is female; representing a woman.

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:13,200
When the sun and the moon come together, they become one...

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,370
...in other words, it represents a perfect being.

5
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,370
When they say "perfect being", are they talking about immortality?

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,620
My guess is that it's something even more incredible.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,750
Like?

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,420
Like... God.

9
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,550
That's right, come!

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,010
I shall no longer be chained down by You!

11
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:45,730
I shall drag You down to earth and make You a part of me!

12
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,120
Is everyone okay?

13
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,040
What just happened?!

14
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,620
A job well done, my dear sacrifices.

15
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,550
So you actually did it...!

16
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,630
Yes, I've obtained God.

17
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,260
'God', you say?!

18
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,640
Cut the bullshit-

19
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,680
It's possible.

20
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,350
If you're in possession of a tremendous amount of energy, that is.

21
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,520
Energy?

22
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,230
A philosopher's stone!

23
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,150
You're joking!

24
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,440
So you mean, everyone has already been turned into a philosopher's stone?!

25
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,240
Just how many lives were lost...?

26
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,990
There are roughly 50 million people in this nation.

27
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,930
He Who Would
Swallow God

28
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,080
Son of a bitch!

29
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,920
Shit!

30
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,840
I've sealed off alchemy.

31
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,930
Farewell, my friends.

32
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,470
That's...!

33
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,520
Now that I've devoured God,

34
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,980
it's not impossible for me to create a sun in the palm of my hand.

35
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,280
Should I let this loose right here and now?

36
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:11,080
The turnabout had already begun from the moment you were in possession of Him.

37
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,590
For this day and for this day only,

38
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,930
I had positioned my friends,
my philosopher's stones, all across the nation...

39
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,390
...over a long period of time and with many calculations.

40
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,690
The time has come.

41
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:41,450
He did something he shouldn't have done.

42
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,450
We no longer have a body to return to.

43
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,950
However, the people of Amestris do.

44
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:55,710
Yes. Let us return their souls to their respective bodies.

45
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,960
Hohenheim asked us to, after all.

46
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,800
So all you did was to implant your philosopher's stones.

47
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,850
But those are just points.

48
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,470
Without a circle, there is no alchemy.

49
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,470
That's a basic principle of alchemy.

50
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,560
But there IS a circle.

51
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:20,990
A huge, powerful circle that'll activate by itself even if something were to happen to me!

52
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:27,120
The shadow of the moon that occurs from the solar eclipse!

53
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,750
We'll be going on ahead, Hohenheim!

54
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:42,760
You just continue to get in my way,
don't you, Hohenheim?!

55
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,430
That's precisely what I came here to do,

56
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,760
Dwarf in the Flask, Homunculus!

57
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,350
Winry... are you okay?

58
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,810
What... just happened?

59
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,780
Did we lose consciousness?

60
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,030
It happened to you two as well?

61
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,860
Looks like it.

62
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,030
But that was...

63
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,450
How can I explain it... it was as if...

64
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,370
It felt like I was drowning in a whirlpool of suffering.

65
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,380
Did it work?

66
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,590
The souls of the people of Amestris were returned to their respective bodies.

67
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:57,310
He shouldn't be able to restrain this being he calls 'God' with only the souls of the people of Xerxes.

68
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,110
I can just create another philosopher's stone.

69
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,070
A hundred million, or even a billion!

70
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,490
Humans, an energy form, are an unlimited source!

71
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:29,970
May!

72
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:35,430
It's as easy as pie for an Eastern Alchemist to read and utilize the flow of the earth's energy!

73
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:41,310
The more power he has, the more power we have that we can use as well!

74
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,900
Sir, look out!

75
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,820
Dammit!

76
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,280
I don't have enough time to offset the energy!

77
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,700
Please hold out!

78
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,370
The defense circle will be destroyed!

79
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,460
It's impossible!

80
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,420
Stand firm, Dad!

81
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,800
You bastard, don't you dare give up!

82
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,260
Uh-oh.

83
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,810
I'm a terrible father, but I want to make you two proud!

84
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,730
If we don't hurry up, the philosopher's stone inside of Dad will run out!

85
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,740
Hurry up, Scar!

86
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,990
Ishbalan,

87
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,870
I thought that alchemy, the reconstruction of matter,

88
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,960
was a sin against Ishvala, the creator of all!

89
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,340
Have you abandoned your god?!

90
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,010
It seems as though...

91
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,100
...'God' is hardly significant to you all!

92
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,230
Nay!

93
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,690
After you learned the true meaning of despair...

94
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,820
...during the Ishbalan War...!

95
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,710
You must have realized somewhere inside of your heart!

96
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,710
God does not exist!

97
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:08,210
I believed in neither destiny nor a god,

98
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:14,000
but one would probably look at this situation and say that the heavens are not on my side.

99
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,470
The heavens brought forth a fitting visitor.

100
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,350
So you're here to avenge your grandfather...

101
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,980
That's fine as well.

102
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,650
Any last words?

103
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:34,980
Nay.

104
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,780
A sad life you led.

105
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:43,580
King Bradley, was there no one you loved?

106
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,540
Friends? Your wife?

107
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,460
Wife, eh...

108
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,960
You have no words to pass on to her?!

109
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,710
If she found out that you were a homunculus...!

110
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:59,420
Brat, quit blabbering on about trifling topics such as love and sadness.

111
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,550
Don't underestimate us.

112
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,510
She's the woman I chose.

113
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,980
A will is unnecessary between us.

114
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,770
That's usually how it is between a King and his companion.

115
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:24,740
Seems like you missed the chance to take revenge as you were caught up in foolish dialogue...

116
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:36,170
Although my life was lived atop a rail which was already prepared for me...

117
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:39,970
Thanks to you humans...

118
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:48,020
...I feel like my life was somewhat worthwhile...

119
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,780
A sign of life?

120
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,070
It's a philosopher's stone.

121
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,240
This?

122
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,080
Are you all right?!

123
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,170
Please take me to that spot...

124
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,960
The transmutation circle is broken!

125
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,260
It doesn't matter!

126
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,930
That's the center of it all...!

127
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:23,840
Got it.

128
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:37,110
Dear brother, to tell you the truth, I am not completely rid of hatred.

129
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:42,740
Yet, I'm currently trying to help the ones
whom my hatred is directed at: the Amestrians.

130
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:47,740
You once related it to the flow of positives and negatives,

131
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,910
but where will I, who carry both of those conflicting elements,

132
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,670
be carried off to?!

133
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,180
There it is!

134
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,490
Serves you right.

135
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,700
That chair you've been sitting high and mighty on is now in pieces.

136
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,250
You've had your share of fun for your lifetime, bitch.

137
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:43,010
I'll beat the shit out of both you and Truth!

138
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,850
Was that... Eastern Alchemy?

139
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:57,520
No, it's something my brother invented.

140
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,400
He used to research alchemy.

141
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:06,530
And from there, he began to research Eastern Alchemy from Xing.

142
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:11,530
Eastern Alchemy utilizes the flow of earth's energy.

143
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,830
Alchemy from Amestris utilizes tectonic energy.

144
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,540
But my brother realized...

145
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,880
...that alchemists are unable to use all of that power.

146
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:30,930
There's something in the way between the alchemist and the tectonic energy.

147
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,220
That feeling I got when I first came to this country...

148
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:38,390
...it felt as though there were people crawling about underground.

149
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,150
Right.

150
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:45,860
It's probably the philosopher's stones that were stretched across underground.

151
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,040
So Sir, the purpose of your transmutation circle was to return everyone's souls to their bodies?

152
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,880
Yeah, it worked out.

153
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:09,380
And the purpose of the Turnabout Transmutation Circle Scar activated was to fix this nation's alchemy.

154
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:16,180
After extensive research, Scar's brother began to doubt this nation's alchemy,

155
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,690
and additionally, learned of the existence of the Nationwide Transmutation Circle.

156
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,650
And with that at its base, and utilizing Eastern Alchemy for inscription,

157
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:30,530
he created the Turnabout Transmutation Circle; one that would nullify the power of a philosopher's stone.

158
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:36,280
And with this, alchemists are able to use all the tectonic energy to their liking,

159
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,950
something that used to be disrupted by philosopher's stones.

160
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,800
Keep it up!

161
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,180
Make him use his philosopher's stone!

162
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,390
He'll eventually run out of energy!

163
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,470
And when'll that be?!

164
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,470
I don't know!

165
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,310
But all we can do is try!

166
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,770
Eat this!

167
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,110
This brings back memories.

168
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,530
I remember bathing in that once.

169
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,240
Why don't you take a soak too?

170
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,790
Out of the way, Greed!

171
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:37,850
Freeze!

172
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,520
Now, slowly...

173
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,400
Lieutenant Hawkeye?

174
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,650
Major!

175
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,250
He must have gone up to create more philosopher's stones.

176
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,590
We're going after him.

177
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,170
Right!

178
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,380
We'll get you somewhere safe too.

179
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,970
Sorry about this.

180
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,300
Why am I so useless when people need me the most?

181
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,550
Brother!

182
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,220
You go on ahead, Al!

183
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,520
Seems like he wants a piece of me.

184
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,110
Let's go, Al.

185
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,400
Don't die now, Ed!

186
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:34,780
Yes'm!

187
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,200
Dear!

188
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,620
Izumi!

189
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,830
We don't have time for this.

190
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,870
Take care of the colonel.

191
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,880
Right!

192
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,130
Colonel!

193
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,130
There's someone that needs a real good spanking, so I'll be off!

194
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,300
Are you injured, Colonel?

195
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,010
They took my vision.

196
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,230
What about your wounds, Lieutenant?

197
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,600
Seriously...!

198
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,810
Please worry about yourself!

199
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:11,270
Your eyes...!

200
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,030
Can you still fight?

201
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,910
Yes!

202
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,120
Young master!

203
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,210
It's Greed.

204
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,130
Geez, you followed us all the way down-

205
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,590
Wrath!

206
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,600
So he bit the dust...

207
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,230
You look so damn satisfied.

208
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,440
Pisses me off.

209
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,020
Greed...!

210
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,730
Throwing away his pride as a homunculus... how pathetic.

211
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:59,320
Why are you guys so obedient towards a father like that?

212
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,320
What a stupid question.

213
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,830
Isn't it obvious that we'd obey our own father?

214
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,830
You're the stupid one here.

215
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,040
"Obvious" you say?

216
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,590
You won't even try thinking with your own brain!

217
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,920
I don't get it...

218
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,090
Why do you continue to obey him?

219
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:28,430
He doesn't give a damn even if you're badly hurt like that.

220
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,900
So what?!

221
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:39,860
Don't apply this "common knowledge" of your human race to us homunculi!

222
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,000
This container won't last for very much longer.

223
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:55,540
But since you, like our father,
have Hohenheim's blood in your veins,

224
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,500
we're pretty much siblings.

225
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,550
Edward Elric, give me your body...

226
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,340
...a container!

227
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,430
What?!

228
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,100
Unamused.

229
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,980
I'm thoroughly unamused, homunculus Pride.

230
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,610
Kimblee?! There's no way!

231
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:24,240
How could you maintain your own self-awareness in this tempest of souls...?!

232
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,450
Tempest?

233
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,410
You make me giggle.

234
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,870
Voices of resentment are like a lullaby to me.

235
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,210
Why are you interfering with me, Kimblee?!

236
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:45,340
Well, I wouldn't have done anything had you kept on fighting while conserving your pride as a homunculus.

237
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:49,850
However, first, you blab on about your pride as a homunculus,

238
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,980
then just as your life is in danger,

239
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:58,310
you proceed to escape into the container of a human, a being you looked down on as inferior.

240
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,230
You...

241
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,480
...lack elegance.

242
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,540
I'm going to be killed!

243
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:16,670
You don't understand Edward Elric!

244
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,300
Selim!!

245
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,550
Impossible...!

246
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:31,640
He turned himself into a philosopher's stone to infiltrate me?!

247
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,640
I've got you now, Selim!

248
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,270
Stop...

249
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,110
Stop...!

250
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:47,610
Please, stop!!

251
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,130
So this is your true self.

252
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:14,310
I'd better go and apologize to Madam Bradley after all this is over.

253
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:18,770
Just wait there, stupid brat.

254
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:27,360
Mommy... Mommy...

255
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:44,180
Ever since that day passed,

256
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:44,180
Ano hi kara zutto

257
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:48,430
I promised myself that I'd never cry.

258
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:48,430
Nakanaito kimetekitakedo

259
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:53,980
But even while I hoarded up the pain,

260
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:53,980
Itami wo kasanetemo

261
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:59,090
there was something I couldn't forgive myself for.

262
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:59,090
Nanika wo yurusezu ni ita

263
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,530
I'll never be able

264
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,530
Mou modorenai

265
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:05,030
to return to those days.

266
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:05,030
Ikutsumo no hibi

267
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:10,120
Boku wa mada nanimo dekizuni

268
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:10,120
I'm still powerless.

269
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:15,370
I watch as the shards of memories disappear, one by one;

270
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:15,370
Kimi no ita kioku no kakera

271
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:21,240
memories of when you were still with me.

272
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:21,240
Mata hitotsu kieteyuku

273
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,260
I long to become

274
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,260
Kyou yori motto

275
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:27,010
stronger than I am now,

276
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:27,010
Tsuyoku naritai

277
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:32,150
Kono koe ga itsuka todokuyouni

278
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:32,150
so that my voice will eventually reach you.

279
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,520
If the wind happens to stop

280
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,520
Arukitsuzukete

281
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,230
in the midst of my long journey,

282
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,230
Kaze ga yandara

283
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:41,940
I'll look up at the sky in search of you.

284
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:41,940
Kimi wo sagashite sora miageruyo

285
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:49,280
Beyond the daybreak, a ray of light breaks free.

286
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:49,280
Yoake no saki ni hikari ga sasuyo

287
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:54,830
A rainbow spans across the sky.

288
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:54,830
Niji ga kakaruyo

289
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:01,540
The strong arms roars; the flame thunders forth.

290
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,540
Staking their existence, the people give their full measure!

291
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,800
Yes! The final battle is now here!

292
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:15,510
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

293
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:20,020
Episode 62, A Fierce Counterattack.

294
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:20,030
A Fierce Counterattack

295
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:24,740
If one wishes to gain something,
one must present something of equal value.
