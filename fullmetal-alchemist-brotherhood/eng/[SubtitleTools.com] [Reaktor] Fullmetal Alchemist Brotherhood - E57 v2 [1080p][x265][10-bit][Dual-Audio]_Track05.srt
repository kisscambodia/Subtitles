1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,150
The new morning we've finally found

2
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,150
Yatto mitsuketa atarashii asa wa

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,190
is being hampered by the past.

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,190
Tsukihi ga jama wo suru

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,660
What we chased after wasn't the future,

6
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,660
Mukau saki wa tsugi ja nakute

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,490
but the past so full of remorse.

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,490
Sugi bakari oikaketa

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,960
Nariyamanai yousha nai omoide tachi wa

10
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,960
The ruthless memories won't stop playing;

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,050
they won't be forgiving us for a long time.

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,050
Yurushite kuresou nimonai

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,890
It's about now that a teardrop

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,890
Sorosoro kana tesaguri tsukareta hoho wo

15
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,560
beings to roll down my fatigued cheeks.

16
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,560
Kattou ga koboreochiru

17
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,810
Will this rain ever stop?

18
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,810
Ame wa itsuka yamunodeshouka

19
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:52,030
Zuibun nagai aida tsumetai

20
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:52,030
I've been freezing for a long time.

21
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,320
Why does the rain continue to fix on me?

22
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,320
Ame wa doushite boku wo erabuno

23
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,080
I wonder if it could embrace me.

24
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,080
Tsutsumarete iikana

25
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,870
Today, the rain falls again;

26
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,870
Ame wa yamu koto wo shirazuni

27
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,090
endlessly it falls knowing no end.

28
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,090
Kyou mo furitsuzukukeredo

29
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,130
Sotto sashidashita kasa no naka de

30
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,130
We nestle close to each other to share the warmth

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:28,850
under this umbrella, you gently held out to me.

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:28,850
Nukumori ni yorisoinagara

33
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,370
The Führer President has returned?!

34
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,210
I heard he destroyed a tank from Briggs at the main gate.

35
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,510
That'll show those monkeys from Briggs!

36
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,220
Let's gather the rest of the soldiers.

37
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,720
We need to recapture mission headquarters!

38
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,010
Yeah!

39
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,720
The Führer President is at the main gate?

40
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:08,940
Oh.

41
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,400
It's my first time seeing him with my own eyes.

42
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:21,070
So he's the one who ripped off my granddaughter's arm...!

43
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,090
Eternal Leave

44
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,910
I see.

45
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:33,500
So you were planning on sacrificing all the civilians
so that you high-level officials would gain immortality,

46
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,210
and unify the world.

47
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,090
Is Führer President Bradley doing everything
even with the knowledge of what you all are up to?

48
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,010
He's the leader of this country,
and was made for that purpose.

49
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,520
Why are you hesitating?!

50
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,520
We're planning on creating a world without war!

51
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,150
So you're saying the world should be destroyed once for that purpose?

52
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,740
It's not destruction, but rather regeneration.

53
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,620
It's the 'reconstruction' stage that you alchemists refer to.

54
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,950
The civilians aren't going to be given 'death'.

55
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,120
They're going to receive the honor of living within us forever!

56
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,130
And we're going to unify the world together!

57
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,630
All is one, and one is all!

58
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,340
We, the chosen ones of Amestris, will become one and-

59
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,140
You heard him.

60
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,520
What will you guys do?

61
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,520
They're trying to gain everything for themselves.

62
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,520
Are you just going to let him go?

63
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,560
C-Come along with me, you all.

64
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,480
If you do, I'll ask that man to-

65
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:49,750
I'm a soldier, so I must obey the orders of my superiors.

66
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,870
But to be honest, I don't know what to believe anymore...

67
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,880
You're still hesitating in this situation?

68
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,090
Obeying a superior you can't even believe doesn't make you loyal.

69
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,340
You're just fooling yourself.

70
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,770
Believe in yourselves.

71
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:16,020
Just choose a way of living that won't shame your soul.

72
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,950
I have family in the city.

73
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,580
So do I.

74
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,750
I, too, as well.

75
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,640
Brigadier General,

76
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,770
this is our answer.

77
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,030
Mission headquarters, what's the situation?

78
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,200
Not too great.

79
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,240
The Central Soldiers have begun to recover in several areas.

80
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,410
Where are you right now, General?

81
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,790
The Führer President's office.

82
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,750
And the survivors?

83
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,920
We haven't been able to get in touch with our men who are around the office.

84
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,800
There's a high possibility that there are many Central Soldiers surrounding it.

85
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,920
Roger.

86
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,800
If things get dangerous over there, run.

87
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,640
Just leave me behind.

88
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,020
Aye, Ma'am.

89
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,690
Now, this place has become filled with enemies again.

90
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:42,730
It's only a matter of time until the Central Soldiers form up and storm this place.

91
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,610
Which means...

92
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,370
After going down a bit,

93
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,960
I'll dig a side tunnel as an escape route, just like I did when I came here.

94
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,920
Escape...

95
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,000
Why don't we escape together?

96
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,050
You all could probably use some time to recover and plan, couldn't you?

97
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,400
He's close.

98
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,610
You think so too?

99
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,280
You two can sense him?

100
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,030
It's more of a "bad feeling".

101
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,910
Like the feeling you get when a bad scar starts aching.

102
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,690
Oh my, do I have guests?

103
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,900
I'm a little nervous.

104
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,070
Who are you?!

105
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,990
Me?

106
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,580
Hmm...

107
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,250
The man who created King Bradley...

108
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,380
...perhaps?

109
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,880
The Führer President...

110
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,840
Which means you're on their side.

111
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,100
Huh? You're...

112
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:42,350
I thought you were at the radio station,
but you actually took the effort to come here.

113
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:46,360
Thanks for giving me one less thing to do, Mustang.

114
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,240
Guys, entertain them for a while.

115
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,580
Who the hell are they?!

116
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,370
Dolls?!

117
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,460
No...

118
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,380
Their movements clearly differ from the dolls!

119
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,630
They're men who might have become King Bradley.

120
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,180
They were gathered as soon as they were born,

121
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,970
and they were given special education and training

122
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:20,560
for the sole purpose of becoming the Führer President.

123
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:27,150
And with the twelfth experiment, King Bradley was born.

124
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,690
So these are...!

125
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,490
The leftovers.

126
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,330
Despite that, they've been training for battle all this time.

127
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:47,040
Although they're not as powerful as King Bradley,

128
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,790
they're pretty good.

129
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,150
Damn...

130
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,410
...those rebels...!

131
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,870
Shit, I passed out.

132
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,000
Captain!

133
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,620
That's right...

134
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:31,550
If I were to pull it out, I'd probably die from blood loss.

135
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,140
Bradley...!

136
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,520
That was close, old man!

137
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,020
It was an accident, youn-

138
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,940
It wasn't on purpose!

139
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:57,650
You-

140
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,960
As I thought, prey like you gets my heart pumping faster.

141
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:27,140
I'm surprised you put up such a good fight despite being more aged than I.

142
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,690
But...!

143
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,730
It ends here!

144
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,490
Gramps!

145
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,410
The prince from Xing, eh?

146
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,670
Dammit, Lin!

147
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,670
Quit taking over without asking!

148
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:59,010
You're just like the girl who cut her own arm off.

149
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:04,430
Just like her, you endanger your life for something you can't throw away.

150
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,560
Young master...

151
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,770
I can no longer fight. Just throw me away...

152
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,100
Quit joking!

153
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,310
Are you telling me to become a man like him?!

154
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,610
A king exists for his people.

155
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,150
Without his people, there is no king.

156
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:22,700
He's planning on abandoning the people of his country.

157
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,740
That's not someone I want to become!

158
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,710
A man unworthy of being called 'king', huh...

159
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,880
Then we must defeat him.

160
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,800
Don't speak!

161
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,800
Take a break!

162
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,690
I agree.

163
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:52,940
I'll take a break...

164
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,940
I shall rest.

165
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,480
Harden, Greed!

166
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,820
Protect the young master's body!

167
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,200
R-Right!

168
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:05,870
Young master...

169
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,450
Become king.

170
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,630
It's time for this old geezer to begin his eternal rest!

171
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:20,300
Idiot!!

172
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,970
You're coming to hell with me,

173
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,600
Bradley!!

174
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:47,820
I can't give him a single wound, even by risking my life?

175
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,660
Young master...

176
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:55,710
I'm so sorry...

177
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,420
Even if you possess the eyes of God,

178
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,930
you can't possibly dodge an attack coming from somewhere you can't see!

179
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,310
Old man, I'll... be going...

180
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:19,690
to hell with you...

181
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:25,650
I'm so grateful...

182
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,020
Grandpa!!!

183
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:07,950
Jesus!

184
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,780
First you get stuck in a ditch,
then you ram into a lightpost?!

185
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,950
You really suck at driving!

186
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,120
Shut it!

187
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,910
Be thankful that we were able to get this far in a beat up car like that!

188
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,250
We've come this far! Stop fighting!

189
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,210
Anyway, we need to hurry up and find a place where we can get underground.

190
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,880
That's...

191
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,810
Colonel Mustang?

192
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,640
I hope they're doing well.

193
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,560
Brother...

194
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,560
Let's hurry!

195
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:57,040
How non-human can your movements get?!

196
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,780
Colonel, your back is wide open.

197
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,740
There's someone I've entrusted my back to, so yeah.

198
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,630
The gate of truth.

199
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,750
Human transmutation, a taboo in alchemy.

200
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:53,010
Alchemists who try it end up opening the gate of truth,

201
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,970
paying a befitting toll.

202
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:03,190
So that's how the Elric Brothers sacrificed their bodies?

203
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:04,650
Did you do it too?

204
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,280
They took a bit of my insides.

205
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:14,070
But what I learned from all that,

206
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:20,330
is that human transmutation never works.

207
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,380
Oh my, soldiers like yourselves probably aren't interested in tales like these.

208
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,260
Not true.

209
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:36,800
Humans who have opened the gate of truth are the "human sacrifices" they speak of.

210
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,020
You may have a handhold in finding out what they are up to.

211
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,100
So you all had someone you wanted to see again,

212
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:50,940
even if you had to open the gate of truth and sacrifice your body.

213
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,740
What about you?

214
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:00,700
Do you have someone that you'd give up anything for just to see again?

215
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,790
Now that's something that means nothing to a soldier.

216
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,750
Having regret for the deceased is pointless.

217
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,750
We fight in order to keep them alive.

218
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,630
That's true.

219
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,220
But...

220
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,850
...I feel like I understand something now.

221
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,350
Edward Elric.

222
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:28,230
When I first met him, I threatened him and told him to tell me everything he knows,

223
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:33,860
but that boy didn't say a word about his old friend having been taken hostage.

224
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,570
Just one line:

225
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,490
"Please try to realize."

226
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:43,040
Those eyes were different from those of us soldiers,

227
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,290
or even those of State Alchemists,
who are referred to as the dogs of the military.

228
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,880
If I had to say, they were eyes that didn't want to lose anything important to them again no matter what...

229
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,640
Eyes of an unreasonable child?

230
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,350
I'd be lying if I said that those straightforward eyes didn't move my heart.

231
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:15,280
But will those naïvely honest feelings of his
find a way out of the difficulty in this fight,

232
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,360
or will they come back to harm him?

233
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,530
There.

234
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,580
Let us begin.

235
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,670
Number 16,

236
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:32,920
Number 17,

237
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,920
Number 21,

238
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,430
Number 23, Number 26.

239
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,050
Come here.

240
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:43,930
What?!

241
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,190
Here we go!

242
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,370
What did you do?!

243
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:08,910
This is just the first step.

244
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:15,590
Do you know how many alchemy research facilities under direct control of the Führer President exist in Central?

245
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:20,340
There should be four that are currently being used...

246
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,510
No!

247
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,680
Research Laboratory 5...

248
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,310
There are five!

249
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,980
A transmutation circle with five points!

250
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:40,030
Could it be that the curving underground path was a circle that connects the research facilities?!

251
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,590
What?!

252
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,930
What's wrong, Mr. Heinkel?

253
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,360
Izumi.

254
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,200
Yeah.

255
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,330
Seems like this is a good spot.

256
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:33,870
I'm going to dig a hole for escape purposes in this wall.

257
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,330
Stand back.

258
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,880
Then this is where we say goodbye.

259
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,800
We still need to remain here and fight.

260
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:47,220
From here on out is probably the enemy's backbone.

261
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:51,020
We can't just let our chance to ambush them go to waste.

262
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,390
You...

263
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,530
Thanks for all your help.

264
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,660
We're in your debt, Izumi Curtis.

265
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,410
I should be saying that, Major General Arm-

266
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,320
What?!

267
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,830
Alphonse!

268
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,460
Izumi!

269
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,630
Izumi!!

270
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,350
F-Fullmetal...!

271
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:26,360
Dammit...!!

272
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,840
Ever since that day passed,

273
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,840
Ano hi kara zutto

274
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,090
I promised myself that I'd never cry.

275
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,090
Nakanaito kimetekitakedo

276
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:51,640
But even while I hoarded up the pain,

277
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:51,640
Itami wo kasanetemo

278
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,750
there was something I couldn't forgive myself for.

279
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,750
Nanika wo yurusezu ni ita

280
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,190
I'll never be able

281
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,190
Mou modorenai

282
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,690
to return to those days.

283
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,690
Ikutsumo no hibi

284
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:07,780
I'm still powerless.

285
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:07,780
Boku wa mada nanimo dekizuni

286
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:13,030
I watch as the shards of memories disappear, one by one;

287
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:13,030
Kimi no ita kioku no kakera

288
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:18,900
memories of when you were still with me.

289
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:18,900
Mata hitotsu kieteyuku

290
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,920
I long to become

291
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,920
Kyou yori motto

292
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,670
stronger than I am now,

293
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,670
Tsuyoku naritai

294
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:29,810
so that my voice will eventually reach you.

295
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:29,810
Kono koe ga itsuka todokuyouni

296
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:32,180
If the wind happens to stop

297
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:32,180
Arukitsuzukete

298
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,890
in the midst of my long journey,

299
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,890
Kaze ga yandara

300
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:39,600
I'll look up at the sky in search of you.

301
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:39,600
Kimi wo sagashite sora miageruyo

302
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:46,940
Beyond the daybreak, a ray of light breaks free.

303
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:46,940
Yoake no saki ni hikari ga sasuyo

304
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:52,490
A rainbow spans across the sky.

305
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:52,490
Niji ga kakaruyo

306
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:02,790
Anger is born at the extremities of sorrow,

307
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:07,210
and when two souls dwell within a single body,

308
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,760
the annihilations begins.

309
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,680
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

310
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:20,200
Episode 58, Sacrifices.

311
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:20,200
Sacrifices

312
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:26,110
Continuing to protect even after death is their long-cherished plan.
