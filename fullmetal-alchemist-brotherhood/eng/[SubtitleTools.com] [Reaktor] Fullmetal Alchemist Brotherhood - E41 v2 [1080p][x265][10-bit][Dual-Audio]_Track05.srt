1
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:23,460
We sigh whenever we're about to come to a standstill

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:23,460
Owarinaki tabi no tochuu tachidomarisouna toki

3
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,710
While moving on this endless journey.

4
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,710
Fukai tameiki kobosu bokura wa

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,430
Everytime we lunge for it, it escapes and flies off.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,430
Tsukamikaketewa mata hanareteitta

7
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,850
But now, there's nothing to be afraid of

8
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,850
Demo ima wa mou nanimo osoreru koto wa nai

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,780
The powerful ties that bind our hearts

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,780
Kokoro wo tsunagu tsuyoi kizuna wa

11
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,240
Keshite hodoke wa shinai sa

12
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,240
Will never come loose.

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,960
After a lifetime of searching, we finally arrived

14
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,960
Sagashitsuzukete tadoritsuita

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,760
Here, where the period lies.

16
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,760
Kono basho de piriodo ni

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:23,060
Let's change all our sorrow and rage to power.

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:23,060
Kanashimi ikari chikara ni kaete

19
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,980
Destiny is right within our reach.

20
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,980
Unmei wa sugu soba ni

21
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,410
It's almost like a maze in here.

22
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,370
Try not to get lost.

23
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,450
Okay.

24
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,460
Oww...

25
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,080
Are you okay?

26
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,630
Sorry.

27
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,920
What's this?

28
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,260
D-Dynamite!

29
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,260
Seriously?!

30
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,680
They're all damp now.

31
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,480
Don't worry; they won't explode.

32
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,850
Come on; get a move on.

33
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,650
We don't know when the enemy will come after us.

34
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,440
Right.

35
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,280
Looks like the blizzard died down.

36
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,250
Get ready.

37
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,120
Aye, sir.

38
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:34,630
We're going to take down Kimblee and his
two men from Central when we see an opening.

39
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,880
Aye, sir.

40
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,910
The Abyss

41
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,730
We're going to proceed with the mission with only the men currently present.

42
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,610
Don't tell anyone; not even soldiers from Northern Headquarters.

43
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,150
Hey-

44
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,820
Major Miles!

45
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,910
By "bring down", do you mean you're going to kill them?!

46
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,910
Of course.

47
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,370
I don't approve killing.

48
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,580
It's better to seal their abilities and beat information out of them.

49
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,080
Do you really think he'll tell the truth?

50
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,040
It's dangerous to keep him alive.

51
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,800
Then what about his men?

52
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,720
They may also be obeying him without choice after being turned into chimeras!

53
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,220
You have a point, but the keyword here is "may".

54
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,390
So you're going to kill them simply based on suspicion?

55
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,850
Same with Lieutenant General Raven! There were plenty of other methods-

56
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,900
Do not forget the law of Briggs.

57
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,860
If you let your guard down, you die.

58
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:43,110
Your softness may come back to kill you or one of your friends someday.

59
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,450
We don't need careless men in this land.

60
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,750
We're going to get rid of Kimblee and his two men.

61
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,710
I guess he's still a kid, after all.

62
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,970
Yeah.

63
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,640
Trying to settle matters without deaths in this world is a soft idea in itself.

64
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,760
But there was a time I was like that, as well.

65
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,270
I was, too.

66
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,520
You start to understand once you reach this age after living through many battles...

67
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,780
...that it's more difficult to keep someone alive rather than killing them.

68
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:24,240
The Elric Brothers chose the tougher path.

69
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,240
Strange guys, aren't they?

70
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:27,870
Yeah.

71
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,540
But I'm also a bit envious.

72
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,000
What's this "Rasayana" he writes about?

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,260
It's used to describe a miraculous medicine that extends one's lifespan.

74
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,180
I wonder if he's talking about a philosopher's stone?

75
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,390
Let's see...

76
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:56,270
What is this "Aurelian" that "turns all metal to gold,
and transforms old men to adolescents"?

77
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,020
It's a word for gold.

78
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,690
Most of this talks about immortality and gold.

79
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:07,410
Could it be because Mr. Scar's brother was heavily influenced by Eastern Alchemy from Xing?

80
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,070
Meaning?

81
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:14,000
In my country, we refer to the immortal as a "True Being".

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,170
It literally means "Perfect Being",
but because gold is a perfect metal,

83
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:22,250
there are times we refer to
a "True Being" as a "Golden Being".

84
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,510
I see. So a perfect being is a golden being.

85
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:33,890
Some say we refer to them that way because
the person who introduced alchemy to Xing...

86
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:39,770
...was an immortal man with golden hair and eyes.

87
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,150
Wow...

88
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,990
Golden hair and eyes? Sounds like Ed and Al!

89
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,450
Hey guys, come here!

90
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,240
I found the exit!

91
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,290
The sun's so bright!

92
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,960
Looks like we were able to get through the mountain.

93
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,750
The weather looks nice.

94
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,380
Let's head to Briggs now while we can.

95
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,800
Okay, everyone. Follow me-

96
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,970
Looks like the snow is pretty deep.

97
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,470
Help me!

98
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,930
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

99
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,970
You can ride on my back, little girl.

100
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,390
Help me!

101
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,850
We'll make a path through the snow, so you can follow us.

102
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,350
You guys listening?!

103
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,810
Hey! Hey! Hey!

104
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,310
Help me!

105
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,310
We appreciate it.

106
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,660
Hey!

107
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,790
Hey! Help me!!!

108
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,290
Is someone there?!

109
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,210
Al?!

110
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,290
Sir Alphonse?!

111
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,830
Oh no, oh no, oh no!

112
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,290
Are you okay, Al?!

113
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,710
You saved me...

114
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,220
I got stuck in a deep spot and ended up getting buried by the snow.

115
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,890
But why are you here, Al?

116
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,600
I crossed the mountain to get here before you guys.

117
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,770
You crossed the mountain... in that blizzard?

118
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,940
I get it. Instead of making a detour here, you took a straight path.

119
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,440
But why make such a reckless trip?

120
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,320
I have urgent news.

121
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,820
"Urgent news"?

122
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,950
The Central Army has infiltrated Briggs.

123
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,660
Apparently, Major General Armstrong has been summoned to Central, as well.

124
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,040
So it's dangerous to go there now.

125
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,300
What should we do?

126
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,590
We can't go back, either.

127
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:33,090
You're going to have to find somewhere else to hide out.

128
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,140
Yeah, like where?

129
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,020
Follow me.

130
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,980
Where are we going?

131
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,480
There should be a village by the name of Asbec not too far from here.

132
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:53,360
I've heard rumors my fellow countrymen have taken refuge in the slums there.

133
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,700
An Ishbalan slum, huh?

134
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,080
Doesn't seem like we have much of a choice.

135
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,500
Master, you rock! Let's get going!

136
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,210
But is it going to be okay?

137
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,250
What is?

138
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,050
Won't Sir Kimblee get suspicious if you disappear all of a sudden?

139
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,970
Nothing to worry about. Brother will keep everything under control.

140
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,060
Three from the third squadron.

141
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,060
Five from the fourth squadron.

142
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,100
Looks like we're all here.

143
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,650
Now, I want you all to begin searching in the districts you've been assigned.

144
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,110
Yes, sir.

145
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,020
Roger.

146
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,450
Let's move.

147
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,740
Aye, sir.

148
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,820
Come on, Alphonse.

149
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,870
Isn't this where you say "Okay"?

150
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,370
But it's really hard to move in this, Edward.

151
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,420
That's where I need you to do your best.

152
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,130
Come on, Kimblee's watching.

153
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,010
Wait up, Brother!

154
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,300
Walk faster.

155
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,020
Hey. Where are Kimblee and company searching?

156
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,810
There's a huge mine shaft at the center of the town, right?

157
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,820
Apparently, they're going to enter that and search the mine.

158
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:18,070
He said he's only going to take the men he brought from Central because he doesn't trust the soldiers up here.

159
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,990
He must have noticed already.

160
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,450
We're going to stall them.

161
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,460
Secure a position for sniping near the shaft mine.

162
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:26,960
Roger.

163
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,640
Search the entrance to the mine.

164
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,350
If you find multiple footprints, there's no doubt.

165
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:42,890
Yes, sir.

166
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:48,770
Can you do it?

167
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,810
At this distance, yes.

168
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,280
What's wrong?

169
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,320
Edward is...

170
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,030
What?

171
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:10,500
Kimblee, shouldn't you leave it to the soldiers from Briggs to search the mines?

172
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,000
I heard it's a labyrinth down there.

173
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,970
Seeing as how you went through the effort to persuade me out of it, this must be the place.

174
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,430
What are you talking about?

175
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,890
I just want to capture Scar-

176
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,600
Or are you trying to buy time to position the sniper?

177
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,600
So you noticed?

178
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,650
There's so much thirst for blood in the atmosphere; it would be odd not  to notice.

179
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,900
I didn't survive Ishbal for nothing.

180
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,740
It looks like they're talking about something. What should I do, sir?

181
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,330
Can you try to adjust your aim on Kimblee?

182
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,160
Yes.

183
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,450
Do it. Be very careful.

184
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,290
Aye, sir.

185
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,510
That bastard hid himself in snow!

186
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,890
Dammit!

187
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,220
Kimblee!

188
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,390
Damn you...

189
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:29,000
So you two are chimeras, too, huh?

190
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:06,200
Shit... I can't see a thing.

191
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,660
Well, they can't see me either...

192
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,990
...so I guess we're even-

193
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:14,710
Quit resisting, Fullmetal Alchemist!

194
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:20,130
There's no way for you to run since we can track you by scent!

195
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,970
Shut up!

196
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:31,730
Fullmetal!

197
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,890
What's going on?!

198
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,360
Where are you?! Respond!

199
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,110
Is that you, Major Miles?!

200
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,690
There are chimeras here!

201
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:43,570
And they've been trained to fight in places with low visibility!

202
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,320
Stay out of the smoke!

203
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,460
Oww...

204
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,380
Dammit... that just made me shorter...

205
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,800
Dynamite?

206
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,050
We're in a mine, all right!

207
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,430
Don't get too close now!

208
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,270
You do know what these are, right?

209
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,560
Are you stupid?

210
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,610
Those are probably too damp to use.

211
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,150
Do you two know what dynamite is made of?

212
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,860
Nitroglycerine?

213
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,370
Nitroglycol, chips of wood, and...

214
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,450
...ammonium nitrate, maybe?

215
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:36,750
Then what's ammonium nitrate made of?

216
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,380
Easy! Nitric acid and ammonia-

217
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,210
Ammonia?!

218
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,510
The smell!!!

219
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,390
What's that smell?!

220
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,940
Ammonia.

221
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,860
I guess there's a downside to having too keen a sense of smell.

222
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,400
These guys are toast.

223
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:09,700
So this is how you're going to act as soon as your hostages are released?

224
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,990
Don't know what you're talking about.

225
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:16,410
I'm just here to beat all the information you know out of you.

226
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,670
Christ, you're so hot-blooded.

227
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,050
Fighting with a young man like yourself during
my convalescence would surely break my bones.

228
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,630
And I don't have time to play with you either.

229
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,800
I guess I'll be using this, then.

230
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,720
He just saved me the trouble of searching for it!

231
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,140
He's fast!

232
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:49,820
Too slow!

233
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,080
He lost his philosopher's stone,
and his transmutation circle is no longer useable!

234
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,250
I-

235
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,330
"I win!"

236
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,290
Is that what you're thinking?

237
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,210
The determination not to kill.

238
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,630
An admirable policy.

239
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,800
But that's just asking for your enemy to take advantage of you during battle.

240
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:16,850
You should have killed me at that moment.

241
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:23,610
That softness is the cause of your defeat.

242
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,020
Did I fall down the mine shaft?

243
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,860
He's so heartless... he even got us into it...

244
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,450
Oww...

245
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,820
Dammit...

246
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,950
Where did Kimblee go...

247
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,670
You've got to be kidding me...

248
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,710
Hey!

249
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,270
Al! What's wrong?!

250
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,070
Sir Alphonse?!

251
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:52,860
Al?!

252
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,570
This isn't good.

253
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,780
I'm being drawn again...

254
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,370
What do you mean, "being drawn"?

255
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,580
Hey, what's wrong?

256
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,580
Al?

257
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,710
My soul...

258
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,630
...is being drawn toward...

259
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,630
Al!

260
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,460
Al?!

261
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,590
His soul is being drawn?

262
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,590
Sir Alphonse?!

263
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:18,260
Has this happened before?

264
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:17,760
Sir Alphonse! Pull yourself together!

265
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,300
I don't know!

266
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,010
PLACEHOLDER

267
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,890
Sir Alphonse!

268
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:20,890
Al?

269
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,470
Wake up, Al!

270
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:24,810
No...

271
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,520
Al!

272
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:26,980
Al!!!

273
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,060
What...

274
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,110
What should I do?!

275
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,610
Ed!

276
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:48,790
I can't... let her cry over something stupid like this...

277
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,350
Damn that Kimblee...

278
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,820
Yo, Fullmetal.

279
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,940
You alive?

280
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,700
Why did you save us?

281
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,870
You're hurt far worse than us.

282
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,620
Don't... get the wrong idea...

283
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,580
I... need someone to pull...

284
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,880
...this thing out... of my abdomen.

285
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,050
You're asking us to pull that steel frame out of you?

286
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,720
We're technically enemies, you know.

287
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,840
Yeah... please.

288
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:47,770
Well, we weren't ordered to kill you or anything.

289
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:49,890
Let's see.

290
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:54,690
But if we pull that out,
you're going to bleed out in an instant.

291
00:18:55,150 --> 00:19:01,780
As soon as it leaves my body... I'm going to seal the wound... before I bleed to death.

292
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,200
Are you experienced in medical alchemy at all?

293
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:13,420
I've attempted human transmutation in the past... so I studied the main points.

294
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:17,880
"The main points"? I'm pretty sure your organs are shredded to pieces...

295
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,050
If you don't have a philosopher's stone like Sir Kimblee does...

296
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:26,510
That's why I'm going to use my life instead of a philosopher's stone...

297
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,520
What?!

298
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,270
It may shorten my life span by a bit, though...

299
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,230
Is that okay?

300
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:36,150
I don't have the time to dawdle.

301
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:42,530
If this injury was caused by my softness... then I have to clean up after myself.

302
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:48,370
I don't really get it, but you don't have much time to waste.

303
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,290
I'm pulling it out.

304
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,590
Do it, please.

305
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:03,800
I need to think of my life as a form of energy...

306
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,930
The same as... a philosopher's stone!

307
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,060
That's right!

308
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:21,070
Right now, I'm nothing more than
a philosopher's stone made out of one soul!

309
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:30,120
Think back, and try to remember that feeling!

310
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,790
That feeling...

311
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,750
...of using...

312
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:38,460
...life!!!

313
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,190
Is he dead?

314
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,030
Don't just write me off like that...

315
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,280
Oh, it worked?!

316
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,160
It's not completely healed.

317
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:16,370
It's just a temporary measure of linking the undamaged tissues... to stop the bleeding.

318
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,000
Then we need to get you to a doctor!

319
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,920
No, I don't have time... for that...

320
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,550
H-Hey!

321
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,720
I need to go after Kimblee...

322
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:30,430
...else... everyone will be in danger...

323
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,680
Geez...

324
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,980
Idiot.

325
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,770
There's no way he can win against him in this state.

326
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,900
What is it?

327
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,280
Whoa...

328
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,280
A philosopher's stone, huh?

329
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,320
The one Sir Kimblee had with him, right?

330
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,330
You don't need to refer to that freak as "Sir".

331
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:55,620
He dragged us into this.

332
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,250
You're right.

333
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,830
I guess that's the last time we see that bastard.

334
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,000
Yeah.

335
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,380
People will think we died here, so we're free.

336
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,840
And what should we do about him?

337
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,720
We can't just let him die.

338
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,020
He saved our lives.

339
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,560
Well said.

340
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:20,230
We need to find a doctor right away
once we get out of here.

341
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,270
Yeah.

342
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:45,210
The promise we never made

343
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:45,210
Kawashita hazu no nai yakasoku ga

344
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,010
yet again

345
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,010
Kyou mo

346
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:50,840
tries to snatch our future away from us.

347
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:50,840
Bokura no mirai wo ubaou to suru

348
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:56,430
Why is it that we can't rejoice

349
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:56,430
Hoshigatteita mono wo te ni shitemo

350
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,430
straight from the heart

351
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,430
Sunao ni

352
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:02,400
when we obtain something we've always been after?

353
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:02,400
Umaku waraenai nowa nazedarou

354
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:08,110
The overflowing tears aren't from feebleness or remorse.

355
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:08,110
Afureru namida wo yowasa ya koukai ja nai

356
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,910
They're fragments born from agony.

357
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,910
Itami ga unda kakera de

358
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,950
Of all the moments and destinies,

359
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,950
Donna shunkan datte unmei datte

360
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:26,710
I realized there's one absolute certainty.

361
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:26,710
Hitotsu dake tashika na mono ga aru to shitta

362
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:29,260
Even if things get tough and I'm at my limit

363
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:29,260
Genkai datte konnan datte

364
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,260
I refuse to give up.

365
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,260
Akirametakunaiyo

366
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:38,140
Please, don't let go.

367
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:38,140
Konomama hanasanaide

368
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:45,980
I can feel the warmth of your right hand

369
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:45,980
Kataku nigirishimeta kimi no migite no nukumori

370
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,650
where it's tightly joined with my left.

371
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,650
Koko ni arukara

372
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:04,170
After breaking the stalemate,
unforeseen ideas and actions open new paths.

373
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:09,380
The one to find the hidden truth obtains the key to victory.

374
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:13,880
But that's all a part of the accumulating daily life.

375
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,180
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

376
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,200
Signs of a
Counteroffensive

377
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,200
Episode 42, Signs of a Counteroffensive.

378
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,860
The beginning of war.
