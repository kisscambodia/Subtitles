1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,440
Could you tell me what room
Colonel Roy Mustang is staying in?

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,190
Let's see...

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,450
May I have your name, please?

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,110
The name's Nox. Doctor in private practice.

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,370
He'll know right away.

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,390
Final Episode

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,390
Journey's End

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,370
Hey, princess.

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,790
It's been a while.

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,050
Who might that be?

11
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,260
I need him here for a reason.

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,760
He's what I'd call my trump card.

13
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,520
So, is he down in the dumps?

14
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,770
The main method of cultivation in the Ishbal area is double-cropping,

15
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,650
Bzzzt, try again.

16
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,780
They raise the same crop semiannually.

17
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,990
You expect to gain their trust like this?

18
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:57,990
I know!

19
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,240
Moving on.

20
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,910
So what crop do they raise with that method?

21
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,500
Barley and cotton.

22
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,580
Correct.

23
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,120
So you DO know your stuff.

24
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,670
Don't underestimate me.

25
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,340
I've been doing some research for a while.

26
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:15,260
He's planning to solve the Ishbalan crisis before becoming the Führer President.

27
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,090
"Solving"?

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,600
But first things first, "becoming the Führer President"?

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,850
Is that you, Dr. Nox?

30
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,810
Yo.

31
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,360
Looks like... you're doing okay.

32
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,570
Yeah.

33
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,690
These guys won't leave me alone.

34
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,030
No breaks, no nothing.

35
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,990
Not exactly what I meant.

36
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,570
Aren't your eyes...

37
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:38,820
Yeah.

38
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,580
Apparently, it's the punishment Truth gave to someone who dreamt of the future.

39
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,330
Are you okay?

40
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,710
Not sure about that.

41
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,340
Either way, I can't stop here.

42
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,670
Führer President...

43
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,090
Well, to take care of Ishbal first.

44
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,100
The Ishbal Annihilation...

45
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,100
That was what started everything.

46
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:10,020
Yup. Both for you, and for me.

47
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,860
I'm going to set things right.

48
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,860
Meaning?

49
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,860
First, I'm going to open up the areas in Ishbal that are currently off-limits.

50
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,820
Then, I'm going to allow the Ishbalans living in each slums back to their Holy Land.

51
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,120
There's much more to be done.

52
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,500
We were able to overcome the crisis
thanks to Scar and the other people of Ishbal.

53
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,290
We're in their debt, after all.

54
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,050
Colonel, I brought the data you asked for.

55
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,550
It's not as if our sins will be forgiven,
but we want to start with what we can.

56
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,180
Christ, you lot...

57
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,890
Yo, it looks like they took the words out of our mouths, Dr. Marcoh.

58
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,020
Marcoh?

59
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,350
Dr. Marcoh?!

60
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,650
Colonel Mustang.

61
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,660
I've got a philosopher's stone right here.

62
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,290
We should be able to get your vision back with this.

63
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,160
You're right.

64
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,670
I made this stone in the past by using the lives of Ishbalans.

65
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:27,560
I have no right to say this, but if it's for the sake of reviving Ishbal, I'm sure they'll...

66
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:36,230
No, I cannot hear their voices.

67
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,860
So this is a request from myself.

68
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,700
I want to patch you up with this stone for the sake of Ishbal.

69
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,200
They might get angry.

70
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,750
Fullmetal, too.

71
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,710
But I'll gladly take your offer.

72
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,680
And with that, I'll give it my all.

73
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,890
But before that...

74
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,640
...there's someone who needs the power of the stone more than I.

75
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,020
I can come after him.

76
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,240
Havoc General Store, happily serving for 80 years now!

77
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,700
Oh, Breda. What's up?

78
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,870
What?! You want me to head down to Central NOW?!

79
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,920
What do you mean, "you'll find out when you get there"?

80
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,840
How are your wounds treating you, Scar?

81
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,430
Why did you save me?

82
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,930
Initially to find out more about Eastern Alchemy,

83
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,390
but the situation has changed.

84
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,600
Mustang wants Miles for his new Ishbal policy.

85
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,560
And so, I decided to take you along.

86
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,280
Not as "Scar," but as someone of the Ishbalan race.

87
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,240
What do you say?

88
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,870
Won't you help us in reviving the Ishbalan religion?

89
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,950
We cannot let a religion and a culture so rich in history die out.

90
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,960
The death of a culture equates to the death of its people.

91
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,960
Save the people from death with your hands.

92
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,340
The meaning of being kept alive...

93
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:31,010
So you want me to live for a bit longer to find what that is, huh, Brother?

94
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,430
Fine.

95
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,730
I'll help you out.

96
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,980
Take me wherever you please.

97
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,150
Okay, Miles. I'm leaving the rest to you.

98
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,860
Do things safely.

99
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,610
Roger.

100
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,860
That Mustang...

101
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,450
He'd probably be frightened to death
if he were to find out that Scar is alive.

102
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,080
Scar.

103
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,870
What is your true name?

104
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,630
I've died twice.

105
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,260
I don't exist in this world.

106
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,850
Thus, I don't need a name.

107
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,010
Call me whatever you please.

108
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,640
I see.

109
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,770
We'll meet again, Ishbalan.

110
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,410
You okay?

111
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,040
I didn't imagine that my muscles would be this weak.

112
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,040
Want a ride on my back?

113
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,800
Nah.

114
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,550
I want to walk with my own two legs.

115
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,970
I'll take it slow, so you go on ahead.

116
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,970
Nah. We left the house together.

117
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,310
We have to go back together, too.

118
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,690
Well then, let's go.

119
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,190
Yeah.

120
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,740
Brother, your leg...

121
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:19,040
Yeah... I haven't had maintenance on it in forever.

122
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,630
Thanks.

123
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,500
For what?

124
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,420
Nothing.

125
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,710
What the heck?

126
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,260
Weirdo.

127
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,800
Oh yeah, I wonder if Lin and the others have arrived in Xing already.

128
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:41,190
It's been two months since then, so I'm sure they have.

129
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,270
I hope May is okay...

130
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,690
Don't worry.

131
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,280
Just leave everything to him.

132
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,580
May...

133
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,370
Sir Al...

134
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,250
What's the matter?

135
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,750
Nothing.

136
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,580
Hey you, the princess from the Chan clan.

137
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,840
Lin Yao!

138
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,300
Whoa, don't give me that scary look.

139
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,050
You're such a klutz.

140
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:21,230
In the end, you were unable to obtain a philosopher's stone because you were meddling in another country's affairs.

141
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,440
The Yao clan will now be in control.

142
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,820
But don't fret.

143
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,280
Our clan will protect yours.

144
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,080
I'm the man who even accepted the Homunculus Greed.

145
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:48,130
I'll accept the Chan clan along with all of the other clans.

146
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,180
Just look at you.

147
00:08:55,510 --> 00:09:00,060
Don't worry. People from Xing always keep promises, right?

148
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:04,180
You'll "accept us all"? That's so greedy, Lin Yao!

149
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,610
Shoot, maybe he rubbed off on me.

150
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,860
Well, then... guess we should start heading back.

151
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,160
Already?

152
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,160
Yeah.

153
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,870
I want to give Fu a proper burial.

154
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,870
Later.

155
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,960
Yup, later.

156
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,470
So many things happened...

157
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,840
Yeah.

158
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,260
By the way, Alphonse.

159
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,430
Seems like the princess of Xing,
May Chan, really took a liking to you.

160
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,440
Yeah, she's such a nice girl.

161
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,320
Moving right along, what about things between you and Winry?

162
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,760
Den! It's me!

163
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,060
Customers...?

164
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,440
Den, that tickles!

165
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,620
Welcome home, idiots!

166
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,080
Yo!

167
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,000
Good to be home!

168
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,880
Oww!!

169
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,760
2 Years Later

170
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,390
I suck at stuff like this...

171
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,850
Nothing, huh...

172
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,120
Ah, well.

173
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,540
Brother, you still haven't fixed it yet?

174
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,290
I'm all worn out from greeting people.

175
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,000
Winry knows that, but she's treating me like her slave.

176
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,460
On top of that-

177
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:05,300
She wants you to come down for tea
now that her apple pie is out of the oven.

178
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,640
Okay.

179
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,390
We have a pretty amazing view today!

180
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,390
Yeah.

181
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,690
The world is so vast.

182
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,060
Yup.

183
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,530
Brother, there's something that's been on my mind for a while.

184
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,030
I'm probably thinking of the same thing.

185
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,790
How is your work?

186
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,710
There are so many things to worry about; I feel like I suddenly aged twenty years.

187
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:48,430
But I have Mustang and Armstrong fulfilling their duties in the east and the north, respectively.

188
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:52,680
Thanks to them, an old geezer like me can somehow manage to perform my duties as the Führer President.

189
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,310
I really owe them a lot.

190
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,060
Are you not going to give away your position?

191
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:03,480
I can't hand it over to the young ones just yet.

192
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,940
Oh, my.

193
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,410
You sound just like my late husband.

194
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,200
He was always totally committed to work, like you are.

195
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,750
Oh no, I'm the most...

196
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,960
...irresponsible person I know.

197
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,170
Oh my, Selim.

198
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,300
What's the matter?

199
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,090
This little birdy is hurt.

200
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,140
Could you help him?

201
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,810
Oh, no.

202
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,690
Have the butler call a veterinarian.

203
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,520
Will... Will he get better?

204
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,110
Of course he will.

205
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,980
Run along now.

206
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,950
He's grown into such a kind boy.

207
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,410
He has.

208
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:56,450
Everyone protested when I decided I'd raise him,

209
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,540
but he's grown so much without giving me reason to worry.

210
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,460
We're going to be keeping an eye on him for just a little while longer.

211
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,680
You're aware what we'll have to do...

212
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,560
...if he causes trouble, right?

213
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,810
I won't let him.

214
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,320
A homunculus and a human.

215
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:34,830
Will they really be able to understand each other?

216
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:41,500
New possibilities get you excited no matter how old you are.

217
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:50,380
Is Edward not depressed about his left leg?

218
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,050
Not at all.

219
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:57,100
He even said, "As punishment, I'd rather keep my leg as an automail."

220
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,100
I see.

221
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:02,850
He also said, "Winry'll cry if I don't have this."

222
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,110
What in the world?

223
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,400
I'm so glad you two got your bodies back.

224
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,240
I'm sure Maes will be happy too.

225
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,120
Starting with Mr. Hughes,

226
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:29,670
So many different people from so many different places helped us be happy.

227
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:34,050
And that's why I feel like it's our turn to give back.

228
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,300
Is that what you alchemists call "Equivalent Exchange"?

229
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,180
Nope. If we received 10 and gave 10 back,
everything would be the same.

230
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:47,310
If we receive 10, we add an extra and give back 11.

231
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:51,780
It's very minor, but it's a new rule my brother and I came up with.

232
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,700
But now we're going to have to live up to our word.

233
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,200
There's something you want to do, isn't there?

234
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,710
There's a girl we couldn't save.

235
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:10,710
We still can't forget about her.

236
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,510
Welcome!

237
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,510
Mr. Jerso, Mr. Zampano.

238
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,260
Yo.

239
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,930
We've got a ton of food. Eat up.

240
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:20,890
Okay.

241
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:24,310
Excuse me! Can I get a glass of milk and a sandwich?

242
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,140
Coming right up!

243
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,150
I see. So you've already paid your respects.

244
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,480
Yup.

245
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,070
Then it's...

246
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,650
...time.

247
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,410
I'm going to Xing.

248
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:42,950
I plan on studying Eastern Alchemy full-scale at May's place.

249
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,410
Not just Xing.

250
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:49,040
I want to go around all the eastern countries to study various things.

251
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,920
I want to see and learn many things.

252
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,760
I also want to meet many new people.

253
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,930
But wait, are you two really coming along?

254
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,760
Of course!

255
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,430
Our wild instincts tell us...

256
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:06,560
...that coming along with you...

257
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,730
...will get us something great!!

258
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,820
Alphonse.

259
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:18,780
We're going to look for a way to return to our old bodies.

260
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,450
You're the one who told us not to give up.

261
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:24,290
We have to do things ourselves
instead of having others do the work.

262
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,790
Right!

263
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,130
Isn't your brother coming to Xing?

264
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,250
Nah.

265
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:35,420
I'm taking the eastern route,
and he's taking the western route.

266
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,050
And once the two of us gather the knowledge we gained from both directions,

267
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:42,760
we may be able to avoid the same kind of tragedy that happened to Nina.

268
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,430
But, you know...

269
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,940
That's not the only reason why we're traveling.

270
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,440
We want to see just how vast the world is!

271
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,610
You need to oil it every day.

272
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,610
Sure.

273
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,820
And check to make sure all the screws are tight.

274
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,030
Sure.

275
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,370
Dry it off after coming out of the shower.

276
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,200
Sure...

277
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,460
Hey, are you even listening?!

278
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,870
Sure...

279
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,670
Geez...

280
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,670
Well, here it is!

281
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:26,430
With this attitude, you're just going to end up
breaking it and having to come back again soon.

282
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,310
Yeah, yeah, I know.

283
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:33,690
When you need maintenance,
be sure to call in for an appointment.

284
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,940
Sure.

285
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,320
Appointment...

286
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,700
What?

287
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,210
Winry...

288
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,630
What is it? Just speak up if you've got something to say.

289
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,390
It's equivalent exchange!

290
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:10,600
I'll give you half of my life, so you give me half of yours!

291
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,570
Oh, geez!

292
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:25,200
Why do alchemists have to be like this?

293
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,160
"Equivalent Exchange"? Are you retarded?

294
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,490
What did you say?!

295
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,370
You really are stupid.

296
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,670
Half? I'll give you all of it.

297
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,970
W-Wait, maybe not all of it!

298
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:45,890
90 percent...

299
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,890
Or maybe.. 80 percent?

300
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:49,600
A bit more than 70...

301
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,640
Okay then, 85 percent?

302
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,980
Sure! I can give you that much!

303
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,270
W-What?!

304
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,770
Ed!

305
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,230
My bad, my bad.

306
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,780
Ed!!

307
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,700
You really are amazing.

308
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,790
You're able to overturn the law of equivalent exchange so easily.

309
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,910
What do you mean by that?

310
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,290
Are you making fun of me?

311
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,460
I'm not.

312
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:22,340
That cheered me up. Thanks.

313
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,260
I'll be off now.

314
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,180
Safe trip!

315
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:49,200
Oh my, even Edward left on a trip?

316
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,450
Why don't they settle down a little?

317
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,700
For them, this is fine.

318
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,170
Men who keep still are no fun.

319
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,960
A lesson without pain is meaningless.

320
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,930
That's because no one can gain without sacrificing something.

321
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:16,850
But by enduring that pain and overcoming it...

322
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,190
...he shall obtain a powerful, unmatched heart.

323
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,360
A fullmetal heart.

324
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,620
Drawn by a landscape as white as snow,

325
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,620
Masshiro na keshiki ni ima sasowarete

326
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:39,170
I'm headed toward an unseen world.

327
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:39,170
Boku wa yuku yo mada minu sekai e

328
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:48,110
I've been traveling while lost

329
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:48,110
Maigo no mama tabi shiteita

330
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,900
Under this gray sky.

331
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,890
Nezumiiro no sora no shita

332
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:56,990
Every day with new maps, stained with my many dreams.

333
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:56,990
Higawari no chizu ikutsumo no yume ga nijindeita

334
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,380
I wonder if someday,

335
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,380
Itsuka wa sa

336
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,420
Chippoke na boku no kono hohaba demo

337
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,420
Even with these tiny steps of mine,

338
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:09,500
I'll be able to travel beyond those clouds.

339
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:09,500
Ano kumo no mukou made yukeru kana

340
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,130
I put on a bold front.

341
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,130
Tsuyogatte

342
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,680
End up hurting myself.

343
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,680
Kizutsuita

344
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:15,760
I feel empty inside.

345
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:15,760
Kokoro sukashita youni

346
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,300
It's started to rain,

347
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,300
Furidashita

348
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,470
Amatsubu tachi ga

349
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,470
And the raindrops

350
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:22,690
Began to repeat their scattered reflections.

351
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:22,690
Ranhansha kurikaesu

352
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:25,560
These straight rays of light

353
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:25,560
Massugu na hikari ga

354
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,280
Start to cross one another.

355
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,280
Kousa shite

356
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:31,860
And without telling anyone where they're headed,

357
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:31,860
Yakusaki mo tsugenumama

358
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,150
Across the endless distances,

359
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,150
Doko made mo

360
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,740
They pass through all matter.

361
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,740
Tsukinukeru

362
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:40,570
I burn these faint afterimages onto my eyes.

363
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:40,570
Awai zanzou ryoume ni yakitsukete

364
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,490
Under this sky,

365
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,490
Kono sora no shita

366
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:46,320
Wherever I am,

367
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:46,320
Donna toko ni itemo

368
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,620
I should be able to reach

369
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,620
Todoku hazu nanda

370
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:53,430
The unseen world.

371
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:53,430
Mada minu sekai e
