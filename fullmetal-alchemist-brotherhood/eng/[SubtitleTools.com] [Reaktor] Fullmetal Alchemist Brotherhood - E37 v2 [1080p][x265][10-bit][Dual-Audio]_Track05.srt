1
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,870
Can't focus. My body is still puzzled about what to do.

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,870
Shuuchuu dekitenaina mada karada ga mayotteirunda

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,630
I'm trembling. I can't stop even if I try to control myself.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,630
Furueteitanja kontoroorushitatte burerunda

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,380
Although neither sun nor moon are on my side,

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,380
Taiyou mo tsuki mo nanmo kanzen ni kocchi muiteinaiga

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,800
"I've no choice but to try,"

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,800
Yarushikanainda

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,470
Those were the words I muttered to myself.

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,470
Iikikaseruyouni sotto tsubuyaita

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,060
The odds aren't on my side, but running way'd be gutless.

12
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,060
Joukyou wa waruiga tada nigedasunja konjou nainaa

13
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,060
Even if I can't see the future, I'll just have to win it over with courage.

14
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,060
Tenbou wa naiga dokyou de kuria suru shika naiya

15
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,560
Need to keep distance from the target as I hold myself back.

16
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,560
Shoudou wa osaetamama taagetto to no kankaku sagure

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,860
All that's needed for victory is pride to win.

18
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,860
Hitsuyou na mon wa katsu puraido

19
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,950
Will we celebrate with the wine of victory

20
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,950
Ajiwau nowa shouri no bishu ka

21
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,950
Or'll we end up kissing their feet in defeat?

22
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,950
Soretomo haiboku no kujuu ka

23
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,700
There are two outcomes to everything.

24
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,700
Sou subete wa futatsu ni hitotsu

25
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,420
Ayatsuritai unmei no ito

26
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,420
I want to control destiny.

27
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,750
I need to seize the golden opportunity with my hands.

28
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,750
Zekkou no goorudentaimu kono te de tsukame

29
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,840
I'll finish it up with my best poker face,

30
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,840
Konshin no pookaafeisu kimete shikakeruyo

31
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,800
And drag them into a world of illusions.

32
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,800
Iryuujon no sekai e hikizurikonde

33
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,140
I'll find my way out of this endless pressure game,

34
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,140
Saigennai puresshaageemu sururito nukete

35
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,150
And leap over the borderline of honor.

36
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,150
Eikou no boodaarain tobikoeru tameni

37
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,860
How many? What'll I need to sacrifice to make it happen?

38
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,860
Haumenii? Dorekurai no daishou ga iru?

39
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,120
What is the one thing I don't want to let go?

40
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,120
Tebanashitakunai mon wa dore?

41
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,980
Who in the world are those guys?

42
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:46,780
They're Kimblee's men, dispatched from the Central Army. Supposedly "bodyguards" for the Rockbell girl.

43
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,410
What the hell are you planning to do at Briggs, Kimblee?

44
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,270
The First Homunculus

45
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,000
You should have told me if you were coming north.

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,090
I didn't have time. I was in a rush.

47
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,300
You guys are always  in a rush!

48
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,850
Why were you locked up, anyway?

49
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,600
It was just a misunderstanding.

50
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,930
They'll be set free soon enough.

51
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,890
I'll go through the formalities later.

52
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,350
Thank you, Mr. Kimblee.

53
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,820
Please look after these blockheads for me.

54
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,530
Of course.

55
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,450
Hey. Don't trust Kimblee too much.

56
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,950
Why? He's a nice man.

57
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,670
Ms. Rockbell.

58
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:43,460
Your parents were the doctors who lost their lives at Ishbal, were they not?

59
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:45,920
Yes.

60
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,930
As I thought.

61
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,310
It was my unit who recovered their bodies.

62
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:57,690
We were a second too late.
When we arrived at the scene, they were already...

63
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,690
I see...

64
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,200
They obeyed the ethics of medicine and
stuck to their convictions until the very end.

65
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,110
I admire them from the bottom of my heart.

66
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,580
I wish I could have met them while they were still with us.

67
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,710
They kept a picture that was taken with an adorable little girl.

68
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,590
Your existence must have been what drove them onwards.

69
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:33,060
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Miss Winry Rockbell.

70
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,230
Hey! Do you know what he did at Ishbal?!

71
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,360
I've only heard the true stories about Ishbal from the Lieutenant.

72
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,660
From the Lieutenant...

73
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,540
You're in love with Winry, aren't you?

74
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,180
Calm down!

75
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,720
Just... Just think about something else, Ed!

76
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,680
Hydrogen, helium, lithium, beryllium...

77
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,140
...carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur...

78
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,730
E-Ed?

79
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,350
...aluminum, silicon, phosphorus, chromium, manganese, iron...

80
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,730
...cobalt, nickel...

81
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,230
Why did I fall for a weirdo like him?

82
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,400
Did you say something?

83
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,860
N-Nothing!

84
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,410
Oww!

85
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,330
D-Damn you, I told you to let me know before you join the nerves!

86
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,330
Yeah, whatever. Now for your leg.

87
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,260
It's so light!

88
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,220
Doesn't its durability suffer if you make it so light?

89
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:56,470
If you look at the big picture, it's less durable than it used to be, but the key points have been reinforced.

90
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,350
Why are you out of your cell?

91
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,940
Dunno.

92
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,150
I guess you can think of it as
my capability as a State Alchemist.

93
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,450
You finally switched to a northern type?

94
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,860
Looks like you've got some changes, too.

95
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,780
This suits me the best!

96
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,750
Light-weight combat automail, M-1910!

97
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,090
What?! The tip of your nails are reinforced!

98
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,300
Don't tell me it's made out of diamond?!

99
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:35,090
That's right. It's a Neo M-1910, Mad Bear G!

100
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,310
Hey! Want me to equip you with something like this, Ed?!

101
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,600
No thanks!

102
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,850
So who is this pretty gal?

103
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,810
She's my mechanic.

104
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,330
What the hell was that for?!

105
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,240
It kind of pissed me off.

106
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,660
What an ass...

107
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,670
That's the first time I've actually seen a northern automail!

108
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,420
I'm so happy!

109
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,250
Really?

110
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,590
Then do you want to look around my workplace?

111
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,260
Yes! Yes, I'd love to!

112
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,340
Hey!

113
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,420
What?

114
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,420
W-Well...

115
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,760
Don't get too carried away and walk around all over the place.

116
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,520
It's kind of dangerous around here. In a lot of ways.

117
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,640
Gotcha. I won't. Thanks for the warning.

118
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,270
Thanks for allowing me to look around!

119
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,770
This one right here is pretty rare.

120
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,990
Wow! This is amazing! Isn't this a Crocodile?!

121
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,150
She's so spirited about her work, just like how her parents were.

122
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,490
Yeah, that's right.

123
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,820
The thing really setting this apart from others is...

124
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,080
...it was designed with the material's expansion rate in mind.

125
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,540
Well, since your limbs are good to go...

126
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,790
...let's get down to business...

127
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,790
...Mr. Fullmetal Alchemist.

128
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,800
So...

129
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,010
...why can't I  be let out?

130
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,050
Mr. Kimblee's orders.

131
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,270
We've been told to only release the Fullmetal Alchemist for now.

132
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,390
Kimblee's men...

133
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,150
They thought this through, not letting us work together.

134
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:17,030
They've also taken the effort to bring Winry here to show us that she's in their hands.

135
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,530
I guess that shows how cautious they are about us.

136
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,370
I can't rush this. I have to wait for the right chance.

137
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,290
The advance unit only brought enough food for three days.

138
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's already been a week since they left.

139
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,170
They could be on the verge of starvation.

140
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,300
I'm also worried about their sanity.

141
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,930
Being in complete darkness for an entire week is...

142
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,800
Let us put our trust in their minds.

143
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:48,310
General, there's no knowing what could happen down there.

144
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,440
If we don't return in twenty-four hours, please seal this entrance.

145
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,440
Understood.

146
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,040
Since you're all here, I have something to tell you.

147
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,710
The murder of Lieutenant General Raven was my decision and act, alone.

148
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:13,210
You all didn't see or hear anything.

149
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,960
If word gets out, blame everything on me.

150
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,220
Aye, ma'am.

151
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:36,820
Let's get moving.

152
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:49,330
I see. Looks like things are starting to get hectic up north.

153
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:53,080
Yeah. We're going to have to start taking the initiative from now on.

154
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,590
Briggs is staffed with men well-versed in defense.

155
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,340
Only one who excels in both offense and defense can snatch a victory by making the first move.

156
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:06,890
Which is why Madam Olivier believes that working with the
Eastern Army, well-versed in offensive tactics, is the best option.

157
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,980
It's an honor to be selected as a partner for her tag team.

158
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,100
I think you have it wrong.

159
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,570
She said she just wants the power of the Eastern Army, and she'd rather you take a hike.

160
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,190
Oh, okay...

161
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:28,290
Let me ask you this, though. What if I sold this information to the Führer President for my own gain?

162
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:32,870
"Impossible. Mustang wouldn't do that," so she says.

163
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,630
That'll be 35,000 cenz.

164
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,250
It's an honor.

165
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,090
Madam, who are you exactly?

166
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,390
Just a florist who's worked with the Armstrongs for generations.

167
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:05,030
Hughes, it seems the people who truly understand and support you are the ones who fought beside you in a war.

168
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,530
Now...

169
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,580
What to do with these flowers...

170
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:09,530
What in the world?

171
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,580
What a weirdo.

172
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,040
Oh, god! He's looking this way!

173
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,830
This is horrible...

174
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,460
It's the same as Smith's arm.

175
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,920
Even metal has been cut up.

176
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,510
Stay on your toes. The enemy may still be around.

177
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,520
There's someone there!

178
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,070
Don't worry.

179
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,490
Look, it's me.

180
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,070
L-Lieutenant Henshel?

181
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,080
Thank god you're alive.

182
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,370
Is it just the two of you?

183
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,080
What about the others?

184
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,870
E-Everyone else is in... p-pieces!

185
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:00,090
We... We have to get out of here quickly!

186
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,380
That thing will come back!

187
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,170
"That thing"?

188
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,550
D-Don't turn on the lights!

189
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,800
The shadow... The shadow will come back!

190
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:07,800
Calm down!

191
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,430
Hey!

192
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,970
Hey! Get a hold of yourself!

193
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:14,930
The shadow!

194
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,020
Can you stand?

195
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,690
Let's go.

196
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,980
Carry as many men as you can.

197
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,740
I apologize for visiting so late at night.

198
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,240
I've come to deliver an urgent document to the Führer President.

199
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,370
Oh, my. I'm sorry.

200
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,420
He's not at home right now.

201
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,710
I'd like him to look through these by tomorrow.

202
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:45,590
By tomorrow, right? I'll let him know.

203
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,260
Thank you very mu-

204
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,050
You were still awake, Selim?

205
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:56,680
Yes. I heard the door open,
so I thought Father might have returned.

206
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,560
This is Lieutenant Hawkeye.

207
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,150
Good evening, Miss Hawkeye.

208
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,690
It's a pleasure to meet you.

209
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,110
Do you always work such late hours?

210
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:09,150
That's right. I've come to deliver a document to your father.

211
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:13,030
I apologize for waking you.

212
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:19,790
Now, Selim. You must sleep now, or you'll have a difficult time waking up tomorrow.

213
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,460
Okay.

214
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,000
He seems like a bright boy.

215
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,760
Yes, we're very proud of him.

216
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,470
You could call me an indulgent mother if he were my real child, but since he's an orphan, I can boast all I want.

217
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:42,190
Well, he's distantly related to my husband, so it could be his blood that made him so wonderful.

218
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,320
He's not related to you?

219
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,230
No.

220
00:12:53,410 --> 00:13:00,710
According to the Colonel, King Bradley was raised as a test subject since he was an infant and has no blood relatives.

221
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,170
He shouldn't have any distant relatives.

222
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,090
And that feeling I sensed earlier...

223
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,460
Just who is that boy?

224
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,210
Oops, did you notice?

225
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,550
Oh, that mother of mine...

226
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,100
She just loves to talk.

227
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,520
I sensed a hint of bloodlust earlier.

228
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,600
I've felt the same sensation before...

229
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,610
And I just remembered where it was from.

230
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:30,110
It's the same sensation I felt when a Homunculus by the name of Gluttony snuck up on me.

231
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,110
Selim Bradley...

232
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,870
Just what are you?

233
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:42,500
You have quite the nerve to ask me that in this situation, Lieutenant Hawkeye.

234
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:47,420
It's also smart of you not to pull out your gun, which you're so skilled with.

235
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,300
You can't defeat me.

236
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,220
Are you also a Homunculus, like Gluttony?

237
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,560
No, I sense a power that can hardly be compared to that of Gluttony's.

238
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,520
I'd be offended if you put me on the same level as him.

239
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:11,610
My name is Pride. The First Homunculus.

240
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:24,000
The First Homunculus, you say?

241
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,120
What do you mean by that?

242
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,580
Exactly as the words mean.

243
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,550
So you're planning on gathering as much information as you can, huh?

244
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,630
You're really a brave one.

245
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:38,260
What do you say you join us?

246
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,720
Join you?

247
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,810
You just want another pawn, don't you?

248
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,600
I see. That's a shame.

249
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:45,810
In that case...

250
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,240
Will you cut the empty threats already?

251
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,660
There's no benefit in killing a hostage, is there?

252
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,740
I'm amazed you saw through it.

253
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,250
However, Lieutenant Hawkeye...

254
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:11,340
I'll always be watching you from your shadows.

255
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,020
Work?

256
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,520
Yes, as a State Alchemist.

257
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:32,440
You have three tasks from the Führer President.

258
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,950
Your first task is to search for Scar. All you have to do is find him.

259
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,240
I'll take care of him after that.

260
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:45,290
Your second task is to look for Doctor Marcoh, who is presumed to be escaping alongside Scar.

261
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,460
Doctor Marcoh is with Scar?

262
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,330
Just like with your previous task,
after you find him, I'll take care of the rest.

263
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:54,960
Then, your third task is to carve a bloody crest into Briggs.

264
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,630
Carve a bloody crest?

265
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,800
It's the same as Ishbal.

266
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,680
Slaughtering humans and carving a symbol of hatred and sorrow into the land.

267
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,430
There's no way I could...

268
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:18,900
You became a dog of the military without the resolve to kill?

269
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,610
With the resolve not  to kill.

270
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,530
With a resolve not to kill...

271
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:28,250
That can also be true, if you stick with it.

272
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:33,170
Are you lending them a hand,
knowing what those guys are up to?

273
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,170
They're-

274
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,250
I want to see how the world will change.

275
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,760
Resolve pitted against resolve.

276
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,010
Will clashing against will.

277
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,340
Life against life.

278
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,220
And humans against the Homunculi.

279
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:47,390
Who will win? Which will the world choose as the victor?

280
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:55,480
If humans are defeated by Homunculi, those who claim to be an evolved form of them, it's truly a historical moment.

281
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,610
I just want to live to see that happen.

282
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,070
Why are you, a human, working with the Homunculi?

283
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:07,410
Because they'll let me use my alchemy as I please.

284
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,200
You're insane.

285
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,460
I know that I'm not normal.

286
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:18,800
But if someone like me survives this,
then it means the world's selected me.

287
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,210
The survivors...

288
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:23,220
It's a battle for existence.

289
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,180
How worthwhile.

290
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,180
I can't understand you.

291
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,850
Oh, what a shame.

292
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:39,480
I always thought all alchemists were selfish.

293
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,070
Let me try appealing to your selfish side.

294
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,790
Here's something you want more than anything in the world.

295
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,790
If you accept the job, it's yours.

296
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,540
A philosopher's stone!

297
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,550
Let me talk it over with Al and Winry.

298
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,600
With Miss Winry, too?

299
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,310
I haven't told her anything.

300
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:15,310
Whatever job I may have to do,
I don't want to lie to her and betray her.

301
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,940
Very well.

302
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,820
I'll be monitoring you, so you don't tell her anything she doesn't need to know.

303
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,120
Winry.

304
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,830
You're currently being kept as a hostage.

305
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,960
What? What do you mean?

306
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,590
Is this a joke?

307
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,210
Listen up.

308
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,340
I've been instructed by the higher-ups to do my duty as a human weapon.

309
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,760
So I may have to be party to mass murder.

310
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,600
What?!

311
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,770
But can't you just refuse...

312
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,690
Oh, so that's why I'm...

313
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:05,190
No... I'm being a burden to you two.

314
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,700
I won't cry!

315
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,450
I'm sorry.

316
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,450
I'm just mad at myself for being so happy-go-lucky.

317
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,460
Why is this...

318
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,500
You two just want to get your bodies back...

319
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,460
About that...

320
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:25,340
They'll give us a philosopher's stone if I help them.

321
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,760
What? A stone?

322
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,590
But...

323
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,970
Kimblee has one.

324
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,350
Yeah, but those stones are made of...

325
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,470
I know that!

326
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,820
Do whatever you want, geez...

327
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,440
That's the plan.

328
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,370
I've decided to take the job.

329
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,870
Let me look for Scar first.

330
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,620
Oh? Why is that?

331
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,290
Scar killed Winry's parents.

332
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,300
I want to avenge them.

333
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,010
I see. Fair enough.

334
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,300
And I'll be taking Al with me.

335
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,890
Since he's in that state, Scar can't use his destruction techniques on him.

336
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:17,140
Oh, how convenient.

337
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,890
Is it really okay, Al?

338
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,900
A philosopher's stone is made by sacrificing the lives of many people.

339
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,410
Don't worry.

340
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,660
Brother isn't planning to use it at all.

341
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,460
We're thinking that there may be a way to get
our bodies back by using Eastern Alchemy from Xing.

342
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,800
And a little girl who can use
Eastern Alchemy is supposedly with Scar.

343
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,880
So he's making it look like he's going after Scar, but his plan is to get in touch with that girl?

344
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,010
That's my guess.

345
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:54,970
I see.

346
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,440
Then I'd better think up a good reason, too.

347
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,690
Huh?

348
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:17,790
We're going to head to the location Scar was last sighted.

349
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,290
Sounds good.

350
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,330
Okay, scoot in!

351
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,750
Al, scoot over some more!

352
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,630
Hey, what the heck?!

353
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:36,800
Ms. Winry, please wait at the fortress.

354
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,600
This isn't a game.

355
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,970
I know that!

356
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,440
But I just fixed up his automail, right?

357
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,770
It would be bad if it stopped working all of a sudden, so I should go along in case maintenance is needed.

358
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,780
If something were to happen, it would hurt the proud name of the Rockbells!

359
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:56,320
You're really into your work, aren't you?

360
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,490
You workaholic.

361
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,120
Of course I'm into it!

362
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,540
We've been in business since my great-grandfather's generation!

363
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,540
Okay. Very well.

364
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,790
I know that!

365
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,620
I'll allow it.

366
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,170
You're from a family of machine freaks.

367
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,630
I don't care if you call me a machine freak!

368
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,720
There's no knowing what will happen.

369
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,390
I know.

370
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,440
But I'm sick of sitting and waiting for something to happen.

371
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:37,790
Even if we part and meet again, I want to meet at this place.

372
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:37,790
Megurimeguttemo mata koko de aitai

373
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:44,720
Then we'll hold hands to ensure we'll never be separated again.

374
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:44,720
Hagurenaiyouni kono te wo tsunagunda

375
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,350
Asahi ga noboru made katariattane

376
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,350
We used to talk all night until the sun rose,

377
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:50,180
And held hands till the sun went under the horizon.

378
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:50,180
Yuuhi ga shizumu made tsunaida te

379
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:55,430
Let's walk together like this forever, like light and shadow.

380
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:55,430
Kouyatte asu mo asatte mo tomo ni ayumou hikari to kage

381
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,980
I stand in the city, staring off into space with lonely eyes.

382
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,980
Samishige ni mitsumeru machi no naka de

383
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:05,320
I can't find warmth on my own.

384
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:05,320
Nukumori wa hitori ja mitsukaranakute

385
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:10,830
By meeting you, I realized

386
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:10,830
Ai ga konnani tsuyosa ni narukoto

387
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:16,660
How much strength love could give me.

388
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:16,660
Shittanda kimi ni deaete hajimete

389
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:21,920
Even if we part and meet again, I want to meet at this place.

390
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:21,920
Megurimeguttemo mata koko de aitai

391
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:27,220
Then we'll hold hands to ensure we'll never be separated again.

392
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:27,220
Hagurenaiyouni kono te wo tsunagunda

393
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:32,430
I can't sleep by myself, 'cause I can't dream without you.

394
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:32,430
Hitori ja nemurenai yume wa mirenaikara

395
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:38,190
So take me to a place where uncertainty can't reach us

396
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:38,190
Donna fuan mo todokanai tokoro e

397
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:43,440
And let us bring light to the night sky with no stars.

398
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:43,440
Hoshi no yoru mo terashitsuzukeyou

399
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,940
So long as you're with me, I can go to world's end.

400
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,940
Doko made mo yukeru kimi to nara

401
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,950
Hitori ja arukenai michi mo futari nara

402
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,950
Even if it's a path I can't walk on my own,

403
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:51,990
If you're by my side, I can walk it while humming a tune.

404
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:51,990
Hanauta utainagara arukerunda

405
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:55,410
If we're together, the world is mine.

406
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:55,410
Kimi ga ireba shiawase

407
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:05,060
An all-out war between chimeras and humans takes place in a mining town where the piercing wind blows.

408
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,690
Don't let down your guard. Give it your best.

409
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:13,110
What is the strange aftermath brought forth by the fierce battle?

410
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:18,200
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

411
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,210
Conflict at Baschool

412
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,200
Episode 38, Conflict at Baschool.

413
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,080
Humans let down their guard in their moments of victory.
