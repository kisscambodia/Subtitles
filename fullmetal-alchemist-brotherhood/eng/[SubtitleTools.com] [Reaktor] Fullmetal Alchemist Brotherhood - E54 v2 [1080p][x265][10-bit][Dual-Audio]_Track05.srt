1
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,270
1909 - End of the Ishbalan Civil War

2
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,070
Are you not going back?

3
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:15,860
They're going to leave you behind.

4
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,530
A grave of a comrade?

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,320
No, an Ishbalan child.

6
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,370
The body was left abandoned on the side of the road.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Let's go back.

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,170
The war is over.

9
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:40,170
Inside my heart, the battle in Ishbal is still not over.

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,720
No, I'm sure it never will be.

11
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:51,890
I'm the one who believed in you and entrusted you with my father's research.

12
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:59,190
I'm also the one who chose to enter a military academy, wishing for the well-being of the people.

13
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,530
Even if that brought an outcome that I didn't wish for,

14
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,370
I can't escape from the truth.

15
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,660
I can't compensate for it.

16
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,460
I have a favor to ask of you, Sir Mustang.

17
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,220
Please burn the skin off of my back.

18
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,720
How could I do such a-

19
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,640
At the very least!

20
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,520
If I can't compensate for it, then at the very least,

21
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,770
I'd like to destroy this secret to flame alchemy on my back,

22
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,980
in order to ensure that the world will never see another Flame Alchemist.

23
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,820
Could you please do that for me?

24
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,740
Please set me free.

25
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,410
Please set me free from what my father burdened me with...

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,290
From alchemy.

27
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,670
Please release me from this.

28
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,050
Please.

29
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,390
I understand.

30
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,060
I'll burn it off your back with the least amount of scarring possible.

31
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,700
Thank you, Sir Mustang.

32
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:33,750
Yatto mitsuketa atarashii asa wa

33
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:33,750
The new morning we've finally found

34
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,790
is being hampered by the past.

35
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,790
Tsukihi ga jama wo suru

36
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:43,260
What we chased after wasn't the future,

37
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:43,260
Mukau saki wa tsugi ja nakute

38
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,090
but the past so full of remorse.

39
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,090
Sugi bakari oikaketa

40
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:53,560
The ruthless memories won't stop playing;

41
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:53,560
Nariyamanai yousha nai omoide tachi wa

42
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,650
they won't be forgiving us for a long time.

43
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,650
Yurushite kuresou nimonai

44
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:03,490
Sorosoro kana tesaguri tsukareta hoho wo

45
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:03,490
It's about now that a teardrop

46
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:08,160
beings to roll down my fatigued cheeks.

47
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:08,160
Kattou ga koboreochiru

48
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:13,410
Will this rain ever stop?

49
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:13,410
Ame wa itsuka yamunodeshouka

50
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,630
I've been freezing for a long time.

51
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,630
Zuibun nagai aida tsumetai

52
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:23,920
Why does the rain continue to fix on me?

53
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:23,920
Ame wa doushite boku wo erabuno

54
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,680
I wonder if it could embrace me.

55
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,680
Tsutsumarete iikana

56
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,470
Today, the rain falls again;

57
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,470
Ame wa yamu koto wo shirazuni

58
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:38,690
endlessly it falls knowing no end.

59
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:38,690
Kyou mo furitsuzukukeredo

60
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:43,730
We nestle close to each other to share the warmth

61
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:43,730
Sotto sashidashita kasa no naka de

62
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:55,450
under this umbrella, you gently held out to me.

63
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:55,450
Nukumori ni yorisoinagara

64
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,610
Beyond the Inferno

65
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,010
What's this about, Lieutenant?

66
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,430
Who do you think you're pointing a gun at?

67
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,850
Who?

68
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,270
Don't make me laugh.

69
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:26,690
The Colonel always calls me 'Riza' when we're alone together.

70
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:27,820
Dammit!

71
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,150
So you guys have something going on?!

72
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,030
Just kidding.

73
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,450
Thanks for falling for it, Envy.

74
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,710
I'm going to need you to die here.

75
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,380
That hurts, you bitch!

76
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,020
Damn you...!

77
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,310
You shoot too much!

78
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,440
I'll turn you into a rag and show you to the Colonel-

79
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,740
Colonel?!

80
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,140
What do you think you're doing to my irreplaceable subordinate?

81
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,770
Don't be so reckless, Lieutenant.

82
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,940
I thought I told you I'd take care of him myself.

83
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,250
How dare a lowly human like you look down on-

84
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,750
Dammit...!

85
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,170
This again-

86
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,010
So this is your true form.

87
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,510
You look disgusting.

88
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:05,310
So your name 'Envy' comes from 'jealousy'.

89
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,900
Now I get it.

90
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,730
No...!

91
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,900
Stop...!

92
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:16,360
Jealousy sure is disgusting.

93
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,490
No! I don't want to die!

94
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,080
N-No!

95
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,200
Get out...

96
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,540
PLACEHOLDER

97
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,540
Nooo!!!

98
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,660
...of my sight!

99
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,670
What's this about, Lieutenant?

100
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,290
That's enough, Colonel.

101
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,880
I'll take care of the rest.

102
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,510
One more blow will do the trick.

103
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,140
Lower your gun.

104
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,970
I cannot consent.

105
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,470
Please put your hand down.

106
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,810
Stop joking!

107
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:45,680
I'm ordering you to lower your gun!

108
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,190
Fullmetal.

109
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,070
Hand him over.

110
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,030
I'll say it once more.

111
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,580
Hand him over.

112
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,580
I refuse.

113
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:25,100
He deserves the worst death possible.

114
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,470
I refuse.

115
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,060
Hand him over!

116
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,060
If not, I'll set your right arm ablaze along with him!

117
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,440
Well said!

118
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,020
I'll fight you head-on!

119
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,230
But before we get to that, take a good look in the mirror!

120
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,490
Do you plan on standing at the top of this country with a face like that?!

121
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,200
That's...

122
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,160
That's not what you've been working your ass off for, is it?!

123
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,210
A subordinate protects their subordinate, and so forth.

124
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:57,630
That should be possible, even for us puny humans.

125
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,170
Sounds interesting.

126
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,260
I'm in.

127
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,810
I want to see what kind of changes
your naive ideals will bring to this country.

128
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,600
So you're going to let your emotions take over
and descend to the path of a savage.

129
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,480
I guess that's fine.

130
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,020
If you're going to insist on living for revenge, I won't stop you.

131
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,570
Hey!

132
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,700
I don't have the right to interfere with someone's revenge.

133
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:32,040
I'm just interested to see what kind of world will be created by someone held prisoner by hatred.

134
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,210
I won't let you kill Envy, Colonel.

135
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:41,260
But still, I don't plan on letting Envy live either.

136
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,840
I'll take care of him.

137
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,970
I...

138
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,640
I finally tracked him down!

139
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,850
I know that!

140
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,220
But...

141
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:56,560
But what you're about to do isn't for the sake of the country, and it's not for the sake of helping your comrades either.

142
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,110
You're trying to dispel your hatred.

143
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,740
That intent alone is gnawing at your heart.

144
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,320
You can't fall down that path.

145
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,270
Shoot me if you want.

146
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:44,110
But what will you do after you kill me?

147
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,450
I don't plan on living free and easy.

148
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,080
After this battle is over,

149
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:59,670
I plan on taking flame alchemy, an art that brings about madness, to the grave along with my body.

150
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,510
That won't do.

151
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,390
I...

152
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,100
...can't lose you.

153
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,440
What's with this situation, I wonder.

154
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,570
Being scolded by a child,

155
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,910
and being cautioned by a man who had been after my life for revenge.

156
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,410
I made you go through something dreadful again.

157
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,540
I'm the biggest idiot in the world.

158
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,640
I'm sorry.

159
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,070
Are you guys retarded?

160
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,690
Now you're just sugarcoating your words?

161
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,490
Are you playing a game of "let's be humane"?

162
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,240
You're making my skin crawl.

163
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:14,120
Are you humans really that extravagant?

164
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:17,830
Just do what your instincts tell you!

165
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,670
You haven't forgotten, have you, Colonel Mustang?

166
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:23,750
Scar's been after your life!

167
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,170
If I recall...

168
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:30,840
...it was also Scar who killed the runt's friend's parents too, right?

169
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:35,510
Oh yeah, and the chimera made from the girl and the dog from East City!

170
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:39,480
Wasn't it also Scar who killed them?

171
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,650
And on the other hand, you, Scar!

172
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:46,860
What happened to that hatred you had,
due to so many of your brethren being killed in Ishbal?!

173
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,990
That woman over there got all puffed up from being called the "Hawk's Eye",

174
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,870
and shot to death many of your friends!

175
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,080
This is the greatest chance for all of you!

176
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,540
Come on, just do it!

177
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,450
The cast is assembled!

178
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,330
Hate, cry, kill, be killed, and writhe in agony!

179
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,840
Get down on all fours!

180
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:10,970
There's no way you pieces of shit can just hold hands and be jolly!

181
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,260
Come on, puny runt.

182
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,930
Come on, Hawkeye.

183
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,300
Mustang!

184
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,680
Scar!

185
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,980
W-Why?

186
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,320
Hey, why?

187
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,780
Hey. Hey! Hey!

188
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,160
Why is this happening?!

189
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,740
W-Why?!

190
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,000
Why the hell?!

191
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,120
Envy.

192
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,500
You're... jealous of humans.

193
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:55,090
Humans are supposed to be a lot weaker than you homunculi,

194
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,520
but even if they get discouraged after being beaten, and even if they get close to falling down after losing their path,

195
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,350
they continue to get up and fight.

196
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:05,150
Everyone around them helps them get on their feet.

197
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:11,190
And you're envious of those humans.

198
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:14,110
By sacrificing something minor,
you'd be able to save something major.

199
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,240
It's a simple concept if you just think about it.

200
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,870
Humans can't shoot me if I do this, right?

201
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:24,410
Well, that's what makes you all human.

202
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:29,750
But if I'm going to transform, wouldn't it be better to turn into someone young and pretty?

203
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,380
Humans are so foolish.

204
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,680
They risk their lives for something so futile.

205
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,800
They're human, after all.

206
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,510
Humans...

207
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,850
Humans...

208
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,900
Hey! Stop trying to get away!

209
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,610
Whoa, hang on!

210
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,780
Idiot! If you force yourself out...!

211
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,280
Ow!

212
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,490
Hold it.

213
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,870
He doesn't have much longer.

214
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,250
This is a disgrace.

215
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,210
Being turned into a rag like this...

216
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,170
Being beaten up by you humans...

217
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:17,970
Beaten by an existence on the same level as shit...

218
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,970
And to make matters worse,

219
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:29,100
a brat like you who's shitty even by a human's standards...

220
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,710
Dammit!

221
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,000
Dammit...!

222
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,090
Dammit!

223
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,090
This is a disgrace!

224
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,470
A disgrace!

225
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:01,930
I, Envy, am jealous of humans?

226
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,430
I, Envy?!

227
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:12,150
It's the greatest disgrace...

228
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,740
...to be understood by a brat like you.

229
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:30,040
I don't know how much longer you can get away with sugarcoating your words,

230
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,090
but do try your best.

231
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,240
Good-bye...

232
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,820
...Edward Elric.

233
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,340
So he took his own life.

234
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,170
What a coward.

235
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,400
His wounds are healing!

236
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,410
Monster!

237
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,120
Hey, what the hell is that?!

238
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,500
Good timing! Lend us a hand!

239
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,910
What do you mean?

240
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,670
We were ordered to shoot Major General Armstrong!

241
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,170
What?! Major General!

242
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,460
Even the Major?!

243
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,760
Yes, good timing.

244
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,260
From here on out, I'm in charge of this squadron!

245
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,260
No questions asked, just lend us a hand for now!

246
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
Whoa, what the hell are those?!

247
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:18,190
Everyone, duck!

248
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,780
Bullets do nothing against them.

249
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,160
Destroy their upper jaws!

250
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,910
At the very least, they won't be able to bite you to death.

251
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,040
Team up with a partner and take down at least one of them.

252
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,000
Show me the courage of the soldiers at Central!

253
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,460
Y-Yes, ma'am!

254
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,170
Umm...

255
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,220
What am I supposed to be doing again?

256
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,100
Oh, I remember now.

257
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,350
I need to kill the female general.

258
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,400
I won't let you!

259
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,950
You're in the way.

260
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,910
Only being able to use one arm is a bit...!

261
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,920
Major!

262
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,840
General!

263
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,130
He's going to get beaten to death!

264
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,010
Someone needs to go help him!

265
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,220
Leave him be!

266
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:33,220
There's no way a beating like that could bring my younger brother down, considering the way he trains!

267
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,400
This is...

268
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,310
...the end.

269
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,820
Major!

270
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,000
My shoulder joint is back in!

271
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,880
That's it!

272
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,210
A collaboration of artistic muscles and artistic alchemy.

273
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,920
Both excellent and elegant!

274
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,720
Yes.

275
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,060
The Armstrong Mansion is completely empty.

276
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,730
Dammit, so they were building tanks in here?!

277
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,910
This is the battlements of the main gate!

278
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:14,910
Give me the mission headquarters!

279
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,790
We're under attack by tanks that are presumably from Briggs!

280
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,700
Mission headquarters!

281
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,710
Don't shout at me!

282
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:21,670
I can see that for myself!

283
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It doesn't matter! Fire back!

284
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,290
But the civilians have yet to evacuate!

285
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:29,130
The main gate will be down if we were to wait for something like that!

286
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:29,800
Headquarters!

287
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,920
Contact the main gate artillery squadron-

288
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,930
Dammit, what's going on?!

289
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,140
You're going to open fire on the urban area?

290
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,980
I'm going to have you repeat that on the radio too.

291
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,150
You scum...!

292
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,570
That equipment is from Briggs!

293
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,490
How did you get in here?!

294
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:57,030
Well, there's a man with a good memory who used to work at Central Headquarters,

295
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,870
and happened to remember this location with pinpoint accuracy.

296
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,120
There was also a person who dug an underground path between here and the urban area,

297
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:06,250
all by herself.

298
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,630
There's no one in this world who could do such a thing!

299
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,960
Oh, but there is.

300
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,510
W-Who?!

301
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,510
If someone were to ask me who I am, I would tell them I'm a housewife.

302
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,220
That's what I usually do, but...

303
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:23,350
I guess today, I'll tell you my other occupation.

304
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,190
An alchemist!

305
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,040
Ever since that day passed,

306
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,040
Ano hi kara zutto

307
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,380
I promised myself that I'd never cry.

308
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,380
Nakanaito kimetekitakedo

309
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:51,880
But even while I hoarded up the pain,

310
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:51,880
Itami wo kasanetemo

311
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:57,010
there was something I couldn't forgive myself for.

312
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:57,010
Nanika wo yurusezu ni ita

313
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,560
I'll never be able

314
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,560
Mou modorenai

315
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,100
to return to those days.

316
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,100
Ikutsumo no hibi

317
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,810
You're alone?

318
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,940
I'm still powerless.

319
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,940
Boku wa mada nanimo dekizuni

320
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:09,400
I figured you'd bring your sons.

321
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:13,240
I watch as the shards of memories disappear, one by one;

322
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:13,240
Kimi no ita kioku no kakera

323
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,780
It doesn't take very many people to scold a brat who committed a blunder, does it?

324
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:19,200
memories of when you were still with me.

325
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:19,200
Mata hitotsu kieteyuku

326
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:17,320
The Dwarf in the Flask,

327
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,320
Homunculus.

328
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,290
I long to become

329
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,290
Kyou yori motto

330
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,580
Tsuyoku naritai

331
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,580
stronger than I am now,

332
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:29,630
Slave Number 23, the man who gave me a part of his body.

333
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:29,960
so that my voice will eventually reach you.

334
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:29,960
Kono koe ga itsuka todokuyouni

335
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,380
If the wind happens to stop

336
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,380
Arukitsuzukete

337
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,130
This time, you'll become a part of my body.

338
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,880
in the midst of my long journey,

339
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,880
Kaze ga yandara

340
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,100
I'll look up at the sky in search of you.

341
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,100
Kimi wo sagashite sora miageruyo

342
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:47,350
Beyond the daybreak, a ray of light breaks free.

343
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:47,350
Yoake no saki ni hikari ga sasuyo

344
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:52,980
A rainbow spans across the sky.

345
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:52,980
Niji ga kakaruyo

346
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:03,830
Humans, think about what you must do now.

347
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:07,290
Think about to whom you must prove yourself to,

348
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:10,500
and why this is.

349
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:16,050
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

350
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:20,580
Episode 55, The Adults' Way of Life.

351
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,580
The Adults' Way of Life

352
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:25,310
Walk forward proudly with your head held high.
