1
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:23,460
We sigh whenever we're about to come to a standstill

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:23,460
Owarinaki tabi no tochuu tachidomarisouna toki

3
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,710
While moving on this endless journey.

4
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,710
Fukai tameiki kobosu bokura wa

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,430
Everytime we lunge for it, it escapes and flies off.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,430
Tsukamikaketewa mata hanareteitta

7
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,850
But now, there's nothing to be afraid of

8
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,850
Demo ima wa mou nanimo osoreru koto wa nai

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,780
The powerful ties that bind our hearts

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,780
Kokoro wo tsunagu tsuyoi kizuna wa

11
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,240
Will never come loose.

12
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,240
Keshite hodoke wa shinai sa

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,960
After a lifetime of searching, we finally arrived

14
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,960
Sagashitsuzukete tadoritsuita

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,760
Here, where the period lies.

16
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,760
Kono basho de piriodo ni

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:23,060
Let's change all our sorrow and rage to power.

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:23,060
Kanashimi ikari chikara ni kaete

19
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,980
Destiny is right within our reach.

20
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,980
Unmei wa sugu soba ni

21
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:52,130
It's that expression again, May.

22
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,300
Yeah, that also represents gold.

23
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,720
What are you two doing?

24
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,640
We're checking to see whether there's a hidden message here.

25
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,220
A hidden message?

26
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:11,560
Alchemists often hide their research using trope and hidden meanings to prevent ordinary people from deciphering it.

27
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,320
But at a glance, these documents aren't encrypted.

28
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:23,330
So we're going to note that phrases with "immortality" and "gold" appear quite often to try to view things differently.

29
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,620
Think you're on to something then?

30
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,080
Not at all.

31
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,330
Where am I?

32
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,130
Al!

33
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:32,880
Sir Al!

34
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,170
I'm so glad!

35
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,590
I was worried you'd never wake up!

36
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,880
Sorry for worrying all of you.

37
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,010
So, why am I in pieces?

38
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,640
And that's where we're at now.

39
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,020
You were too large to carry.

40
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,020
That is why we had to take you apart.

41
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,530
Sorry to give you guys so much trouble.

42
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,910
Has this ever happened before?

43
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,160
Just once, while I was on my way here.

44
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,870
It must be inconvenient for you to be scattered in pieces.

45
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,170
Let's put you back together.

46
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,300
Thanks, I appreciate it.

47
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,630
Could you hold on to this for a second?

48
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,260
Let's see...

49
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,350
This is...

50
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,560
I think that's his right arm.

51
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,560
Ah, you're right. We have to put him back together properly.

52
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,310
Scattered in pieces...

53
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,030
Putting things together...

54
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,250
Hey, May?!

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,420
Look at what you've done!

56
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,960
They're all scattered now!

57
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,880
I was wondering...

58
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:09,180
...how it would look if we changed the pages' order by grouping terms such as "gold" and "immortality".

59
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:19,690
"Golden Being"... I saw that term over there.

60
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,860
"Immortality"... overlaps with these right here.

61
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,610
"Perfect Being"...

62
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,950
Ah, I found it!

63
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,490
Hand me those pages, Marcoh.

64
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,500
Oh, that ties into these!

65
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,000
Does anyone have a "Golden Being"?

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,710
I do. It's right here.

67
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,550
That should be the last of them.

68
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,720
Could it be...

69
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,810
This is...

70
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,990
The Nationwide Transmutation Circle...

71
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,030
Even if we find out about this now...

72
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,700
What does this mean?

73
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,330
Do you mean these research documents won't be of any use at all?!

74
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,450
You've gotta be kidding me!

75
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,290
What's going to happen to us-

76
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:15,960
No...

77
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,580
What's going to happen to this country?!

78
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,000
I apologize...

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,840
I was foolish to hope someone else's studies would overturn this crisis.

80
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,520
Brother, is this what you wanted to tell me?

81
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:40,400
Knowing you, shouldn't you have gotten further than this?

82
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,650
There's still something else.

83
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,030
We didn't even realize to take it apart at first.

84
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:52,530
It wouldn't be strange if there was more hidden in these documents!

85
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,830
Yeah.

86
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,720
Idiot! What were you thinking?!

87
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,010
It's Mother Nature's fault for making it so cold.

88
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,300
Besides, I'm sensitive to the cold!

89
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,100
So what?!

90
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,680
Now we don't know front from back!

91
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,400
Look at all these you flipped over!

92
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,480
That may be it!

93
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:27,360
We need to "overturn" this crisis!

94
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,660
Flip each one of them over from how they were originally!

95
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,710
Well?

96
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,920
Bingo.

97
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:52,430
This is a new Amestrian Nationwide Transmutation Circle that is activated when Eastern Alchemy is made a part of it.

98
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,200
Signs of a
Counteroffensive

99
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,660
I don't see any signs of them going this way.

100
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,870
Perhaps I took a wrong turn somewhere. I guess I'll go back.

101
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,200
I see.

102
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:59,830
So this place is used to remove the rubble from the tunnel Sloth is digging.

103
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,500
You're the Crimson Alchemist, correct?

104
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,630
Pleasure to meet you. I'm Pride.

105
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,720
Can I help you?

106
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,970
What happened with Scar?

107
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,180
I'm currently after him.

108
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,720
Save that for later.

109
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,730
First, carve a bloody crest into Briggs.

110
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:30,860
With all due respect, the soldiers at Briggs are quite monolithic and powerful.

111
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,650
It won't be that easy.

112
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,450
You need to utilize that exact strength.

113
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:44,920
The tunnel being dug by Sloth is almost complete.

114
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,630
I understand.

115
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,670
As you say, I'll carve a bloody crest.

116
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,470
To the Briggs fortress.

117
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,650
We've been waiting for you!

118
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,520
Any changes?

119
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,400
Nothing in particular.

120
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,740
Moving right on, I heard Kimblee has gone missing. Is this true?

121
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,070
Yes.

122
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,540
There was an explosion large enough to cause a shaft to collapse.

123
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,460
Kimblee and a few others are missing.

124
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,380
We searched the rubble, but in the end, found no bodies.

125
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,300
Are the "few others" soldiers from Briggs?

126
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,680
No.

127
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,640
Two of Kimblee's men...

128
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,010
...and the Fullmetal Alchemist.

129
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,310
Oh. The Fullmetal boss, eh?

130
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,570
I hope he's okay.

131
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,530
As do I.

132
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,150
How are things in the west?

133
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:02,580
Things are getting nasty on the Pendleton border.

134
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:07,120
From their way of fighting, I can't help but think they're trying  to produce more deaths.

135
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,590
As you said, it seems like the army is taking the initiative in causing bloodshed to create a transmutation circle.

136
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,590
Have you gotten word from
Master Sergeant Fuery in the south?

137
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,100
He called me a little while ago.

138
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,810
He says they're having an all-out war with the Aerugon army in South Fotsett.

139
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,700
R... Run, Thomas!

140
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,790
No time to rest!

141
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,620
Thoma-

142
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,630
Dammit!

143
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,960
I will survive!

144
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,880
God dammit, I will  survive!!

145
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,390
I see.

146
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:11,270
After all, we, members of Mustang's old team, aren't so popular.

147
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,270
Have you been in contact with the Colonel?

148
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:19,030
Yes, in full detail. We've been using a messenger who's acquainted with the Armstrong family.

149
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,410
Roger that.

150
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,910
Things seem to be getting pretty serious up north, so be careful.

151
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,990
Serious sounds about right.

152
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:35,040
The underlings of the man who's planning to turn this country into Hell are proceeding steadily with their plan,

153
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,750
but there's not a single thing we can do about it.

154
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,390
It's connected.

155
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:59,280
I don't have to work anymore... right... Pride?

156
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,490
The time is near.

157
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,990
The day is right within our reach.

158
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,600
Guys!

159
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:33,140
Lunch is served! Please line up!

160
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:41,030
Hey Rose, I'd like to have meat pie next time.

161
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,450
We'll make some if we get the ingredients.

162
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,160
I'll be looking forward to it!

163
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:53,290
I don't work here, but do you think you could possibly give these two something to eat?

164
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,670
Why not?

165
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,040
There's plenty for you, too, madam.

166
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,170
This looks so good!

167
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:05,180
Can I get an extra scoop, Rose?

168
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,300
Sorry, everyone gets the same amount.

169
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,180
Excuse me...

170
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,560
C-Can I have some, as well?

171
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,400
You saved me!

172
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,740
Thank you so much. It was great.

173
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,660
Where did you come from?

174
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,580
That's a difficult question to answer,
since I've been wandering all over the place.

175
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,620
But why Lior of all places?

176
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,250
You've heard of the riot that happened here, right?

177
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:46,380
There's nothing left in this town because of it.

178
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,510
There are delicious meals here, are there not?

179
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,350
I'm flattered by your compliment,

180
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,770
but this is about all I can do to help.

181
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,400
That's not true.

182
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:09,570
Both the warm meals you serve and the bright smile on your face motivate everyone to work.

183
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,790
That's right.

184
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:21,710
I know you just saved my life,
but I'm actually looking for a church.

185
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,630
A church?

186
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:28,630
Yeah. The headquarters of the Leto religion, the cause of the riot.

187
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,770
It's just as you see.

188
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,900
Even if you go in, there won't be anything left.

189
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,360
Is there a passage that leads underground?

190
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,700
Y-Yes, there is, but...

191
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,490
What's this?

192
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,200
A poisoned reservoir.

193
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,500
It was already like that when we found it.

194
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,510
So an ordinary human won't be able to get past this.

195
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:10,760
Let's see.

196
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,510
Wait!

197
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,720
You'll die if you step in it!

198
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,100
A miracle...

199
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:28,320
You mean... alchemy...

200
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,620
I'm going to go a bit further,
so could you wait for me here?

201
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,880
Wow...

202
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,390
This place is huge.

203
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:58,510
Damn him, making something so large.

204
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,650
That was quick.

205
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,830
Uh oh, that wasn't even enough to slow you down.

206
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,380
In that case...

207
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,010
Why don't I trap you?!

208
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,680
Uh oh...

209
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,560
This isn't good...

210
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,000
What's wrong? Aren't you going to kill me?

211
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,750
Hmm?

212
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:13,260
You... You're Van Hohenheim, aren't you?

213
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,760
Looks like this is as far as you can go.

214
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,270
You'll die if you go any further?

215
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,980
Going past this line will result in your death, right?

216
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,020
Kind of like that flask.

217
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:38,410
So, my conclusion is you can only move within this tunnel and in the center portion of Central.

218
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,700
What do you say?

219
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,080
Am I right?

220
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:50,250
What's wrong? Why don't you say something, Mr. Can't-Leave-His-Home?!

221
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,170
You mad?

222
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,640
There's no such thing as wrath within me.

223
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,890
Not just wrath.

224
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:07,690
I left all of my unnecessary emotions within Father.

225
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,520
My name is Pride.

226
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,730
Pride...

227
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,280
I see, so that stands for "avarice".

228
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,280
They say man is embodied by seven deadly sins.

229
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,160
Lust.

230
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,040
Greed.

231
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,910
Sloth.

232
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,410
Gluttony.

233
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,670
Envy.

234
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,630
Wrath.

235
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,670
And... Pride.

236
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,390
So the emotion he let go of first was you. "Pride".

237
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:49,440
Funny how he detached you to look exactly as he did when he was in the flask.

238
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:57,360
So that appearance itself is the true nature of that arrogant, self-adulating father of yours.

239
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,490
I'm going to ask that you visit my father.

240
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,280
Hey, no need to rush things.

241
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,540
Don't worry; I'd visit him even if I weren't invited.

242
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,000
Tell him this:

243
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,290
"Slave Number 23 will be coming to see you soon."

244
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:19,420
"Throw yourself back in your chair in Central while you wait for him."

245
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,300
Got it?

246
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,970
Sure, I'll be waiting for you.

247
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,470
Van Hohenheim.

248
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,950
He's back.

249
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,740
Find anything?

250
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,120
Yeah...

251
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,000
People shouldn't go near this place. It's dangerous.

252
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,540
Please tell everyone not to go in.

253
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,720
What were you doing down there?

254
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,850
Just a little declaration of war.

255
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,150
Your shift is up.

256
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:18,360
Finally! The blizzard was killing me!

257
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:22,780
I guess I'll go have a cup of bad coffee.

258
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,200
Good work.

259
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,080
H-Hey!

260
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,290
Don't tell me that's...

261
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,210
The Drakman army?!

262
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:45,430
Drakma to the north has declared open hostilities!

263
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,430
All men, battle positions!

264
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,390
I repeat!

265
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:51,060
Drakma to the north has declared open hostilities!

266
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,180
All men, battle positions!

267
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,160
We're lucky the Northern Wall of Briggs isn't around.

268
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,750
Right, Sir Kimblee?

269
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:20,710
Additionally, there are many men loyal to me in the fort.

270
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:26,260
Once the battle begins, they'll betray the others, causing the fort to be thrown into confusion.

271
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:32,520
At last, I shall take Briggs by storm.

272
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,520
The fort that has stood in the way of Drakma for eternity!

273
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,900
It's time for the declaration of war.

274
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,820
Let's launch some fireworks, shall we?!

275
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,700
All cannons at the ready!

276
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:56,580
Fire!!!

277
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:19,270
The promise we never made

278
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:19,270
Kawashita hazu no nai yakasoku ga

279
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,060
yet again

280
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,060
Kyou mo

281
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:24,900
Bokura no mirai wo ubaou to suru

282
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:24,900
tries to snatch our future away from us.

283
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:30,490
Why is it that we can't rejoice

284
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:30,490
Hoshigatteita mono wo te ni shitemo

285
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:31,490
straight from the heart

286
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:31,490
Sunao ni

287
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:36,450
when we obtain something we've always been after?

288
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:36,450
Umaku waraenai nowa nazedarou

289
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,170
The overflowing tears aren't from feebleness or remorse.

290
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,170
Afureru namida wo yowasa ya koukai ja nai

291
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,960
They're fragments born from agony.

292
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,960
Itami ga unda kakera de

293
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:52,010
Of all the moments and destinies,

294
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:52,010
Donna shunkan datte unmei datte

295
00:22:52,010 --> 00:23:00,770
I realized there's one absolute certainty.

296
00:22:52,010 --> 00:23:00,770
Hitotsu dake tashika na mono ga aru to shitta

297
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:03,310
Even if things get tough and I'm at my limit

298
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:03,310
Genkai datte konnan datte

299
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:07,320
I refuse to give up.

300
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:07,320
Akirametakunaiyo

301
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:12,200
Konomama hanasanaide

302
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:12,200
Please, don't let go.

303
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:20,040
I can feel the warmth of your right hand

304
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:20,040
Kataku nigirishimeta kimi no migite no nukumori

305
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,710
where it's tightly joined with my left.

306
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,710
Koko ni arukara

307
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,300
Yeah, that's right. My name is Zampano.

308
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:36,930
One of Kimblee's men.

309
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,190
Doctor Marcoh is currently hiding in the slums of Asbec.

310
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:44,730
I appreciate you telling us, Zampano.

311
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,820
We'll guarantee your safety.

312
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,610
Marcoh!

313
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,490
Things are getting interesting!

314
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,000
Wily souls bring about a catastrophe,

315
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,670
and the pride making the decision gets hurt in the process.

316
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,380
But it's inevitable in the process of rebirth.

317
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:15,850
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

318
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:19,870
Episode 43, Bite of the Ant.

319
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:19,870
Bite of the Ant

320
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,390
The snowfield is dyed red.

321
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:26,230
The color of blood that was shed to protect.
