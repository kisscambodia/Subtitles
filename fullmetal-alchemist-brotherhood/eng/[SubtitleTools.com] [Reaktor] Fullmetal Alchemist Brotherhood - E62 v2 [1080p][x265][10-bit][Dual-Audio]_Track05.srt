1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,150
The new morning we've finally found

2
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,150
Yatto mitsuketa atarashii asa wa

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,190
is being hampered by the past.

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,190
Tsukihi ga jama wo suru

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,660
What we chased after wasn't the future,

6
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,660
Mukau saki wa tsugi ja nakute

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,490
but the past so full of remorse.

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,490
Sugi bakari oikaketa

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,960
The ruthless memories won't stop playing;

10
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,960
Nariyamanai yousha nai omoide tachi wa

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,050
they won't be forgiving us for a long time.

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,050
Yurushite kuresou nimonai

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,890
It's about now that a teardrop

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,890
Sorosoro kana tesaguri tsukareta hoho wo

15
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,560
beings to roll down my fatigued cheeks.

16
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,560
Kattou ga koboreochiru

17
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,810
Will this rain ever stop?

18
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,810
Ame wa itsuka yamunodeshouka

19
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:52,030
I've been freezing for a long time.

20
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:52,030
Zuibun nagai aida tsumetai

21
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,320
Why does the rain continue to fix on me?

22
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,320
Ame wa doushite boku wo erabuno

23
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,080
I wonder if it could embrace me.

24
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,080
Tsutsumarete iikana

25
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,870
Today, the rain falls again;

26
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,870
Ame wa yamu koto wo shirazuni

27
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,090
endlessly it falls knowing no end.

28
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,090
Kyou mo furitsuzukukeredo

29
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,130
We nestle close to each other to share the warmth

30
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,130
Sotto sashidashita kasa no naka de

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:28,850
under this umbrella, you gently held out to me.

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:28,850
Nukumori ni yorisoinagara

33
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,320
Bastard!

34
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,180
That's as far as you're going to get.

35
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,200
A Fierce Counterattack

36
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,320
Dad!

37
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,440
He was trying to make philosopher's stones again.

38
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,700
Humans should just stay as stones.

39
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,450
Why do you treat humans like such lowly creatures?

40
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,830
Philosopher's stones can be created from humans,

41
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,540
and homunculi can be created from philosopher's stones.

42
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,300
So, answer me. What can be created from homunculi?

43
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,840
What do you give birth to?!

44
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,970
An existence that only brings about destruction can be called 'God'?

45
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,050
You may believe that you've become a perfect being,

46
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,890
but all you are is an obstacle in the cycle of life!

47
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,100
Is that so?

48
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,980
Then I shall give birth to humans.

49
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,840
I've obtained immortality....

50
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:23,930
I'm still alive...

51
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,930
King Xerxes!

52
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,200
A body!

53
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,490
This body is mine!

54
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,780
Finally, a body...

55
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,620
Stop...

56
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,490
Please, stop...

57
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,540
This... This isn't right!

58
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,790
Look! A body!

59
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,080
Hohenheim...

60
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,960
Guys...

61
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,510
You!!

62
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:10,770
Shoot!

63
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,860
What the hell is going on?!

64
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,820
Shit!

65
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,740
Greed!

66
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,490
D.K.!

67
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,240
Looks like you're okay.

68
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,200
Great timing! Give me a ride.

69
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,370
It'll probably help to have someone with you who knows what's up.

70
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,330
Yeah! What on earth is going on?!

71
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:39,000
The leader of the homunculi, "Father," is off on a rampage.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,170
Those who can't fight should get off right here!

73
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,010
Hey!

74
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,970
The frog and the two princesses!

75
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:46,800
Scram!

76
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,220
You're all injured!

77
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,100
Don't be ridiculous!

78
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,140
Who else but me will take the lead?!

79
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,600
Hell if I know!

80
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,980
Just get the hell off of there!

81
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,350
This ain't the time to be blabbering on about leading!

82
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,860
You have no right to-

83
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,650
General!

84
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,440
A call from headquarters.

85
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,700
Mission headquarters? It's me.

86
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,070
What's the status over there?

87
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,740
Ma'am, half of Central Headquarters...

88
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,750
...has been annihilated.

89
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,210
What?

90
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,290
We can't get in touch with the North Gate.

91
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,630
That's what he's capable of.

92
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,840
Just what is he...?

93
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,930
He looks like an ordinary human from the outside.

94
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:34,310
However, he has several hundred thousand human souls worth of philosopher's stones stored in his body,

95
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,810
and has absorbed God with that energy.

96
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,150
You alchemists out there should understand the severity of the situation.

97
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,320
Philosopher's stones...

98
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,070
You ordinary humans should stay behind.

99
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,120
My men are up there fighting.

100
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,830
I am their commander.

101
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,790
General, headquarters would like to speak with you.

102
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,260
What is it?

103
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,590
Don't worry, General.

104
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:13,720
Don't forget that we Briggs soldiers are capable of operating even if our boss is absent.

105
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,100
Armory, Team Yellow! Are you alive?!

106
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,350
East Gate, Team Blue! Come in!

107
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,860
We overheard that you're injured.

108
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,570
Please watch over us from there.

109
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,400
Alex!

110
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:28,860
Ma'am!

111
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,660
Bring the communications equipment!

112
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,540
Win no matter what!

113
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,790
Of course we will!

114
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,460
Right. Let's go, Lieutenant.

115
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,840
Hey! Both of you are hurt!

116
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,670
I'll burn his philosopher's stone to a crisp.

117
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,880
But in order for me to do that, I'll need the lieutenant's help.

118
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,300
Who cares, let's get a move on.

119
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,350
My duty is to protect the young master.

120
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,770
Please take care of Izumi...

121
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,650
...and everyone else.

122
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:14,160
Let's rock 'n' roll!!

123
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,270
So this is where he bit the dust.

124
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,890
Did you do this?

125
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,730
He was heavily injured by the time he got here.

126
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,400
If that hadn't been the case, I'm not sure whether I would have made it out alive.

127
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:55,780
Captain Buccaneer dealt a fatal blow to Bradley with the aid of a man from Xing...

128
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,790
So, Bradley...

129
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,790
...wouldn't you say my men were quite something?

130
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,490
Shao May, you're all right...

131
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,780
Thank goodness...

132
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,040
Sir Alphonse?!

133
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,050
May...

134
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,010
I'm glad you're alive...

135
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,300
Sir Alphonse, your body...!

136
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,560
Sir Alphonse!

137
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,400
Oh no! If you hadn't protected me...!

138
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,690
Sir Alphonse!

139
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,450
Sir Alphonse!!

140
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,050
Master!

141
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,510
Master! Master!!

142
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,720
I'm still alive...

143
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:45,560
Mr. Hohenheim protected us...

144
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,110
H-Hohenheim!

145
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,150
Hey! Hang in there!

146
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,340
Hohenheim!!

147
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,300
Two to start with.

148
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,220
Stop it!!

149
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,900
Our target is a man with long, blonde hair!

150
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,360
Don't confuse him with the Fullmetal Alchemist!

151
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,030
Roger!

152
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,280
East Gate, Team Blue! Step on it!

153
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,610
West Gate, Team White! Get in the shadows of the west building of headquarters!

154
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,660
Yes, sir!

155
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,910
Master!

156
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,290
Fire!!

157
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,350
Yo, Fullmetal! You alive?

158
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,980
Attacks like these won't even scratch him!

159
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,810
You're kidding me!

160
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,610
Don't give him a chance to counterattack!

161
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,240
Aye, sir!

162
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:35,790
Dammit! He looks like he's enjoying the breeze!

163
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,210
Roger that!

164
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,170
Put me through to each squadron.

165
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,050
Is that so?!

166
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,180
Cease fire! Duck!

167
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,080
Did I hit him?

168
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,960
Grazed him.

169
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,500
Fix your aim towards 12 o'clock.

170
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,970
I can't see, so I don't know how much I should suppress my flames.

171
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,760
Don't suppress them at all!

172
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,800
Distance 50...

173
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,140
No, 53!

174
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,730
I still can't get used to this clapping business.

175
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,690
A frontal attack!

176
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,240
Nice work!

177
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,950
Take that back. It's pretty useful.

178
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,740
Fire! Fire!

179
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,910
Keep it up!

180
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,460
Don't give him the chance to counterattack!

181
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,170
Keep making him use up his philosopher's stone!

182
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:23,990
Incredible!

183
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:28,200
I could make the world mine if I had that power!

184
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,870
Hey, Greed!

185
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:34,620
Is this what you meant by "making the world yours"?

186
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,160
That's right!

187
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,880
If I could just obtain that, the entire world would be mine!

188
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,010
This feeling of emptiness inside me might just be cured!

189
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:48,640
The thirst that's been haunting me since birth just might be quenched!

190
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,720
You're disgraceful, Greed.

191
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,270
That's not what you really want.

192
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,600
Keep your mouth shut, shitty brat!

193
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,690
I'm Greed, the avaricious!

194
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,190
I'll obtain everything I want at any cost!

195
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:08,990
Homunculus Cake, anyone?

196
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,500
Not even a scratch...

197
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,510
We need to do something about that barrier!

198
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,010
We're running out of ammo! Bring us some more!

199
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,760
Futile acts.

200
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:36,020
Mere humans can hardly lay a finger on me.

201
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:42,360
If humans can't, what about a homunculus?!

202
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,280
Great timing, Greed.

203
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,740
You're such a good son.

204
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,200
I was just in need of a philosopher's stone.

205
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,870
I'll be taking yours.

206
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,590
Just kidding.

207
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:15,310
You can't take my philosopher's stone without putting your barrier down, right?

208
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:20,810
Did you not consider the possibility that you'd have the power of God taken from you instead?

209
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,650
I'll take all of it!

210
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,870
Greed!

211
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,310
Don't give up!

212
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,490
He... blocked it himself.

213
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,000
He's at his limit!

214
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,260
He can no longer hold down God!

215
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,760
Stone...!

216
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,880
Stone!

217
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,340
Philosopher's stone!

218
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,360
Run, Edward!

219
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,860
Brother, run!

220
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,450
Brother!!

221
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,370
Stop it!

222
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,740
Dammit!!

223
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,040
Sir Al!

224
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,620
Stop...!

225
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,830
Stop it!

226
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,040
Help...

227
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,250
Help him...!

228
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,050
Help my-

229
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,440
May, I need you to do me a favor.

230
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,070
Brother got my soul back by sacrificing his right arm.

231
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,240
In that case, it should be possible to do the opposite.

232
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,740
Sir Alphonse...?

233
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,990
All I need you to do is to make a path.

234
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,000
You can do it, right?

235
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,370
But if I did that, you'd...!

236
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,920
We're running out of time!

237
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,750
Please.

238
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,380
You're the only one I can ask to do something like this.

239
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,260
Stone...

240
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,180
Human...

241
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,020
Energy...!

242
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,270
Edward!!

243
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,940
Give it to me!!

244
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,700
What are you trying to do...?

245
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,500
Cut it out...

246
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,420
Hey...

247
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,790
Al!

248
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,920
Win this, Brother.

249
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,800
Don't do it!!!

250
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,240
Was that enough for you?

251
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:40,320
Yeah.

252
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,740
All that's left for me to do now is to believe in him.

253
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:16,860
Yo. Looks like you got your soul back.

254
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,860
Think he'll come here to bring you back?

255
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,110
He will. I know he will.

256
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,580
I'm curious to see what he'll sacrifice to do so.

257
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,010
You idiot!!

258
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,920
It's working.

259
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,840
He... He has a chance!

260
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,500
Keep it up!

261
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,710
Kiddo!!

262
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,970
That's the spirit!

263
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,380
Get him, kid!

264
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,470
Rush in!

265
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,840
Edward!

266
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,390
Ed!

267
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,220
Edward Elric!

268
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,270
Go!!

269
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,230
Greed.

270
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,400
Isn't this...

271
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,650
...what you've always wanted more than anything?

272
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,400
Mr. Edward!

273
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,650
Edward!

274
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:47,660
Go!

275
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,410
Fullmetal!

276
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,160
Yeah, you're right on target.

277
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,620
What I've always wanted...

278
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,510
...are friends like these.

279
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,560
Get up, punk!

280
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,070
I'll show you the difference between us!

281
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,800
Ano hi kara zutto

282
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,800
Ever since that day passed,

283
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,050
I promised myself that I'd never cry.

284
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,050
Nakanaito kimetekitakedo

285
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:51,600
But even while I hoarded up the pain,

286
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:51,600
Itami wo kasanetemo

287
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,710
there was something I couldn't forgive myself for.

288
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,710
Nanika wo yurusezu ni ita

289
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,150
I'll never be able

290
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,150
Mou modorenai

291
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,650
to return to those days.

292
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,650
Ikutsumo no hibi

293
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:07,740
I'm still powerless.

294
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:07,740
Boku wa mada nanimo dekizuni

295
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:12,990
I watch as the shards of memories disappear, one by one;

296
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:12,990
Kimi no ita kioku no kakera

297
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:18,860
memories of when you were still with me.

298
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:18,860
Mata hitotsu kieteyuku

299
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,880
I long to become

300
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,880
Kyou yori motto

301
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,630
Tsuyoku naritai

302
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,630
stronger than I am now,

303
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:29,770
so that my voice will eventually reach you.

304
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:29,770
Kono koe ga itsuka todokuyouni

305
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,140
If the wind happens to stop

306
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,140
Arukitsuzukete

307
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,850
in the midst of my long journey,

308
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,850
Kaze ga yandara

309
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:39,560
I'll look up at the sky in search of you.

310
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:39,560
Kimi wo sagashite sora miageruyo

311
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:46,900
Yoake no saki ni hikari ga sasuyo

312
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:46,900
Beyond the daybreak, a ray of light breaks free.

313
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:52,450
A rainbow spans across the sky.

314
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:52,450
Niji ga kakaruyo

315
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,790
His power could bring anything about.

316
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,250
However, he does not hesitate.

317
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:10,090
Not when it is to protect the ones he loves.

318
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,350
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

319
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:19,870
Episode 63, The Other Side of the Gateway.

320
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:19,870
The Other Side
of the Gateway

321
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:25,400
He fades away after overseeing all.
