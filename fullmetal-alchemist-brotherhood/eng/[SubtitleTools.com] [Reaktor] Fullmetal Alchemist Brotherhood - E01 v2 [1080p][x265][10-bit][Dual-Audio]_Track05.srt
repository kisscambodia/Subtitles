1
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,940
The Ice Alchemist?

2
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,360
Yes. He has infiltrated Central.

3
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,990
I'd like you to take command of his capture, Col. Roy Mustang.

4
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,410
Yes, sir.

5
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,120
I'm thankful you were in Central at this time.

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,830
I can leave this to you without reservation.

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,870
Oh, and that boy is here as well.

8
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,000
Utilize him to your liking.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,510
Führer President Bradley, by "boy", do you mean...

10
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,220
Yes. The Fullmetal Alchemist, Edward Elric.

11
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,220
Geez, that Colonel is a slave driver.

12
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:52,480
And we'd just bought a train ticket to Lior, too. Guess we're going to have to cancel that.

13
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,890
Well, nothing we can do.

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,270
Let's get this over with quick, Al.

15
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,730
All right, Brother.

16
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,700
I've still got a lot of years ahead of me

17
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,700
Kono omoi wo keshiteshimau niwa

18
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,620
To just erase these feelings?

19
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,710
Mada jinsei nagai desho?

20
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:04,660
To just erase these feelings?

21
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:04,710
To just erase these feelings?

22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,710
I want to go back and finish

23
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,710
Yarinokoshiteru koto

24
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,340
The things that I've yet to finish.

25
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,340
Yarinaoshite mitai kara

26
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:27,600
I was supposed to be chasing after my ongoing dream,

27
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:27,600
Yume no tsuzuki oikaketeita hazu nanoni

28
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Yet I faltered over others while walking this thin, winding path.

29
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Magarikunetta hosoi michi hito ni tsumazuku

30
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,110
It's not that I want to return to those days.

31
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,110
Ano koro mitainitte modoritai wake ja nai no

32
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,620
I'm searching for the sky I lost.

33
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,620
Nakushitekita sora wo sagashiteru

34
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,280
Don't make that sad face, as if you've fallen victim.

35
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,280
Wakatte kuremasu youni

36
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,500
As if you want people to pity you.

37
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,500
Gisei ni natta youna kanashii kao wa yameteyo

38
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,210
Tears aren't the end of your sins.

39
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,210
Tsumi no saigo wa namida ja nai yo

40
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,880
You have to bear them painfully, forever.

41
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,880
Zutto kurushiku seottekunda

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,540
Who are you waiting for in the maze of emotions,

43
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,540
Deguchi mienai kanjoumeiro ni

44
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,210
Where you can't even see the exit?

45
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,210
Dare wo matteruno?

46
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,010
I want to blurt it out more justly,

47
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,010
Shiroi nooto ni tsuzutta youni

48
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,760
Motto sunao ni hakidashitai yo

49
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,760
Just like how I wrote it in my white notebook.

50
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,430
What do you want to run from?

51
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,430
Nani kara nogaretainda

52
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,050
That thing called "reality"?

53
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,050
Genjitsu tte yatsu?

54
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,390
I just want to scream out,

55
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,390
Kanaeru tame ni ikiterundatte

56
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,810
"I'm only living to fulfill my wish." Can you hear me?

57
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,810
Sakebitaku naru yo kikoeteimasuka?

58
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:11,940
I can't take the safe way out of everything.

59
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:11,940
Bunan ni nante yatterarenaikara

60
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,730
Kaeru basho mo nai no

61
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,730
I don't even have a place to return to.

62
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,030
I'm always thankful for everyone's kindness,

63
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,030
Yasashisa ni wa itsumo kansha shiteru

64
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,410
That's why I want to become stronger. (I'm on the way)

65
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,410
Dakara tsuyoku naritai (I'm on the way)

66
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,370
This is reminding me of the old days.

67
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,370
Natsukashiku naru

68
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,620
This pain is all right with me.

69
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,620
Konna itami mo kangei jan

70
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,290
There he is! That way!

71
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,790
Stop! If you don't...

72
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,310
Freezing and boiling. The elements of water.

73
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,270
Alchemy...

74
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,860
That's pretty horrible.

75
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,950
Sacrifices are inherent when attempting something great.

76
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,110
It's called the exchange of equivalences.

77
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,790
This and that aren't  the same thing!

78
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,290
Without a transmutation circle?!

79
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,380
You've got no time to be gawking!

80
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,020
What?!

81
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:39,310
There's no way!

82
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,810
It should have boiled if there was a drop of liquid in it!

83
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,940
You ruined my coat.

84
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,320
Auto-mail...

85
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:56,290
Genius alchemy skills that don't require transmutation circles...

86
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,500
...and an auto-mail as his right arm.

87
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,000
So you're...

88
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,170
...that Fullmetal Alchemist, Edward Elric!

89
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,990
Fullmetal Alchemist

90
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,800
Wait... that's not you?

91
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,260
Umm... well...

92
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,760
I'm Alphonse, his younger brother.

93
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,140
So this runt is...

94
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,760
Who are you calling short?!

95
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,860
To think that someone with the title of "Fullmetal Alchemist"...

96
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,940
...would be such a small child...

97
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,110
Quit calling me short!!!

98
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,990
Brother, I don't think he was talking about your height.

99
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,540
Even so, I can't forgive him!

100
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:43,040
As expected from Edward Elric, the Fullmetal Alchemist.

101
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,040
We appreciate your support.

102
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,260
Oh no, I'm his little brother, Alphonse Elric.

103
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,340
Sorry to make you wait, Al.

104
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,550
Let's go.

105
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,550
Geez, you're in such a rush...

106
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,440
Steam...

107
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,030
Brother, he's...

108
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,030
Damn him, using petty tricks!

109
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:19,410
Looks like you underestimated your opponent, Fullmetal.

110
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,160
Who the hell is he?

111
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,210
That's why I told you to listen up earlier.

112
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,500
But you claimed that you would be able to-

113
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,050
Yeah, yeah, I get it. My mistake.

114
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,220
You should always listen to your seniors.

115
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,550
Yeah, yeah.

116
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,760
In any case...

117
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,260
His name is Isaac McDougal.

118
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,440
He used to be a State Alchemist and was called Isaac of the Ice.

119
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,600
Used to?

120
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
That's right.

121
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:53,570
He performed outstandingly during
the Ishbal War as a member of our army.

122
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:02,740
He gave up his title of State Alchemist after the war and became involved in a dissident movement.

123
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,750
Capturing him is a top priority.

124
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,670
But if circumstances dictate it, we may have to kill him.

125
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,550
I'm not going to kill.

126
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,880
Do as you wish.

127
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,260
All we really want are results.

128
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,260
By the way,

129
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,470
have you found any clues on how to fix your body?

130
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,480
Like you'd give us time for that!

131
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,310
Yo, Roy.

132
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:34,780
What a rough order, capturing the Ice Alchemist, eh?

133
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,490
Or could this be a chance for a promotion?

134
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,870
Whoa! Are you two perhaps... the Elric Brothers?

135
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:47,500
Oh man, I'm quite honored to be able to meet the youngest State Alchemist.

136
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,500
I'm Maes Hughes, a Lieutenant Colonel.

137
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,340
U-Umm... I'm Alphonse Elric, the younger brother.

138
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,800
What?! That  one is the Fullmetal Alchemist?!

139
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,260
You'd better not call me a shrimp...

140
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,300
Hughes.

141
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,180
Yo.

142
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,350
If you don't have anything to do here, go home already.

143
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,680
I will, after I do what I need to.

144
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,640
You guys probably haven't booked a place to stay yet, right?

145
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,520
If so, stay at my place.

146
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,450
It's my wife, Gracia, and my daughter, Elicia.

147
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,080
Elicia-chan~

148
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:29,710
Ow, Daddy! Your beard hurts!

149
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,460
Oh really?

150
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,000
Rub-rub-rub.

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,090
Nooo!

152
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,170
Say hi to our guests, the Elric Brothers.

153
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,340
So tall!

154
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,300
So short!

155
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,020
Elicia-chan, I'm Edward Elric.

156
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,810
This is my little brother, Alphonse Elric.

157
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,940
Understand? Little brother.

158
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,320
If you're the older one, how come you're so short?

159
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,320
Now, now, they're letting us stay. Calm down.

160
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,240
Lemme go! Lemme go, Al!

161
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,410
Let's start dinner. Gracia is a great cook.

162
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,250
Whoa!

163
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,450
Come on, eat up.

164
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,870
Itadakimasu!

165
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,550
It's so good! Wow, it tastes great!

166
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,000
Eat a lot, okay?

167
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,630
Okay!

168
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,390
Oh, Alphonse, you can't eat with that armor on, can you?

169
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,720
O-Oh, this is...

170
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,770
Al is... in the middle of an alchemy training right now!

171
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,060
All right, Al. I'll eat for the both of us like always, okay?

172
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,520
Leave it to me, leave it to me!

173
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,520
Training~ Training~

174
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,520
Central Prison

175
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,700
That's the funniest joke I've heard in a while.

176
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,290
Join forces with the Ice Alchemist?

177
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,290
Me, the Crimson Alchemist?

178
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,880
Kimbley, let's defeat Bradley
and the corrupt military, together.

179
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,760
I know you've seen it at Ishbal, too. That hell.

180
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,850
You know what Bradley made us do.

181
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,310
That's why you killed those officers, is it not?

182
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,400
Oh no, please don't misunderstand me.

183
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,730
I wasn't thinking of anything lofty like you are.

184
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,320
The reason I killed them...

185
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,320
...is because I wanted to. That's it.

186
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,660
It's a shame, Kimbley.

187
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,330
It really is.

188
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,250
Thanks.

189
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,760
This is rare. You can't sleep?

190
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,890
Yeah.

191
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,730
Should I take a guess?

192
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,690
You were thinking about those two, weren't you?

193
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:06,820
State Alchemists are called
the "dogs of the military" by the public.

194
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,620
When I think that he has to carry such a burden at such an age...

195
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,250
Brother, are you awake?

196
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,170
Gracia-san's quiche was just like Mom's, don't you think?

197
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,010
Yeah, it tasted great.

198
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:24,760
Really?

199
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,890
Then I'd better add that to my
"List of things to eat when I get my body back".

200
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,390
Yeah, you'd better do that!

201
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,220
Brother?

202
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,230
Hmm?

203
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,690
It would be nice to get our bodies back to normal soon, wouldn't it?

204
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:39,980
Yeah.

205
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,070
Just one more...

206
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:51,580
With just one more, Bradley will fall straight to hell.

207
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:03,650
According to reports, Isaac infiltrated Central Prison last night.

208
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:07,400
We cannot let the situation continue any longer. Make sure you seek him out.

209
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:11,370
Block the roads and search everywhere.

210
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,240
You are authorized to shoot him on sight for all I care.

211
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,450
This is an order from the Führer President!

212
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,630
I... will be heading out, as well!

213
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,500
Hurry, relief soldiers!

214
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,630
Five casualties so far. Report to headquarters!

215
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,010
This is horrible...

216
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,880
It was a steam explosion...

217
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,720
If the temperature of water is raised rapidly, it expands explosively.

218
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,350
A human body is 70% water, after all.

219
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,810
Let's hurry. We have to find that guy fast.

220
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:39,560
Yeah.

221
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,190
There.

222
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,910
To dodge my alchemy... As expected of you, Sir Isaac.

223
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,120
That voice... Armstrong!

224
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,950
Precisely!

225
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,540
The Strong Arm Alchemist,

226
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,960
Alex Louis Armstrong!

227
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,880
Take this!

228
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,680
High-pressure water slashes through a variety of things!

229
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,720
It's quite meaningless against my fist, though!

230
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,230
Major!

231
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,280
Watch out!

232
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,240
Water from a canteen, eh?

233
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,660
Thanks, Al.

234
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,120
We've got to go after him, Brother.

235
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,250
Let's go, Elric Brothers!

236
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,040
Yes!

237
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,040
Right!

238
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,510
It's been a while, Ice.

239
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,720
Roy Mustang...

240
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,680
...no, the Flame Alchemist.

241
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,560
It's a shame that I must fight a past comrade.

242
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,980
Comrade? I do not have any friends.

243
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,820
The only ones that were at Ishbal were the corrupted army and their dogs!

244
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,040
It's just fire, after all.

245
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,500
It can't win against water!

246
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,000
Dammit!

247
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,760
Good, good...

248
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,760
That's it for you!

249
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,770
I was wondering what the heck you were doing in an alley like this back then...

250
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:41,980
...so I came back, and bingo.

251
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,770
No use trying to run away.

252
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:49,400
Run? There's no need for that.

253
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,830
A simultaneous alchemy reaction... like this?

254
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,330
No way...

255
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,830
Don't tell me... could this be...

256
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,340
The Philosopher's Stone!

257
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,220
What?!

258
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,680
It's freezing all of the moisture in the atmosphere...

259
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,050
Edward Elric.

260
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,730
Dog of the military. State Alchemist!

261
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,690
Do you have any idea what this country is trying to do?!

262
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,230
Hell if I know! More importantly...

263
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:34,240
If you did  know, you'd understand why I'm doing this!

264
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,240
I told you, I don't know!

265
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,000
All right, Al, good work!

266
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,130
Brother, his alchemy...

267
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:49,830
Yeah!

268
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,840
Hey, you!

269
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,130
You have the philosopher's stone, don't you?!

270
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,130
What are you talking about?

271
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,380
If you're not going to tell me, then I'll make you!

272
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,890
Is this really the time to be blabbering nonsense?!

273
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:14,400
A skill that has been passed down
the Armstrong household for generations...

274
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,400
We're leaving it to you, Major!

275
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,320
Artistic Alchemy!

276
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,910
Engrave it on your soul!!

277
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,120
What?!

278
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,040
What the hell are you doing, Major?!

279
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,420
No, I...

280
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,470
The wall of ice...

281
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,010
...is connecting....

282
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,640
Could it be... that man...

283
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,640
...is trying to freeze Central...

284
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,560
...no, Central Headquarters?!

285
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:53,020
Major! Al and I will stop that guy.

286
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,020
While we're on that, please take care of the transmutation circles!

287
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,400
I need to destroy them, right? Got it!

288
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,790
King Bradley! Now is finally the time for me to to send you to hell with my ice!

289
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,830
Now wait just a second!

290
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,050
Out of the way!

291
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,510
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

292
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,980
Brother!

293
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,440
Too slow!

294
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:34,690
Al!

295
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,620
An... empty armor?!

296
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:52,330
You... established a soul on to a piece of armor?!

297
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,000
Losing an arm...

298
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,130
...and the little brother is left without a body...

299
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,420
I get it now. You guys...

300
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,220
...committed taboo, didn't you!

301
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,680
The greatest taboo an alchemist can commit...

302
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,190
Human Transmutation!!!

303
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,480
Al!!! Alphonse!!!

304
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,230
Shit! This isn't how it was supposed to be!

305
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:25,320
Dammit!!! They took it away!!!

306
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,620
Give him back... He's my little brother...

307
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:34,080
Give him back... He's my only brother!!

308
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:45,300
You... just took a step toward hell.

309
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:05,740
Just give up!

310
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,740
There's no water for you to use.

311
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,370
You've forgotten...

312
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:12,500
...what 70% of the human body is made of!

313
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Brother!

314
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:23,550
You guys don't know the true face of this country!

315
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,270
Brother... Brother!

316
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,940
Al, we're going after him.

317
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,940
Using little tricks like these...

318
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,110
Did we do it?

319
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,200
Again?!

320
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,500
Don't you dare underestimate my flames!

321
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,000
Seriously...

322
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:04,010
Keep your useless days to rainy days only, please.

323
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,100
Bradley!

324
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,360
Brace yourself!

325
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,230
Too bad for you.

326
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:09,860
Major! Now!

327
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,740
Roger that!

328
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,720
Führer President King Bradley...

329
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:42,650
Ah, good work, Fullmetal Alchemist.

330
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:50,490
I now have something to brag to my son about, that I was able to lend you a helping hand.

331
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,200
What, you've caught a cold?

332
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,450
Anyway, I heard you were great out there!

333
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,620
All I did was destroy the transmutation circles.

334
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,330
The Führer President defeated him.

335
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,750
And the Führer President is saying that it was your work.

336
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,130
What, are you unsatisfied?

337
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,260
Accept his words thankfully.

338
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,720
You've always said this, haven't you?

339
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,890
"You should always listen to your seniors."

340
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,360
In the end, we never found out whether he had a philosopher's stone or not.

341
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,360
Yeah, we're going to have to wait for the investigation by the army.

342
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,950
Edward Elric, I heard you were hospitalized, and...

343
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,030
...I came here right away!

344
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:42,290
Now, how about I comfort you while you're bored out of your mind from being hospitalized!

345
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,460
Don't they just bring warmth to your heart? These graceful muscles of mine.

346
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,630
Don't be shy, now. You can touch them.

347
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:53,260
Stop it!!!

348
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:59,930
I see. So Isaac died.

349
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:03,100
He was a human pillar, too. That's too bad.

350
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,270
And? What about the philosopher's stone?

351
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,020
Oh, so he used it all up.

352
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:13,570
Gluttony, you're not supposed to be eating weird things.

353
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,820
Yeah, it's all going well in Lior.

354
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,280
It will begin soon.

355
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,250
Very soon.

356
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:33,120
Say, the sky we saw that day, the scarlet sky.

357
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:33,120
Ano hi mita sora akaneiro no sora wo

358
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,340
Do you remember it from that day?

359
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,340
Nee kimi wa oboeteimasuka

360
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:44,260
We made a promise and a vow while the early summer wind circled us.

361
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:44,260
Yakusoku chigiri shoka no kaze ga tsutsumu

362
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:48,510
And we clung close together.

363
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:48,510
Futari yorisotta

364
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:57,560
Your forced smile

365
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:57,560
Muri na egao no ura

366
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:02,940
Holds elongated shadows.

367
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:02,940
Nobita kage wo kakumau

368
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:12,200
I pretend not to notice and continue on.

369
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:12,200
Dakara kizukanu furi saisei wo erabu

370
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:21,710
All the while waiting for you to deliver some news at the table.

371
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:21,710
Teeburu no ue no furuenai shirase machitsuzukete

372
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:30,100
Empty nights, mornings that will never arrive,

373
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:30,100
Kuuhaku no yoru mo kuru hazu no nai asa mo

374
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,850
I could see them from a mile away.

375
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,850
Zenbu wakattetanda

376
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:40,480
Say, the sky we saw that day, the scarlet sky.

377
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:40,480
Ano hi mita sora akaneiro no sora wo

378
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,400
I'm sure you'll remember it one day.

379
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,400
Nee itsuka omoidasu deshou

380
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:51,240
While holding the promise we couldn't keep,

381
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:51,240
Hatasenakatta yakusoku wo idaite

382
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,500
We take our first steps down our own paths.

383
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,500
Futari arukidasu

384
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:01,790
Resembul.

385
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:07,380
The kind town where the boys were born and spent their childhood with their mother.

386
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,260
Seeking for that smile that was lost,

387
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:14,180
the boys commit taboo and witness the "truth".

388
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:19,600
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

389
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,910
The First Day

390
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,890
Episode 2, The First Day.

391
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,690
It was his heart that decided to step out into the world.
