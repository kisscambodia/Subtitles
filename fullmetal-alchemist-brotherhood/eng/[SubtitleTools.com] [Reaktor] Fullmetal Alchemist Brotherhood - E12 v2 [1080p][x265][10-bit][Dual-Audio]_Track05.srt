1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,920
I've still got a lot of years ahead of me

2
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,920
Kono omoi wo keshiteshimau niwa

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:05,810
To just erase these feelings?

4
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:05,900
Mada jinsei nagai desho?

5
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:05,850
To just erase these feelings?

6
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:05,900
To just erase these feelings?

7
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,900
I want to go back and finish

8
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,900
Yarinokoshiteru koto

9
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,530
The things that I've yet to finish.

10
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,530
Yarinaoshite mitai kara

11
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:28,790
I was supposed to be chasing after my ongoing dream,

12
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:28,790
Yume no tsuzuki oikaketeita hazu nanoni

13
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:35,130
Yet I faltered over others while walking this thin, winding path.

14
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:35,130
Magarikunetta hosoi michi hito ni tsumazuku

15
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,300
It's not that I want to return to those days.

16
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,300
Ano koro mitainitte modoritai wake ja nai no

17
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,810
I'm searching for the sky I lost.

18
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,810
Nakushitekita sora wo sagashiteru

19
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,480
Don't make that sad face, as if you've fallen victim.

20
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,480
Wakatte kuremasu youni

21
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,690
Gisei ni natta youna kanashii kao wa yameteyo

22
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,690
As if you want people to pity you.

23
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,400
Tears aren't the end of your sins.

24
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,400
Tsumi no saigo wa namida ja nai yo

25
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,070
You have to bear them painfully, forever.

26
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,070
Zutto kurushiku seottekunda

27
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,740
Who are you waiting for in the maze of emotions,

28
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,740
Deguchi mienai kanjoumeiro ni

29
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,400
Where you can't even see the exit?

30
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,400
Dare wo matteruno?

31
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,200
Shiroi nooto ni tsuzutta youni

32
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,200
I want to blurt it out more justly,

33
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,950
Just like how I wrote it in my white notebook.

34
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,950
Motto sunao ni hakidashitai yo

35
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,620
What do you want to run from?

36
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,620
Nani kara nogaretainda

37
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,240
That thing called "reality"?

38
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,240
Genjitsu tte yatsu?

39
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,580
I just want to scream out,

40
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,580
Kanaeru tame ni ikiterundatte

41
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,000
"I'm only living to fulfill my wish." Can you hear me?

42
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,000
Sakebitaku naru yo kikoeteimasuka?

43
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,130
Bunan ni nante yatterarenaikara

44
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,130
I can't take the safe way out of everything.

45
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,920
I don't even have a place to return to.

46
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,920
Kaeru basho mo nai no

47
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,220
I'm always thankful for everyone's kindness,

48
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,220
Yasashisa ni wa itsumo kansha shiteru

49
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,600
That's why I want to become stronger. (I'm on the way)

50
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,600
Dakara tsuyoku naritai (I'm on the way)

51
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,560
This is reminding me of the old days.

52
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,560
Natsukashiku naru

53
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,810
This pain is all right with me.

54
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,810
Konna itami mo kangei jan

55
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
One is All, All is One

56
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,160
We're almost at Dublith, Brother.

57
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:51,990
Were you dreaming?

58
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,040
Yeah.

59
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,500
A dream about him.

60
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,840
We're finally here, aren't we?

61
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,720
Yup.

62
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,550
I hope the Master isn't home...

63
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,430
Yeah...

64
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,940
H-Hi...

65
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,440
It's been a while...

66
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,240
Welcome.

67
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,820
You've gotten bigger.

68
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,490
I-I'm going to shrink...

69
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,450
Hi... It's me, Alphonse.

70
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,330
It's been a while.

71
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,920
You've really  gotten bigger.

72
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,380
That's the first time I've been patted on the head since I became like this.

73
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,340
Izumi, the Elric runts are here.

74
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,970
Think you can get up?

75
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,510
I'm fine.

76
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,550
I'm not feeling too bad today.

77
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,260
I guess she was lying down because she wasn't feeling well.

78
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,560
Has her body not healed yet?

79
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,200
You're one idiot of a disciple!

80
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,580
What's this I hear about you becoming a dog of the military?!

81
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,670
Master! W-Well... about this...

82
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,170
Al! Look at how much you've grown!

83
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,300
You haven't changed much either, Mast-

84
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,890
You've slacked on your training!

85
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,100
Oww...

86
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,400
I thought you weren't feeling well?

87
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,900
Forget about that! I'm out of bed like this because I heard you guys were here...

88
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,400
Don't push yourself.

89
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,700
You're worried about me, Dear?

90
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,540
I don't know much about the Philosopher's Stone.

91
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,790
Because I'm not interested.

92
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,290
I see...

93
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:10,670
We met an alchemist in Central who knew a lot about the stone, didn't we?

94
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,640
What was he like?

95
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,890
I think his name was...

96
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,720
...Hohenheim.

97
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,190
What's the matter?

98
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,700
So he's alive...

99
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,240
You know him?

100
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,870
He's our father.

101
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,870
So the one who left a long time ago...

102
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,410
That bastard!

103
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,670
It's his fault Mom died.

104
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:48,750
Because of him...

105
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,600
Oh! What are you doing up so early?

106
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,810
Al said he needed to pee...

107
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,980
Oh, so you were taking care of Al.

108
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,810
Thank you, Ed.

109
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,590
Mom, where's Dad?

110
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,600
He left.

111
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,510
When's he coming back?

112
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,310
Tickle tickle tickle!

113
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,730
Tickle tickle tickle!

114
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,070
He'll be back in no time.

115
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,190
Hurry and finish your meal, now.

116
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,700
Mom...

117
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,950
Mom.

118
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,000
Mom!

119
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,340
Mom!!!

120
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,480
So... did Dad say anything about the stone?

121
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,490
He looked happy, saying something about his wish from long ago will finally be coming true soon.

122
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,490
Ow!

123
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,620
Time to eat!

124
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,830
Okay...

125
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,380
You aren't going to eat, Al?

126
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,880
N-No!

127
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,250
I ate too much on the train...

128
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:58,840
Hey Al, tell them about how we witnessed childbirth over at Rush Valley!

129
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,010
Oh yeah!

130
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:03,720
Master, we helped a baby being born!

131
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,390
Idiot, that doesn't count as "helping".

132
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,940
I learned that people are born because everyone in the family works together,

133
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,480
the mother risks her life, and because the person receives so many blessings from everyone.

134
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,990
That's right.

135
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,240
That's how you two were given life, too.

136
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,490
Be proud that you were born.

137
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,880
Brother.

138
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,790
Hm?

139
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,750
Master hasn't changed at all, has she?

140
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,300
Nope.

141
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,510
She hasn't changed at all since we first met her.

142
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,110
Hang in there!

143
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,110
Bring over some more!

144
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,440
It's going to collapse!

145
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,620
The levee's going to break! Run for high ground!

146
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,780
Brother, look!

147
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,420
Hey, it's dangerous!

148
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,070
This should last for a while.

149
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,070
W-Who are you?

150
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,740
A passing housewife!

151
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,210
Will you please be our master, old lady?!

152
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,880
Please, old lady!

153
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,930
I couldn't catch exactly what you said...

154
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,430
Mind repeating it?

155
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,390
C-Correction!

156
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,480
Please be our master, Miss!

157
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,390
No!

158
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,560
Why not?!

159
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,020
I don't take students.

160
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,860
And besides, we're in the middle of a trip!

161
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,690
Please, accept us as your students!

162
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,900
God, you're so persistent!

163
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,360
Do you even have permission from your parents?!

164
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,240
The thing is... those boys don't have any parents.

165
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,210
I'm so soft when it comes to things like this...

166
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,260
Survive on your own!

167
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,430
Huh?

168
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,300
That's the preliminary round.

169
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,640
If you pass, we'll get to the real training.

170
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,430
And you're not allowed to use alchemy during this preliminary round.

171
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,690
What?

172
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,560
"One is All, All is One."

173
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,320
Find the answer to that within a month.

174
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:05,990
If you can't, I'm sending you back to Resembool.

175
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:09,740
Later!

176
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,870
Huh?!

177
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:17,170
What the heck?!

178
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,710
So hungry...

179
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,010
I want to sleep in a bed, geez...

180
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,020
What part of this is alchemy training?!

181
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,400
So hungry...

182
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,870
I wonder if those kids are all right?

183
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,410
They say there's no substitute for real-life experience.

184
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:01,590
That is the best way to pound the courage portion of alchemy into them.

185
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:07,170
If they don't learn anything from this,
it just means that's the extent of their talents.

186
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,470
They'll have to give up learning from me.

187
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,470
What I'm worried about is the safety of their lives.

188
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:22,060
I was thrown out to Mt. Briggs in the middle of winter for a month during my training!

189
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,730
Don't put yourself and ordinary people at the same level.

190
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:29,740
There's so much to eat on that island; they'll live.

191
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,620
We did it!

192
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,120
How do we eat this?

193
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,500
Hmm... We cut it apart.

194
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,750
Cut it apart...

195
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,300
I don't want to do it!

196
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,760
You do it!

197
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,850
I did the catching; you do the killing.

198
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,180
You always try to make me do all the things you don't want to do!

199
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,900
Get back here!!!

200
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,740
Baby foxes...

201
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,120
Forget meat... let's try for some fish.

202
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,340
How do we catch one?!

203
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,050
We don't have a rod, line, or a needle!

204
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,020
No food, no fire, no nothing...

205
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,400
Don't say that!

206
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:21,980
Geez!

207
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,190
What was that for, Brother?!

208
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,110
Brother?

209
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,210
Sour!

210
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,710
I'm... alive.

211
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,130
Eating ants and living.

212
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,850
Eating life and living.

213
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,230
Living...

214
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,940
We're not going to die here!

215
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,780
Right!

216
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,290
Sorry about this...

217
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,460
You're almost there, Brother.

218
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,260
We did it!

219
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,280
Looks like tomorrow's the end of the month...

220
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,950
Hey Brother,

221
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:09,870
did you ever find the answer to "One is All, All is One"?

222
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,710
I've been thinking about it for the longest time, but I only kind of understand it.

223
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,470
I'm not positive, but...

224
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:24,220
Remember when I ate ants when we were starving and out of it?

225
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,850
You did?

226
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,770
Yep, I did.

227
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,730
They were so sour.

228
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,940
Then, a thought came to my mind.

229
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,820
If I hadn't eaten them and eventually died,

230
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,820
foxes and ants would eat me.

231
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,530
I'd return to the soil and become grass.

232
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,820
And that's what a rabbit would eat.

233
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,620
The food chain, right?

234
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,530
Yeah.

235
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,740
But that's not all.

236
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,540
Even this island could have been underwater in the ancient times.

237
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,750
And tens of thousands of years in the future,
it could be a summit of a mountain.

238
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,300
Everything is connected?

239
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,090
Everything is within a large stream that can't be seen.

240
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,760
I don't know if that stream should be called the universe or the world,

241
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:12,150
but from the point of view of something that big, you and I are like ants.

242
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,650
A small individual within a stream.

243
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,360
We're just "one" within the "all".

244
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:24,620
But only when those "ones" gather together, can an "all" exist.

245
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,580
It's the promised day.

246
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:36,040
Let's hear your answer to "One is All, All is One".

247
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,960
"All" is the world!

248
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,550
And "One" is me!

249
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,550
Good! We can start the real training now.

250
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,470
All right!

251
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,610
A basis of a transmutation circle is the power of the circle.

252
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,400
The circle displays the circulation of power,

253
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:03,450
and by sketching the construction symbol in it,
it becomes possible to activate its power.

254
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,750
This is also a circulation of power.

255
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,210
It's best to experience it for yourself.

256
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,840
Now...

257
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,680
Review it until lunch is ready!

258
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,180
Okay, so...

259
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,850
The circle displays the circulation of power,

260
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:38,480
and by sketching the construction symbol in it,
it becomes possible to activate its power.

261
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:43,320
But you were transmuting by just slapping your palms together, weren't you, Master?

262
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,070
Do you not need to sketch the construction symbols?

263
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:53,080
I am like a construction symbol.

264
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,000
What do you have to do in order to do that?

265
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,010
You might be able to do it if you ever reach the truth.

266
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,510
Master has also seen the truth...

267
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,280
And? What did you want to talk to me about?

268
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,570
W-Well...

269
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,050
As I thought, you can transmute without a construction symbol!

270
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,340
Additionally, Alphonse is an empty suit of armor!

271
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,840
You've got automails for an arm and leg!

272
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,470
How did you know, Master?!

273
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,510
I can tell from just sparring with you!

274
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,520
You... saw it, didn't you?

275
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,150
Am I right?!

276
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,440
Y-Yes, ma'am!

277
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:07,030
Both master and pupil, making the same stupid decisions.

278
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,500
Master, you...

279
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,500
Because you saw that thing...

280
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,880
We had a hard time conceiving a child.

281
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,590
Just when we thought we were having a baby, I fell ill.

282
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,180
Because of that, our child wasn't born into this world alive.

283
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,270
So...

284
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,520
...I committed taboo.

285
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,360
Thanks to that, all sorts of organs were taken from me.

286
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,980
I'm such an idiot.

287
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,450
I should have told you sooner.

288
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,910
It must have been tough.

289
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,830
N-No!

290
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,420
It's something we did to ourselves.

291
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,920
We don't particularly find it tough...

292
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,920
I think about what to eat when I get my body back.

293
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,300
It's quite the opposite; it's more of an anticipation!

294
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,560
Right, Brother?

295
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,180
Yeah!

296
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,600
That's exactly it!

297
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,390
You morons...

298
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,070
No need to force yourselves.

299
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,620
Forgive us...

300
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,880
We're sorry...

301
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,630
Forgive us...

302
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:28,880
We're sorry...

303
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,670
Forgive us...

304
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:31,760
We're sorry...

305
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,880
Forgive us...

306
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:42,770
This world is flowing while abiding by a great rule that's unimaginable.

307
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:47,020
Learning about that flow,
breaking it down, and rebuilding it.

308
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,520
That's what alchemy's all about.

309
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,570
And it's also what living is about, too.

310
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:57,820
The basics of alchemy, breaking
something down and rebuilding it...

311
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,120
That's almost like the food chain.

312
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:05,620
If you eat a rabbit, you break down
its meat and rebuild it into your own body.

313
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,540
And even that rabbit rebuilds
the grass it ate into its own body.

314
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:15,220
Alchemy is life itself.

315
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:33,090
Say, the sky we saw that day, the scarlet sky.

316
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:33,090
Ano hi mita sora akaneiro no sora wo

317
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:38,300
Nee kimi wa oboeteimasuka

318
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:38,300
Do you remember it from that day?

319
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:44,230
We made a promise and a vow while the early summer wind circled us.

320
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:44,230
Yakusoku chigiri shoka no kaze ga tsutsumu

321
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,480
And we clung close together.

322
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,480
Futari yorisotta

323
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:57,530
Your forced smile

324
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:57,530
Muri na egao no ura

325
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:02,910
Holds elongated shadows.

326
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:02,910
Nobita kage wo kakumau

327
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:12,170
I pretend not to notice and continue on.

328
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:12,170
Dakara kizukanu furi saisei wo erabu

329
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:21,680
All the while waiting for you to deliver some news at the table.

330
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:21,680
Teeburu no ue no furuenai shirase machitsuzukete

331
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:30,060
Empty nights, mornings that will never arrive,

332
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:30,060
Kuuhaku no yoru mo kuru hazu no nai asa mo

333
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:34,820
I could see them from a mile away.

334
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:34,820
Zenbu wakattetanda

335
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:40,450
Say, the sky we saw that day, the scarlet sky.

336
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:40,450
Ano hi mita sora akaneiro no sora wo

337
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:45,370
I'm sure you'll remember it one day.

338
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:45,370
Nee itsuka omoidasu deshou

339
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:51,210
Hatasenakatta yakusoku wo idaite

340
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:51,210
While holding the promise we couldn't keep,

341
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:55,460
We take our first steps down our own paths.

342
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:55,460
Futari arukidasu

343
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:01,800
A man who enjoys his own desires.

344
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,090
His name is Greed.

345
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:11,970
Whether he be friend or foe, the figure that stands before Ed and Al is a body made for fighting.

346
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:17,230
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

347
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:21,230
Episode 13, Beasts of Dublith.

348
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,250
Beasts of Dublith

349
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,030
A powerful figure appears before the two.
