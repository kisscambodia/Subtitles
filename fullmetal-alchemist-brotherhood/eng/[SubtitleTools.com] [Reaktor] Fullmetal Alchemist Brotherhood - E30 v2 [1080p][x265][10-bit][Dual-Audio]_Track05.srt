1
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,870
Can't focus. My body is still puzzled about what to do.

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,870
Shuuchuu dekitenaina mada karada ga mayotteirunda

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,630
I'm trembling. I can't stop even if I try to control myself.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,630
Furueteitanja kontoroorushitatte burerunda

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,380
Although neither sun nor moon are on my side,

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,380
Taiyou mo tsuki mo nanmo kanzen ni kocchi muiteinaiga

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,800
"I've no choice but to try,"

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,800
Yarushikanainda

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,470
Those were the words I muttered to myself.

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,470
Iikikaseruyouni sotto tsubuyaita

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,060
Joukyou wa waruiga tada nigedasunja konjou nainaa

12
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,060
The odds aren't on my side, but running way'd be gutless.

13
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,060
Even if I can't see the future, I'll just have to win it over with courage.

14
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,060
Tenbou wa naiga dokyou de kuria suru shika naiya

15
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,560
Need to keep distance from the target as I hold myself back.

16
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,560
Shoudou wa osaetamama taagetto to no kankaku sagure

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,860
All that's needed for victory is pride to win.

18
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,860
Hitsuyou na mon wa katsu puraido

19
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,950
Will we celebrate with the wine of victory

20
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,950
Ajiwau nowa shouri no bishu ka

21
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,950
Or'll we end up kissing their feet in defeat?

22
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,950
Soretomo haiboku no kujuu ka

23
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,700
Sou subete wa futatsu ni hitotsu

24
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,700
There are two outcomes to everything.

25
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,420
I want to control destiny.

26
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,420
Ayatsuritai unmei no ito

27
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,750
I need to seize the golden opportunity with my hands.

28
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,750
Zekkou no goorudentaimu kono te de tsukame

29
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,840
I'll finish it up with my best poker face,

30
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,840
Konshin no pookaafeisu kimete shikakeruyo

31
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,800
And drag them into a world of illusions.

32
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,800
Iryuujon no sekai e hikizurikonde

33
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,140
I'll find my way out of this endless pressure game,

34
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,140
Saigennai puresshaageemu sururito nukete

35
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,150
And leap over the borderline of honor.

36
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,150
Eikou no boodaarain tobikoeru tameni

37
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,860
How many? What'll I need to sacrifice to make it happen?

38
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,860
Haumenii? Dorekurai no daishou ga iru?

39
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,120
What is the one thing I don't want to let go?

40
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,120
Tebanashitakunai mon wa dore?

41
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,150
So in the end, you became a soldier.

42
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:43,530
As I thought, it's far too early to teach you the art of flame alchemy.

43
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,740
Still, sir?

44
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,910
You've only taught me the basics of alchemy so far.

45
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,040
Of course.

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:00,710
Someone who would sink to becoming a dog of the military is unworthy of being taught even the basics of alchemy.

47
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,720
Alchemy should be used for the benefit of the masses. Isn't that correct?

48
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:13,480
Master, we're currently under threat from neighboring countries. We're in an urgent need to strengthen our forces.

49
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,310
Alchemy is essential for protecting the people-

50
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,270
I'm tired of hearing that same excuse.

51
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,320
I just can't sit here and watch this.

52
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:32,080
Someone as talented as you suffering crushing poverty.

53
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,330
Please become a State Alchemist.

54
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,580
If you do, you'll be able to conduct other experiments-

55
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,590
I've already completed my experiments long in the past.

56
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,800
What did you...

57
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,550
The most powerful alchemy.

58
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,970
Though depending on how it's used, it could be the most deadly.

59
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,680
I perfected it...

60
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,810
...and became satisfied.

61
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:03,570
Alchemists are creatures who must continually strive toward the truth as long as they are alive.

62
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,360
They die as soon as they stop the process of thinking.

63
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:12,410
I had already died long in the past-

64
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,200
Master!

65
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,420
Master!

66
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,330
Master Hawkeye!

67
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,540
Take care... of my daughter...

68
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:28,340
Every detail of my experiment... is with her...

69
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,120
The Ishvalan War
of Extermination

70
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:42,520
I'm sorry for having to rely on you for everything.

71
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,190
Don't worry about it.

72
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,940
It's my duty as a former student.

73
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,700
Don't hesitate to visit me at the military if anything happens.

74
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,960
Are you also going to judge me for becoming a soldier?

75
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:02,420
As everyone may say, there is a chance I'll end up dying like a piece of trash out on the street.

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,550
But even then, if it means I'll be able to protect this country, I don't mind at all.

77
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,930
Sorry if I'm boring you. It's a childish dream of mine.

78
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,140
No.

79
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,560
I think it's quite admirable.

80
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,810
A future where everyone will be able to live in happiness.

81
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,070
Can I trust you?

82
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,900
Can I entrust you with Father's dreams?

83
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,210
Hayate. No.

84
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,130
I'm sorry about that.

85
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,800
It's fine... It happens a lot.

86
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,010
I heard about it.

87
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,550
Assistant to the Führer President?

88
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,810
Yeah.

89
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,190
Looks like you had a rough time out there.

90
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,690
I didn't shoot anybody.

91
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,480
Didn't have to.

92
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,860
No... I couldn't bring myself to.

93
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,490
I'm worthless.

94
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,120
Because I'm not prepared, I end up troubling others.

95
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,120
Did something happen?

96
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,800
Scar was the one who killed Winry's parents.

97
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:35,430
I had a horrible feeling in my gut at that time.

98
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,810
In my mind, the gun suddenly turned into something horrifying.

99
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,850
And when I realized it...

100
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:47,770
I think she despised Scar enough to kill him.

101
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,900
I'd never seen her cry as much as she did after he left.

102
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,570
I'm so worthless.

103
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,660
I didn't understand her feelings at all.

104
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,080
You can only worry about something like that because you came back alive.

105
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,420
But you have to survive...

106
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,040
...for the sake of the people important to you.

107
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,670
You have to protect her, okay?

108
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,550
You love Winry, don't you?

109
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,680
N-No! I-I-

110
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,020
S-She's just a childhood friend of mine!

111
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,230
J-Just like family!

112
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,100
P-Protecting her is nothing out of the ordinary!

113
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:26,440
Umm...

114
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,560
Sorry.

115
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,400
Looks like this was a burden on you.

116
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,660
Have you ever thought of it as a burden?

117
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:46,500
I don't even have the right to complain about its weight anymore.

118
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,920
I've taken the lives of many people in the past,

119
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,170
and I'm also the one who chose this path.

120
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,090
Are you referring to Ishbal?

121
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,810
Do you mind if I ask you about it?

122
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,190
Let me hear it.

123
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,190
What did you wretches do in Ishbal?!

124
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,700
Ishbal was a rough place to live, full of rocks and sand.

125
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:28,870
So it's only fitting that a strict religion and
a tenacious race of people reside there.

126
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:36,210
But some people were unhappy
that they were annexed to Amestris.

127
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,630
And just then...

128
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:49,520
Because of one bullet, the unhappiness evolved into anger and spread throughout Ishbal.

129
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:59,610
The riot turned into a civil war and continued on for seven years.

130
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,950
Then, one document decided everything.

131
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,620
Executive Order No. 3066.

132
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:13,250
It began the Ishbal Extermination.

133
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,960
Just that one sheet of paper.

134
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,520
It was a living hell.

135
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,780
The air was choked with the stench of rotting corpses and gunpowder,

136
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,950
and the sand was soaked with blood.

137
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:55,000
An infantryman could fire at random, and if lucky, he might hit someone.

138
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,300
But sniping is different.

139
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,630
When you pull the trigger, someone dies for sure.

140
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:05,640
The two groups who were the most closely related in terms of that...

141
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,010
...would be snipers...

142
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,980
...and State Alchemists.

143
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:18,150
My name is Basque Gran, the Iron Blood Alchemist!

144
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,110
Iron and Blood.

145
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,530
In other words, Weapons and Soldiers.

146
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:27,700
Who else would be more fitting to stand at the forefront?

147
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,820
Damn you!

148
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,410
Ishbalan brats!

149
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,750
How... How dare you!

150
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,210
Roy!

151
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,920
Roy Mustang!

152
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,630
So you were here, too.

153
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,130
It's been a while.

154
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,470
But man,

155
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,840
your eyes look different.

156
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,470
Same with you.

157
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,770
We all have the eyes of murderers.

158
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,980
Yeah.

159
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:44,280
Didn't we all talk about the future of this country at the military academy?

160
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,240
Yeah.

161
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,990
A beautiful future.

162
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,530
Captain, a letter for you.

163
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,490
Thanks.

164
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,210
Whoa!

165
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,000
W-What?

166
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,120
My beautiful future!

167
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,170
Her name's Gracia!

168
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:04,050
She's waiting for my return in Central!

169
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,010
Alone...

170
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,430
What if other guys hit on her?!

171
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,350
No, there's no way Gracia would cheat on a handsome guy like me.

172
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,980
No, no, but still...

173
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,690
Hughes, let me warn you.

174
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,770
This happens a lot in both movies and novels.

175
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,940
The guy who talks about his lover on a battlefield...

176
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,030
...ends up dying right away.

177
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,320
Hey!

178
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:36,040
This is what keeps me alive.

179
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,630
This letter, and this letter only, lets me dream of tomorrow.

180
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,550
In this war that may never end.

181
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:49,180
You're right. There's no telling when this war will end.

182
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:55,810
No matter how many troops the country deploys, the desert just absorbs them like water.

183
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:00,150
We suffer, conquer, and what's left?

184
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,560
Nothing but sand.

185
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,150
Yeah. It's far too big of an operation for it to merely be suppression.

186
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,990
It's been a while, Major Mustang.

187
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,500
Do you remember me?

188
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,540
How terrible.

189
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
This woman...

190
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,710
...now also bears the eyes of murderers.

191
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,470
Please tell me, Major.

192
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:41,690
Soldiers are supposed to protect the people. Why are we killing them instead?

193
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:48,190
Alchemy is supposed to bring people happiness. Why is it being used for murder?

194
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,070
Because that's the State Alchemists' job.

195
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:57,830
Why are soldiers killing the people?

196
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:00,960
Because that's what we were ordered to do.

197
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,040
Am I wrong?

198
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,670
Are you telling us to look at this horrible scene rationally?!

199
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:10,130
Let's see... for example...

200
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:15,800
Girl, your face has the expression of "I'm doing this against my will".

201
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,890
Can you say for certain that there hasn't been a time...

202
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:27,650
...when you successfully sniped your enemy and felt good about your skill?

203
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,280
Miss Sniper.

204
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,530
That's enough!

205
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:36,320
From my point of view, it's you all who can't be understood.

206
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,200
A battlefield is a place for murder.

207
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,710
Did you put on that uniform
without being prepared to kill?

208
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,460
Don't look away from death. Look forward to it.

209
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:54,220
When you kill, face them directly.

210
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,720
And don't forget them.

211
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,560
Your enemies will never forget you either.

212
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,730
Oh, it's time.

213
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,020
I need to head off to work.

214
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,690
I have to go, too.

215
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,570
Later, Roy.

216
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,570
Hughes.

217
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,070
Why do you fight?

218
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,530
Easy.

219
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:21,830
I don't want to die. That's it.

220
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,580
Reasons are always simple.

221
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,680
Then what is the reason behind this war?!

222
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,260
There...

223
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:42,310
...was a reason. A horrible reason.

224
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:20,180
You created a philosopher's stone using our blood?!

225
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,180
What did you do with that stone?!

226
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:26,060
It went to the hands of Major Zolf J. Kimblee...

227
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,770
...the Crimson Alchemist...

228
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,690
The man with cold eyes...
who has his long black hair tied back?

229
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:34,780
Yeah.

230
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,360
Brother...

231
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,030
What else?!

232
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:45,660
Th-The war situation changed with just one intention.

233
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,920
Ah... Such beautiful sounds.

234
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:55,550
Such wondrous sounds ringing throughout my body...

235
00:15:55,550 --> 00:16:00,050
My spinal cord dances with sadness. My eardrum shivers with joy.

236
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:07,560
This feeling can only be achieved here, where we lay so close to death.

237
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,440
What a wonderful career!

238
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,530
A beautiful sound!!!

239
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:24,410
Amazing! The philosopher's stone!

240
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:32,830
It was only a matter of time before the extermination was complete.

241
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:42,680
And then, the Ishbalan priest of highest rank, Roug Roa, stood before the Führer President to save his people.

242
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,850
Oh?

243
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:50,560
So you want me to trade the lives of the tens of thousands of Ishbalans in exchange for your life?

244
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,690
Correct. I'm-

245
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,860
Don't be conceited.

246
00:16:54,900 --> 00:17:00,280
Are you trying to say that your life is worth just as much as the lives of the ones who are left?

247
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,240
Don't get ahead of yourself, human.

248
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,830
A person's life is worth as much as anyone else's.

249
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:10,500
No more, no less.

250
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,330
I won't accept the deal.

251
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,830
Nor will I call off the extermination.

252
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,460
You monster!

253
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,880
God will smite you!

254
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,840
"God"?

255
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,920
How strange.

256
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:25,140
After all this, I've yet to be smote.

257
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:30,890
How many more Ishbalans must I kill for that to happen?

258
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,600
You bastard...

259
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:38,900
God is only a figure created by humans;
that's all there is to it.

260
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:47,160
If you want to bring an iron hammer down on me,
do it yourself without having to rely on God, human!

261
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,920
And eventually, the war ended,

262
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,800
and we were allowed to go home.

263
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,550
In the end, we soldiers are nothing but trash.

264
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,970
Yeah.

265
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:09,100
One human only has the power to do so much.

266
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,890
That's why I'm going to protect...

267
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,400
...even if it's just a handful of them...

268
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,150
...the ones most important to me.

269
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,610
A subordinate protects their subordinate, and so forth.

270
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:25,530
That should be possible, even for us puny humans.

271
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:48,970
So you decided to take this path,
even after what you experienced in Ishbal?

272
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,300
Yes.

273
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,850
If this world is based on the concept of
equivalent exchange, as stated in alchemy,

274
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:05,650
then we must carry corpses and cross the river of blood in exchange for the new generation to live in happiness.

275
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,990
I'm appointing you as my assistant.

276
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,040
I want you to protect my back.

277
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,500
Do you understand?

278
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:23,300
If I'm leaving you in charge of defending my back,
it means you can shoot me from behind at any time.

279
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,630
If I ever stray from my path,
shoot me right away with those hands.

280
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,300
You have that right.

281
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,470
Will you follow me?

282
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,180
Understood.

283
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,940
If you wish, I will follow you to the depths of Hell.

284
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:49,110
But even if the Colonel becomes the Führer, it wouldn't change the militaristic element of this country!

285
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,910
You're right.

286
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:54,120
Congress pretty much exists as the army's puppet right now.

287
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,710
Someone would need to change that and turn this country into a democracy.

288
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:04,000
For this country to be reborn, all the faults that existed from the militaristic regime will have to be brushed away.

289
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,960
Faults?

290
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:11,970
For example, the government may have to pass judgment on those who committed atrocities during the Ishbal Extermination.

291
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,760
That's right.

292
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:19,640
The heroes during the troubled times are nothing but mass murderers during times of peace.

293
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,560
So the Colonel is reaching for the top while knowing about all this?

294
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,980
He's only on a path of self-destruction!

295
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:30,240
The Homunculi are the ones who were pulling the strings.

296
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:35,740
Even if the Homunculi were the ones who triggered it,
we're the ones who committed the atrocities.

297
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,540
We mustn't turn away from death.

298
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,710
We mustn't forget the ones we killed.

299
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,630
Because...

300
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:48,510
...they'll never forget us, the ones who killed them.

301
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,840
But...

302
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:56,470
Don't you have something to do before you start worrying about us?

303
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:00,310
Both you and Alphonse need to return to your bodies.

304
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:05,110
I'm sure a lot of people are waiting for the day you reach your goal.

305
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:08,570
Yeah.

306
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,320
I'll definitely get my body back. Together with Al.

307
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,620
Thanks for letting us stay, Dr. Nox.

308
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:19,000
Umm... Mister Armor?

309
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,750
Really, thank you for everything.

310
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,380
I have a name, you know. It's Alphonse Elric.

311
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,880
Elric?

312
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,840
You remember Edward Elric, right?

313
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,720
That small alchemist.

314
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,680
I'm his younger brother.

315
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,060
I lost my body due to certain circumstances, though...

316
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,810
If you're that guy's younger brother...

317
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,850
...does this mean you look just like him?

318
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:44,600
How rude!

319
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,360
I'm much taller than him!

320
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,200
My face isn't that stern, and I'm much stronger than him!

321
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,950
But I'm not short-tempered, either.

322
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,200
I'm a gentleman!

323
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:59,080
Sir Alphonse!!

324
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,830
I hope you get your body back soon!

325
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,170
Yeah. I hope so, too.

326
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:17,350
Megurimeguttemo mata koko de aitai

327
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:17,350
Even if we part and meet again, I want to meet at this place.

328
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:24,280
Then we'll hold hands to ensure we'll never be separated again.

329
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:24,280
Hagurenaiyouni kono te wo tsunagunda

330
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,910
We used to talk all night until the sun rose,

331
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,910
Asahi ga noboru made katariattane

332
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,740
And held hands till the sun went under the horizon.

333
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,740
Yuuhi ga shizumu made tsunaida te

334
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,990
Let's walk together like this forever, like light and shadow.

335
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,990
Kouyatte asu mo asatte mo tomo ni ayumou hikari to kage

336
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:39,540
I stand in the city, staring off into space with lonely eyes.

337
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:39,540
Samishige ni mitsumeru machi no naka de

338
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:44,880
I can't find warmth on my own.

339
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:44,880
Nukumori wa hitori ja mitsukaranakute

340
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,390
By meeting you, I realized

341
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,390
Ai ga konnani tsuyosa ni narukoto

342
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:56,220
How much strength love could give me.

343
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:56,220
Shittanda kimi ni deaete hajimete

344
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:01,480
Even if we part and meet again, I want to meet at this place.

345
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:01,480
Megurimeguttemo mata koko de aitai

346
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,780
Then we'll hold hands to ensure we'll never be separated again.

347
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,780
Hagurenaiyouni kono te wo tsunagunda

348
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:11,990
I can't sleep by myself, 'cause I can't dream without you.

349
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:11,990
Hitori ja nemurenai yume wa mirenaikara

350
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:17,750
So take me to a place where uncertainty can't reach us

351
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:17,750
Donna fuan mo todokanai tokoro e

352
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:23,000
And let us bring light to the night sky with no stars.

353
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:23,000
Hoshi no yoru mo terashitsuzukeyou

354
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,500
So long as you're with me, I can go to world's end.

355
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,500
Doko made mo yukeru kimi to nara

356
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,510
Even if it's a path I can't walk on my own,

357
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,510
Hitori ja arukenai michi mo futari nara

358
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:31,550
If you're by my side, I can walk it while humming a tune.

359
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:31,550
Hanauta utainagara arukerunda

360
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,970
If we're together, the world is mine.

361
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,970
Kimi ga ireba shiawase

362
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,930
Dr. Marcoh, I've brought your meal.

363
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:45,270
Huh? It's awfully quiet in here.

364
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,020
Could it be you're crying again, reminiscing about Ishbal?

365
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:01,390
The White Devil has been released into the wild.

366
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:04,520
The new fight begins now.

367
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,810
But the boy will not flinch.

368
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:10,690
He gets up and walks again, with hope as his landmark.

369
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:15,650
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

370
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:20,410
The 520 Cens Promise

371
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:20,410
Episode 31, The 520 Cens Promise.

372
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:25,450
The world which can only be understood by the ones who fought together is right in front of us.
