1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,020
Don't you desire freedom and rights, Hohenheim?

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,240
Do you plan to let your life end as a slave,

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,360
without even obtaining your basic rights as a human?

4
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,450
If so, you might as well be living in this stuffy flask.

5
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,270
The Other Side
of the Gateway

6
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,930
Why?!

7
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,220
All right!

8
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,550
Finish him, Ed!

9
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,970
Why am I, someone who has obtained God,

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,810
being defeated by the bare hands...

11
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,270
...of a mere human alchemist?

12
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,910
He did it!

13
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:58,660
All right!

14
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,240
You showed him!

15
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,730
Man the fuck up!

16
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,230
Why are you getting swept away?!

17
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,650
M-My bad!

18
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,270
Stone...

19
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,570
Philosopher's stone!!

20
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,580
Give me your philosopher's stone!

21
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,830
Shit!

22
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,330
Greed!!

23
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,670
Idiot, you're going to get yourself dragged in!

24
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,500
Let go!

25
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,840
I refuse!

26
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,800
In order for me to become the Emperor, I need you!

27
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,090
That's just impossible!

28
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:01,050
I was born from Father to begin with.

29
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,220
The force that's pulling me toward him is stronger than the one pulling me toward Lin Yao!

30
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,680
Nothing can be done!

31
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,480
Don't give up, Greed!

32
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,560
Keep trying!

33
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,690
Shit!

34
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,690
My body...!

35
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,570
God dammit!!

36
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,160
Well, it's a few ranks lower than being the king of the world,

37
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,410
but I guess I wouldn't mind becoming the Emperor of Xing.

38
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,790
We're gonna fight together, partner.

39
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,790
That's the spirit!

40
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,670
What are you...

41
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,380
And this is goodbye.

42
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,180
There's no need for you to be absorbed by him along with me.

43
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,730
H-Hang on, Greed!

44
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,520
You just said that we were going to fight together!

45
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,320
This is foul play, dammit!

46
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,190
I thought you never told lies!

47
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,740
You can't let it end like this!

48
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,950
You totally fell for it though, shitty brat!

49
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,460
That was my first and final lie.

50
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,960
Lan Fan has a philosopher's stone with her.

51
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,670
Take it home with you, kid.

52
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,210
Wait...

53
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:19,970
Wait!

54
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,470
Wait, Greed!!

55
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,430
Come, Lan Fan!

56
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,640
Peace.

57
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,060
Greed!

58
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,440
Greed!!

59
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,990
Curse you, Greed!!

60
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,450
I was able to free myself from an annoying brat.

61
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:56,090
Why do you revolt against your father, Greed?!

62
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,380
Just going through a late puberty, pops.

63
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,300
With this carbonization ability you gave me,

64
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,810
I'll turn us into the most brittle form of carbon, charcoal!

65
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,520
You little...!

66
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,810
Begone, fool!

67
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,980
Greed!!

68
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,320
Damn, I guess this is it...

69
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,040
Take a look in the damn mirror, brat.

70
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,880
Friends are connected by the soul!

71
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,090
There's no way you'd forget!

72
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,470
Want to join us?

73
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,060
If you've got nowhere else to go, come with us.

74
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:56,560
Man, both Lin and the midget totally made a fool out of me.

75
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,820
That was plenty...

76
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,780
Yeah, that was enough for me...

77
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,070
I don't need anything else...

78
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,830
Peace out, soul... brothers...

79
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,940
You guys...

80
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,450
My stones...

81
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,870
My philosopher's stones...

82
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,130
W-What?

83
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,920
What is this?!

84
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,970
Go back to where you were born,

85
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,890
Dwarf in the Flask, Homunculus!

86
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,360
Why?!

87
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,860
I wanted to learn everything about this world!

88
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,410
I wanted to live freely in this vast world without being bound by anyone!

89
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,330
I...!

90
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,590
Why?!

91
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,260
Why won't you become mine?!

92
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,390
God, what are you unhappy with?!

93
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:57,140
Because you don't believe in yourself.

94
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:05,020
You were born from humans after stealing other's power,

95
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,900
and yet, you were just clinging on to God the entire time.

96
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,740
You haven't grown up at all.

97
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:16,540
Did you think you'd be able to surpass humans if you let go of your seven desires?

98
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,200
Don't make me laugh!

99
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,830
I wanted to become a perfect being!

100
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,250
I wanted to learn everything about this world!

101
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,500
What's wrong with wanting that?!

102
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,420
What's wrong with desiring it?!

103
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,180
What's wrong with wishing for it?!

104
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,220
Who...

105
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,720
Who the hell are you?!

106
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,640
Who?!

107
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,770
Who the hell do you think you are?!

108
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:49,860
I'm the existence which you all refer to as "The World."

109
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,200
And "Universe," and "God,"

110
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,120
and "Truth," and "All," and "One."

111
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,160
And I am also yourself.

112
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:07,630
Truth is what gives one the most fitting form of despair to insure them not to become conceited.

113
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,630
He gives humans the most fitting form of despair to make sure humans don't become conceited.

114
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,890
That is Truth.

115
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,350
Thus, I'll also give you despair.

116
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,740
I don't want to go back!

117
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,070
No!

118
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,740
Stop! I don't want to be bound there forever!

119
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,920
No! No!

120
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,840
No!!

121
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,130
Despair to the ones who become swelled with pride.

122
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,630
What else should I have done?!

123
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,390
This is the end you desired.

124
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,720
What should I have done?!

125
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,650
You probably foresaw the answer.

126
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,870
What? What happened?

127
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,250
Did we win?

128
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,040
Yes.

129
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:30,000
But... Alphonse has yet to come back from the other side.

130
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,710
I'm... I'm so sorry...!

131
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,800
It's not your fault.

132
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,180
It was Al's decision.

133
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,350
Ed, we have a toll.

134
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,770
Use it, it's a philosopher's stone.

135
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,810
Use this to get Al back.

136
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,770
I can't.

137
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:56,950
We promised we'd never use a philosopher's stone to get our bodies back.

138
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,040
There has to be another way.

139
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,620
There HAS to be.

140
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,920
Think...!

141
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,380
Think!

142
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,960
Don't stop thinking!

143
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,010
Edward.

144
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,350
Use my life to bring Alphonse back.

145
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,060
I've got just enough life left for one.

146
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,270
Idiot!

147
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,980
There's no way I could do something like that!

148
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,320
It's our own fault that we lost our bodies!

149
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,320
I've said so many times that we won't use other's lives to get Al back!

150
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,410
Besides, why the hell do YOU have to give your life up?!

151
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,990
Because I'm your father.

152
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,000
It's not about needs or reasoning.

153
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,620
You two are precious to me.

154
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,000
I want the both of you to live happily.

155
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:59,510
I'm partially to blame for what happened to your bodies, since I left you to care for yourselves.

156
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,180
I'm sorry.

157
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,770
I've lived enough.

158
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:12,020
Let me do something father-like for just this last time.

159
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,280
Don't be ridiculous, you good-for-nothing dad!

160
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,570
Don't ever say something like that again!

161
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,530
I'll punch you!

162
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,340
I'm sorry, Edward...

163
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,270
Think...!

164
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,640
Think!

165
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,900
Aren't I supposed to be the youngest state alchemist of all time?!

166
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:59,070
I can use alchemy without a transmutation circle because I saw Truth, right?!

167
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,070
There has to be a way!

168
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,400
There has to be!

169
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:14,080
I'm sure a lot of people are waiting for the day when you two get your bodies back.

170
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:18,090
If there's a possibility, you should move forward.

171
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:22,340
That's right. Don't give up.

172
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,220
There... There has to be something.

173
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,970
Something!

174
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,570
Sir Al...

175
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,240
Sir Al...!

176
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,450
Sir Al!

177
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,160
May is crying so much for Al...

178
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,960
Zampano, Donkey Kong, and everyone from Briggs...

179
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:06,340
Major, Lin, Lan Fan...

180
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,850
Master, Dad...

181
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,320
May, step away for a sec.

182
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,760
That's...!

183
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:53,810
A human transmutation circle!

184
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,770
I'll be right back.

185
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,480
The last transmutation that the Fullmetal Alchemist will ever do.

186
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,120
Ed!

187
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,240
Ed!

188
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,490
Edward Elric!

189
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,140
So you came to get your brother back.

190
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,310
But how are you going to drag an entire human out?

191
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,850
What will you sacrifice?

192
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,150
Your entire body?

193
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:47,030
There's something huge right here that I can sacrifice.

194
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,290
This is MY Gate of Truth.

195
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:59,540
Which means I can do whatever I want with it.

196
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,040
Am I wrong?

197
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,050
So that was your plan.

198
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
But are you sure about that?

199
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:16,720
If you lose your Gate of Truth,
you'll never be able to use alchemy again.

200
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,060
Yeah...

201
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,610
You're right, all of alchemy is on the other side of this gate.

202
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:28,320
But thanks to it, I was manipulated.

203
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:34,780
I was shown the Truth, and believed that I could solve everything with alchemy.

204
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,910
But I was wrong.

205
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,330
I was just being arrogant.

206
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:44,840
You're going to become an ordinary human who can't use alchemy?

207
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:49,380
I'm not going to "become" anything. I've always been an ordinary human.

208
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:55,010
I'm a puny human who couldn't even save a girl who was turned into a chimera.

209
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:59,350
So you're sure you don't mind getting rid of that?

210
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,310
Ed!

211
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,060
Fullmetal!

212
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,020
Edward!

213
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:02,560
Ed!

214
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,980
Edward Elric!

215
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,560
Ed!

216
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,440
Mr. Edward!

217
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,150
Ed!

218
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,770
Ed!

219
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,610
Even if I lose alchemy, I'll still have my friends.

220
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,120
Correct, alchemist!

221
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,370
You've defeated me.

222
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,000
Take everything you want!

223
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,000
The back door is over that way,

224
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,380
Edward Elric.

225
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,020
You were so reckless.

226
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,270
Ditto.

227
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,410
Okay, let's go back. Together.

228
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,280
Yeah.

229
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,680
Hey, he's awake!

230
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,550
You okay, Alphonse?

231
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,220
Mr. Zampano and Mr. Darius...

232
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,270
Everyone...

233
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,730
Dad!

234
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,730
Yo, welcome back.

235
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,190
Yup.

236
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,570
Glad to be back.

237
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,950
So warm...

238
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,450
Sir Al...

239
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,830
Sir Alphonse!

240
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,950
May!

241
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,960
I... I...!

242
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,130
That's right, I'm sorry.

243
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,960
I made you do something you didn't want to do.

244
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,720
Thanks, May.

245
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,470
To those who are listening to Radio Capital:

246
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:06,480
Today, the squadrons led by Major General Armstrong and Colonel Mustang

247
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,190
captured Central Headquarters, assembly, and so on.

248
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:13,980
This was all in order to halt the actions of the upper echelon of the army;

249
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:19,240
they were planning a massive alchemy experiment that would sacrifice a great number of our citizens.

250
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,870
Out of the masterminds who were planning on carrying out this evil experiment,

251
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,620
Brigadier General Clemin and Brigadier General Edison were captured,

252
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,630
and the soldiers who used to be under their command were disarmed.

253
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,050
Führer President King Bradley and his son, Selim,

254
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,430
lost their lives in the midst of the confusion.

255
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:49,440
Colonel Mustang has voiced his intention to carry on the will of the Führer President and to keep our nation safe,

256
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,110
and that he'll consult with all whom it may concern about future measures.

257
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,160
You're the one who gave me blood, right?

258
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,870
Don't you desire freedom and rights, Hohenheim?

259
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,830
Then what does happiness mean to you?

260
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,840
Let's see... I won't ask for anything too extravagant,

261
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:21,130
but I guess I'd be happy if I could somehow leave this flask.

262
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:29,350
You're right, Dwarf in the Flask, Homunculus.

263
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:34,480
You were born from my blood.

264
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,860
I...

265
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,910
Sir Hohenheim.

266
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,910
Both of your children have been safely hospitalized.

267
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,250
Thank you. I appreciate it.

268
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,500
No, I should be the one thanking you.

269
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:02,010
Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric.

270
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:06,470
If it weren't for those two boys, this country would have fallen.

271
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,020
Thank you very much.

272
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:16,770
Thanks.

273
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,070
I'm home, Trisha.

274
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,580
Edward called me "Dad."

275
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,620
Though there was a "good-for-nothing" in front of it.

276
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:26,340
I always thought that it would be backbreaking to continue living longer than everyone else.

277
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:30,220
But by meeting you and our sons,

278
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,350
I was able to truly appreciate the fact that I was alive, from the bottom of my heart.

279
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,480
It was a fulfilling life.

280
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:42,150
Yeah... it was more than enough.

281
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,070
Thank you, Trisha.

282
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,120
But...

283
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:56,750
...somehow, I still want to live.

284
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,590
I really am a good-for-nothing.

285
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,100
Hohenheim!

286
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,720
What, you came home?

287
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,270
Idiot...

288
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:27,030
I've never seen a dead person look so happy.

289
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:33,870
The new morning we've finally found

290
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:33,870
Yatto mitsuketa atarashii asa wa

291
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:38,250
is being hampered by the past.

292
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:38,250
Tsukihi ga jama wo suru

293
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,710
What we chased after wasn't the future,

294
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,710
Mukau saki wa tsugi ja nakute

295
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:47,550
but the past so full of remorse.

296
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:47,550
Sugi bakari oikaketa

297
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,930
The ruthless memories won't stop playing;

298
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,930
Nariyamanai yousha nai omoide tachi wa

299
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:58,100
they won't be forgiving us for a long time.

300
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:58,100
Yurushite kuresou nimonai

301
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,230
It's about now that a teardrop

302
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,230
Sorosoro kana tesaguri tsukareta hoho wo

303
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:08,900
beings to roll down my fatigued cheeks.

304
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:08,900
Kattou ga koboreochiru

305
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:13,950
Will this rain ever stop?

306
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:13,950
Ame wa itsuka yamunodeshouka

307
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:19,040
I've been freezing for a long time.

308
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:19,040
Zuibun nagai aida tsumetai

309
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:24,130
Why does the rain continue to fix on me?

310
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:24,130
Ame wa doushite boku wo erabuno

311
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:29,130
I wonder if it could embrace me.

312
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:29,130
Tsutsumarete iikana

313
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:33,890
Today, the rain falls again;

314
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:33,890
Ame wa yamu koto wo shirazuni

315
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:39,100
endlessly it falls knowing no end.

316
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:39,100
Kyou mo furitsuzukukeredo

317
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:44,190
We nestle close to each other to share the warmth

318
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:44,190
Sotto sashidashita kasa no naka de

319
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:52,910
under this umbrella, you gently held out to me.

320
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:52,910
Nukumori ni yorisoinagara

321
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:05,040
The beginning is what comes after the ending.

322
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:10,660
Carve out with your own hands a future, filled with hope.

323
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,930
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

324
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:20,080
Finale, Journey's End.

325
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:20,080
Journey's End

326
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,770
Take a step forward into the world called "life."
