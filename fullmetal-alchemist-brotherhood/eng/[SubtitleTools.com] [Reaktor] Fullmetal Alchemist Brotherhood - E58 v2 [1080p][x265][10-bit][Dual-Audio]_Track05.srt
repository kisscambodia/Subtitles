1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,150
The new morning we've finally found

2
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,150
Yatto mitsuketa atarashii asa wa

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,190
is being hampered by the past.

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,190
Tsukihi ga jama wo suru

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,660
What we chased after wasn't the future,

6
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,660
Mukau saki wa tsugi ja nakute

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,490
but the past so full of remorse.

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,490
Sugi bakari oikaketa

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,960
The ruthless memories won't stop playing;

10
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,960
Nariyamanai yousha nai omoide tachi wa

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,050
they won't be forgiving us for a long time.

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,050
Yurushite kuresou nimonai

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,890
It's about now that a teardrop

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,890
Sorosoro kana tesaguri tsukareta hoho wo

15
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,560
beings to roll down my fatigued cheeks.

16
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,560
Kattou ga koboreochiru

17
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,810
Will this rain ever stop?

18
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,810
Ame wa itsuka yamunodeshouka

19
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:52,030
I've been freezing for a long time.

20
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:52,030
Zuibun nagai aida tsumetai

21
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,320
Ame wa doushite boku wo erabuno

22
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,320
Why does the rain continue to fix on me?

23
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,080
I wonder if it could embrace me.

24
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,080
Tsutsumarete iikana

25
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,870
Today, the rain falls again;

26
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,870
Ame wa yamu koto wo shirazuni

27
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,090
endlessly it falls knowing no end.

28
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,090
Kyou mo furitsuzukukeredo

29
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,130
We nestle close to each other to share the warmth

30
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,130
Sotto sashidashita kasa no naka de

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:28,850
Nukumori ni yorisoinagara

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:28,850
under this umbrella, you gently held out to me.

33
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:33,900
Fullmetal!

34
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,990
He disappeared?!

35
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,780
What did you do?!

36
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,840
He was simply escorted to a place
you'll eventually arrive at yourself.

37
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,600
What the hell is this?

38
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,390
This sensation...

39
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,100
That's right!

40
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,980
The same sensation I got when I opened the Gate of Truth!

41
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,380
Sacrifices

42
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,490
Dammit!

43
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,240
You son of a bitch!

44
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,220
You're...!

45
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,310
Idiot!

46
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,600
Leave this place to us!

47
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,730
It's our duty...

48
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,110
...to protect the young master.

49
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,280
It's impossible to carry this much weight with an automail!

50
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,320
Worry about your grandfather instead!

51
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:46,870
It's...

52
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,160
...too late.

53
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,580
Briggs soldiers, lend me a hand!

54
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,170
Right!

55
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,760
Bradley, eat this!

56
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,020
Fu!

57
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,530
Fu!!

58
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,450
Someone call a doctor!

59
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,750
Are there any doctors well-versed in alchemy?!

60
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,910
I've...

61
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,500
I've got a philosopher's stone right here!

62
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,130
Use as much of it as you need!

63
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,050
Anyone!

64
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,260
Please!

65
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,180
Isn't Amestris the land of alchemy?!

66
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,300
There's gotta be someone here!

67
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:46,890
Hey!!

68
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,140
Why...?

69
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:58,900
Why...

70
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,610
Young master!

71
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,040
You monster...

72
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:16,920
Why...

73
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,960
I can't save a single vassal despite achieving immortality...?

74
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,090
Fuck!!

75
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,260
Captain!

76
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,020
Captain, get yourself together!

77
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,480
Captain!

78
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,520
Captain!!

79
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,650
Captain!!

80
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,060
Fire!

81
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,540
We were able to give Bradley a fatal wound thanks to you.

82
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,370
Even though you ensured that Fu's death would not be in vain,

83
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,130
I can't even do a thing to help you.

84
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,590
Give me ammo!

85
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,180
That was the last round!

86
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,810
Shit!

87
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,140
I'm out too!

88
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,310
Everyone, fire back with your rifles!

89
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,230
Roger!

90
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,250
Lin Yao...

91
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,960
Or Greed, whichever you are...

92
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:46,460
If you're truly thankful, would you mind doing me a favor?

93
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:54,470
We're not supposed to let this gate open until our Queen orders it to be.

94
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,480
Please, protect it...

95
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:06,530
It should be possible with your strength...

96
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,030
No, only you... can do it...

97
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,410
I'm begging you...

98
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,480
Greed.

99
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,190
Yo?

100
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,770
I want power.

101
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,650
Lend me some.

102
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,860
Sure thing.

103
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,780
We've still got some time until my next plan.

104
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,160
Lan Fan, you protect the people here.

105
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,160
Roger!

106
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,580
Could you... do that for me?

107
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,090
Yeah, I promise.

108
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,550
People from Xing...

109
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,010
...never break alliances!

110
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,270
Fire! Fire!

111
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,790
W-Who the hell is that?!

112
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,450
All right, listen up!

113
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,830
Those who don't wish to get hurt,

114
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,790
and those who have family and lovers, stand back!

115
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,010
And women, too!

116
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,720
I don't particularly enjoy fighting women!

117
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,820
No way...!

118
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,880
Fire!!

119
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,440
Incredible...

120
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,400
Lin Yao.

121
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,950
Or should I say, Homunculus?

122
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,970
How promising they are once you have one on your side...

123
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,510
Captain!

124
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,760
Captain!

125
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,650
Captain, please hang in there!

126
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:15,320
Did he... join our side?

127
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,110
Yes, sir!

128
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,570
Now I can kick the bucket in peace...

129
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,610
What are you saying, Captain?!

130
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,700
Major General Armstrong will achieve victory soon!

131
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,080
Just a little longer!

132
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:31,580
We need you to take an even more active role in Central than ever before!

133
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:41,760
I don't like the sooty sky here in Central...

134
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,220
Farewell, comrades...

135
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,770
I'll go on ahead...

136
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,320
...to an even higher place than the summit of Briggs...

137
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,660
Captain Buccaneer!!!

138
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,620
What was that flash of light from before?

139
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,210
There hasn't been a single announcement.

140
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:16,460
What's going on with military headquarters?

141
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,670
No follow-up reports from Radio Capital?

142
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,470
Nope.

143
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,010
What about the other stations?

144
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,350
They're just announcing a curfew for the moment.

145
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,270
Mommy!

146
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:37,060
The radio tells us we can't go outside,

147
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,400
so let's hold off on going to Tabasa's house today, okay, Elicia?

148
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,780
What?!

149
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,200
We can see the solar eclipse from here, too.

150
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
It's about to begin,

151
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,790
so let's watch it from here with Mommy.

152
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,090
Izumi!

153
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,220
Where are you?!

154
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,590
Izumi!!

155
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,350
Alex, do you know what just happened?

156
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,850
I heard this from the Elric Brothers in the past.

157
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,020
They said that when they performed human transmutation,

158
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,860
they were dragged into the Gate of Truth by black hands.

159
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,990
What is this "Gate of Truth" you speak of?

160
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,080
I have no idea.

161
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,290
What did you say?!

162
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,410
Were you able to get in touch with them?

163
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,370
Major General, headquarters is safe.

164
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,460
Good.

165
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,960
And, did you obtain any information pertaining to Miss Izumi's situation?

166
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,720
No...

167
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,340
I see...

168
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,510
And what else?

169
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,270
During a battle with King Bradley,

170
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:59,900
Captain Buccaneer, who was defending the main gate,

171
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,400
lost his life along with a few other men.

172
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,910
It has been reported that the captain,
working together with someone from Xing,

173
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,540
successfully gave Bradley a fatal wound and knocked him down into a canal.

174
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,200
Impossible!

175
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,170
There's no way that can be true!

176
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:23,460
How could that King Bradley die so easily?!

177
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,920
He's not human-

178
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,140
And what about the main gate?

179
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,350
It's still being defended.

180
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,140
A homunculus by the name of Greed joined their side,

181
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,350
and tore apart the central soldiers at the main gate.

182
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,940
A homunculus?!

183
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,650
Impossible.

184
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,530
A homunculus would never turn its fangs on that man...

185
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:49,780
Apparently, Captain Buccaneer passed away with a smile.

186
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,280
I see.

187
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,250
If he died with a smile, we can't sit here and weep.

188
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,540
Let's proceed!

189
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,290
Roger!

190
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:04,960
Let's go, Mr. Sig.

191
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,050
We also need to look for your wife.

192
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,300
Right.

193
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,450
Ouch...

194
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:32,990
Oww...

195
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,780
Master!

196
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,000
Ed!

197
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,040
Are you okay?!

198
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,870
Yeah, somewhat.

199
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,540
What are you doing here?

200
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,920
That's what I want to know.

201
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,420
So, where are we?

202
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,800
I don't know.

203
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,680
I was just sent here all of a sudden...

204
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,270
Al!

205
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:01,230
Al!

206
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,140
Hey!

207
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,140
Even Al?

208
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:02,690
Get yourself together!

209
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,270
Could it be that all the human sacrifices were gathered?

210
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,770
What's wrong, Al?!

211
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:05,980
Hey!

212
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:12,070
One, two, three...

213
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,280
...and four.

214
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,290
We're missing one.

215
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:26,330
I guess the last one is currently being made.

216
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:30,260
W-What the hell is this monster?

217
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,010
Hohenheim!

218
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,470
Edward...

219
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,430
Even Alphonse was captured...?

220
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,600
Whoa, Miss Izumi as well.

221
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,390
Sorry I'm in such a pitiful state.

222
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,100
What in the world is going on?

223
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,820
Well...

224
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,030
You stay put.

225
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:57,450
I'll slowly absorb the philosopher's stone inside you later.

226
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:01,040
Who the hell is that dark guy, Hohenheim?!

227
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,620
My alter ego.

228
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,790
The guy who the homunculi called 'Father'.

229
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,010
That's the geezer?!

230
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,220
Yeah.

231
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,590
I was able to destroy his skin, but...

232
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,770
Quit your blabbering, Hohenheim.

233
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:28,980
I welcome you, human sacrifices.

234
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,990
Thanks for coming to my castle.

235
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,070
Al, wake up.

236
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,080
This one's going to be tough.

237
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,540
Al?

238
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,910
Hey, Al!

239
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,870
Alphonse!

240
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,170
The ones up there are so unreliable.

241
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,800
They couldn't even prepare five human sacrifices for this day?

242
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:07,600
Well, I gathered all the ones who've been seeking morsels like immortality,

243
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,980
so it's no surprise that they couldn't do their jobs.

244
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,780
Damn you!

245
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,170
Excellent. Stay just like that.

246
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:42,720
Now, Mustang, we don't have much time.

247
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,850
I'd appreciate it if you could willingly cooperate with me.

248
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:51,270
Do you mind performing human transmutation and opening the gate?

249
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,440
What?

250
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,980
I don't care who you transmutate.

251
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,070
Your late parents, your lover, your friend.

252
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,910
The one you were close to...

253
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,040
What was his name again?

254
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,990
Hughes.

255
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,750
I don't mind if you transmutate him.

256
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,750
We'll take care of all the arrangements.

257
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,750
The ones you call... "human sacrifices"?

258
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,460
Precisely.

259
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,050
Those who open the gate can become human sacrifices.

260
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,760
So that's why the Elric Brothers were chosen.

261
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,220
Yup.

262
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,520
I heard from them that human transmutation doesn't work.

263
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,610
What idiot would try it when they know it's not going to work?!

264
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,360
Good point there.

265
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,740
So as long as you open the gate and come back, it's fine.

266
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,820
I refuse!

267
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,700
I won't perform human transmutation!

268
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,950
I won't open the gate either!

269
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:54,210
Didn't I tell you that we don't have much time?

270
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,760
Lieutenant!

271
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,430
Lieutenant?!

272
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,350
Lieutenant!

273
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:10,930
Now, open the gate, Mustang.

274
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,600
You scum!!

275
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,440
Lieutenant! Can you hear me?!

276
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,730
Say something!

277
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:22,570
Now, perform human transmutation and become the fifth sacrifice.

278
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:30,040
Come on, if you don't pick up the pace, this woman will die.

279
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,710
Oh, I get it.

280
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,960
You're going to transmute her back after she dies?

281
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,840
That's fine too.

282
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,300
I won't die...

283
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:48,680
I've been ordered not to die...

284
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:52,730
If one could obtain an immortal body with an order like that,

285
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,230
everyone would live without worry.

286
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,610
What will you do, Mustang?

287
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:03,030
A woman who's precious to you is dying.

288
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,780
If you leave her be, she'll die from blood loss.

289
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:11,830
But I'm a doctor well-versed in alchemy,

290
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:15,210
and tadaa, I even have a philosopher's stone.

291
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:24,130
In other words, I can save this woman's life.

292
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:33,430
Well, if she dies before you make a decision, there'll be nothing I can do.

293
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,020
Oh?

294
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,650
She's gotten quiet.

295
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,690
I wonder if she died.

296
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,450
Colonel...

297
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:54,620
There's no need... for you to perform human transmutation.

298
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,420
You'll do it, won't you, Mustang?

299
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,970
Now!

300
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,070
I will.

301
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,800
Ever since that day passed,

302
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,800
Ano hi kara zutto

303
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,050
I promised myself that I'd never cry.

304
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,050
Nakanaito kimetekitakedo

305
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:51,600
But even while I hoarded up the pain,

306
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:51,600
Itami wo kasanetemo

307
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,710
there was something I couldn't forgive myself for.

308
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,710
Nanika wo yurusezu ni ita

309
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,150
I'll never be able

310
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,150
Mou modorenai

311
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,650
to return to those days.

312
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,650
Ikutsumo no hibi

313
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:07,740
I'm still powerless.

314
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:07,740
Boku wa mada nanimo dekizuni

315
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:12,990
I watch as the shards of memories disappear, one by one;

316
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:12,990
Kimi no ita kioku no kakera

317
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:18,860
memories of when you were still with me.

318
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:18,860
Mata hitotsu kieteyuku

319
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,880
I long to become

320
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,880
Kyou yori motto

321
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,630
stronger than I am now,

322
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,630
Tsuyoku naritai

323
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:29,770
so that my voice will eventually reach you.

324
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:29,770
Kono koe ga itsuka todokuyouni

325
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,140
If the wind happens to stop

326
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,140
Arukitsuzukete

327
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,850
in the midst of my long journey,

328
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,850
Kaze ga yandara

329
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:39,560
I'll look up at the sky in search of you.

330
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:39,560
Kimi wo sagashite sora miageruyo

331
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:46,900
Yoake no saki ni hikari ga sasuyo

332
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:46,900
Beyond the daybreak, a ray of light breaks free.

333
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:52,450
A rainbow spans across the sky.

334
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:52,450
Niji ga kakaruyo

335
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:01,960
Though there may be favorable turn,

336
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,540
know that this repose last but a moment.

337
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:11,130
The place upon which thou standest is the entrance to the netherworld.

338
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:16,640
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
