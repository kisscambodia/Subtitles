1
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:23,460
We sigh whenever we're about to come to a standstill

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:23,460
Owarinaki tabi no tochuu tachidomarisouna toki

3
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,710
While moving on this endless journey.

4
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,710
Fukai tameiki kobosu bokura wa

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,430
Everytime we lunge for it, it escapes and flies off.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,430
Tsukamikaketewa mata hanareteitta

7
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,850
But now, there's nothing to be afraid of

8
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,850
Demo ima wa mou nanimo osoreru koto wa nai

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,780
The powerful ties that bind our hearts

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,780
Kokoro wo tsunagu tsuyoi kizuna wa

11
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,240
Keshite hodoke wa shinai sa

12
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,240
Will never come loose.

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,960
After a lifetime of searching, we finally arrived

14
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,960
Sagashitsuzukete tadoritsuita

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,760
Here, where the period lies.

16
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,760
Kono basho de piriodo ni

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:23,060
Let's change all our sorrow and rage to power.

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:23,060
Kanashimi ikari chikara ni kaete

19
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,980
Destiny is right within our reach.

20
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,980
Unmei wa sugu soba ni

21
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,360
Along with the recovered Lan Fan,

22
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,570
Ed engages in combat with the Homunculus Pride.

23
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,580
He works out a plan while his mettle is tested,

24
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,450
and successfully retrieves Al.

25
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:50,250
But Pride swallows Gluttony, a comrade of his,

26
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,500
and obtains his abilities.

27
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,880
Elsewhere, Mustang has reunited with Hawkeye and his men.

28
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,970
They've kidnapped the Führer President's wife in order to hold her hostage.

29
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,040
Filial Affection

30
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,480
Wake up, Al.

31
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,320
Hey, Al!

32
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,570
Can you hear me?

33
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,070
Alphonse!

34
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,360
This scent...

35
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,700
Edward Elric.

36
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,500
I'm sure Hohenheim will have no choice but to show himself if I were to capture you.

37
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,270
Ed!

38
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,700
Young master!

39
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,040
Sorry,

40
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,660
it's Greed now.

41
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,830
You scum...

42
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,460
Give young master back his body!

43
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,710
No can do.

44
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:16,800
Here he comes!

45
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:25,550
Are you okay?!

46
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,690
I don't need your help!

47
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:36,770
Shut up!

48
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,280
Your arm hasn't even fully recovered yet, right?!

49
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,490
So what?!

50
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,740
Just worry about yourself for now.

51
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,910
I'm going to need your help later, you know.

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,420
Keep going!

53
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,670
Sorry, I couldn't finish him.

54
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,880
Heh, don't worry about it.

55
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,380
I can't blame you for not being able to beat him.

56
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,630
Even from my perspective, he's a monster.

57
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:11,770
Wake up!

58
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:13,940
Alphonse!

59
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,940
Huh?

60
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,110
Dad?

61
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,610
Yo.

62
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,490
So...

63
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,330
If you're here...

64
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,740
Am I in Kanama?

65
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,740
Yup.

66
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,790
Why am I...

67
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,210
Since when...

68
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,000
I remember now! Pride!

69
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,460
Dad, the Homunculus Pride is inside me!

70
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,550
Yeah, I heard everything from Mr. Gorrilius.

71
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,630
It's Darius.

72
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,550
Drats...

73
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,560
It felt so disgusting. It was as if he was interfering with my soul.

74
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:56,900
They're like the alter ego of my alter ego.

75
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,820
Since you're my son, it's probably easier for them to interfere with your soul through the blood seal.

76
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,450
Old Man Fu!

77
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,000
Please treat his injuries.

78
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,500
How are things going over there?

79
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,380
Are you Edward's father?

80
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,420
Yeah.

81
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,970
The shadowy monster devoured Gluttony, and we hardly stand a chance.

82
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:31,810
Greed and Edward are fighting him, but things aren't looking too good.

83
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,600
It's all my fault...

84
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,020
Everyone's in danger because I was captured by Pride...

85
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,690
There's an unlimited source of light due to the fire, and I've already used up all of my flash bangs.

86
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,570
We can't use that same trick again.

87
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,200
This isn't good.

88
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,620
At this rate, the people living in the slums will be dragged into it as well.

89
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,410
Dad.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,790
You're a skilled alchemist, right?

91
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,250
Of course.

92
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,800
You'd be amazed.

93
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,800
There's something I'd like to ask of you, considering your skill.

94
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,890
Well then...

95
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,230
The view is pretty clear now.

96
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,990
No use in taking cover.

97
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,950
You can't escape from my nose.

98
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:31,990
Dammit...!

99
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,830
Hey, you alive?!

100
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,540
More or less...

101
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:39,330
Should you really be worrying about others right now, Greed?

102
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,920
I wonder how much more you can take at this point.

103
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,420
You monster.

104
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,180
A rather rude way to address your sibling, don't you think?

105
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,430
Mind if I eat you?

106
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,180
Eat me and you'll have a stomachache, Big Bro.

107
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,730
Oh? Finally decided to show yourself?

108
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,610
Hohenheim.

109
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:10,150
Heroes are supposed to show up late.

110
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,820
Heroes?

111
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,780
So you think you're able to defeat me?

112
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,200
Nah, that's impossible.

113
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,210
You're pretty scary, after all.

114
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,090
What is he planning?

115
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,890
Is he aiming for something?

116
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,990
He's coming!

117
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,450
Wow, what a disappointing strategy.

118
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,290
You just don't know when to give up!

119
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,210
Al!

120
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,680
So he came back, just to be taken hostage again?

121
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,190
Your son is quite the odd one.

122
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,320
Don't you dare...

123
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,480
...to make fun of my son.

124
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:53,170
Hohenheim!!!

125
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,980
Amazing...!

126
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,520
He actually sealed him in.

127
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,370
What's the big idea?!

128
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,490
You got Al stuck in there too!

129
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,700
What the hell were you thinking?!

130
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,670
It wasn't my idea.

131
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,170
It was Al's.

132
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,800
It worked!

133
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,050
You can't use your ability in here.

134
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,390
Is that really a cause for celebration?

135
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,430
You can't escape either.

136
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,850
If you crack open an exit to leave even for an instant...

137
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,310
...I'll use my shadow and-

138
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,310
I don't have the slightest intention of getting out of here.

139
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,280
Why don't we engage in a test of wills, Selim?

140
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,150
No, Homunculus Pride.

141
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:00,700
My body doesn't require oxygen, light, or even food.

142
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,540
You're going to quietly sit here with me for the entire day,

143
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,960
until the Promised Day comes to an end.

144
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,710
Defeating Pride in his current state would be difficult.

145
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:16,920
And if we were to let him run loose,
it would cause massive damage to the surroundings.

146
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,720
That's why Al offered to use himself as a decoy to trap him without engaging in combat.

147
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:25,930
With this, we've gained some time to work out a plan.

148
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,060
But you guys didn't even discuss it with me-

149
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,560
He said,

150
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,860
"If I were to tell Brother, he'd definitely be against it."

151
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,740
He did the best he could to think of a way that would keep everyone alive.

152
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,030
Don't get mad at him.

153
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,620
Okay, let's start with putting this fire out.

154
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,670
Al!

155
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,420
Brother!

156
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,380
Al!

157
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,010
Sorry for doing this just after we were reunited.

158
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,810
But I had to, because I was the one who caused this mess.

159
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,270
And besides, I only have to be in here for a day.

160
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,610
I'll be fine, Brother.

161
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:25,780
Lust is gone, Envy is gone, and Gluttony now, too.

162
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,540
Wrath is at the the joint exercise in the east,

163
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,460
and Pride can't move right now.

164
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:38,250
The only ones left at Central right now are Father and Sloth.

165
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,510
Greed! What the hell are you thinking?!

166
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,010
Told you earlier, didn't I?

167
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,720
I'm going to become the king of the world.

168
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,610
Don't you think there's been a lot of Ishbalans in Central lately?

169
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,150
Yeah, man.

170
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:06,120
I heard there's a group of them near the abandoned building to the west.

171
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,950
Speaking of Ishbalans...

172
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,950
Remember the lad with the cross-shaped scar who used to live here?

173
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,040
I wonder how he's doing.

174
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,840
Yo, speak of the devil!

175
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,250
We were just talking about you!

176
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,510
I'm looking for a slum by the name of Kanama.

177
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:28,350
Kanama is located on the edge of town,
in the forest to the south.

178
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,350
I see. Thanks.

179
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,600
Oh yeah, isn't the little girl with you?

180
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:38,110
You know, the one who was
carrying around a black and white cat.

181
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,110
She actually came back here a little while ago.

182
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,990
What?!

183
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:44,490
She didn't go back to her country?

184
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,410
What is she up to?

185
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,290
You guys finally did it!

186
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,370
What are you talking about?

187
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,040
You guys were the ones behind it, right?

188
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,290
The ones who blew up Bradley in his train in the east.

189
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,000
Blew up?!

190
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,550
Huh? Was I wrong?

191
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,800
This is news to us.

192
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:07,760
Well, I figured you teamed up
with the other Ishbalans and did it.

193
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,470
Well, everyone was saying that
they were going to commit terrorism.

194
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:16,020
They didn't gather here to do such a thing.

195
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:21,770
They're good friends of ours who seek to change this country in a method other than terrorism.

196
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:45,630
I should stop being so enthusiastic about my work.

197
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:50,010
Because of that, I've soiled my new suit.

198
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,430
The real performance starts after daybreak.

199
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,530
It's useless.

200
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,280
There's no way my dad would make it so easy for a child to be able to break through.

201
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:19,170
This is what happens when you make fun of humans so much.

202
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:23,380
You guys don't know anything about us.

203
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,970
You shouldn't think that everything will go your way.

204
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,340
Same with that scheme.

205
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,640
From my perspective, it's just careless planning.

206
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,760
Careless?

207
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,430
That's right.

208
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,270
You call us human sacrifices,

209
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:42,480
and it seems as though you're planning on using us to accomplish something...

210
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,780
What if we were to escape outside the country for the fear of our own safety?

211
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,150
At that point, your plan would have been completely ruined.

212
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:58,250
As you say, there are humans who believe that their safety comes first.

213
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,290
However...

214
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,920
Yes, for example, Wrath's wife.

215
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:09,470
There once was a time when I was about to be hit by a car in town.

216
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:15,760
She tried to save me, ready to sacrifice her own life.

217
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:20,440
Though she doesn't know I'm a homunculus,

218
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,860
I was completely taken aback by her desperate action.

219
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,620
I've always had a father, but never a mother.

220
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,120
That's why, to be honest, her existence was fascinating.

221
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,330
I began to wonder whether that's what having a mother was like.

222
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,210
Wrath's wife...

223
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,790
Madam Bradley, right?

224
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,500
That's right.

225
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,800
I can't believe how low you are to deceive such a kind soul...

226
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,890
You're right. It was  as if we were playing a game of house.

227
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:01,930
But it was fun living with her,

228
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,480
and I do love her.

229
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,310
Then-

230
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,270
There are...

231
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:16,910
There are humans, like Wrath's wife, who would throw away their own life to protect something dear to them.

232
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,370
And those of you who were chosen to be human sacrifices,

233
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:25,580
possess a strong heart, even out of those people.

234
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:29,130
There's no way you'd throw away this country and flee.

235
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,800
For instance, you came back here to fight.

236
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,260
There's not a hint of carelessness in our plan.

237
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,490
Colonel.

238
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,700
It's almost time.

239
00:16:58,830 --> 00:16:59,660
Right.

240
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,790
Let's go, Lieutenant.

241
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,850
What in the name of...

242
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:29,400
What happened here?

243
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:32,480
And what is this mound?

244
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,110
Well, if it isn't Jerso and Zampano!

245
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,990
Darius!

246
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:44,370
D-Don't tell me Kimblee sent you here to eliminate us?

247
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,120
Huh?

248
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,580
What are you, high?

249
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,330
I stopped working for Kimblee months ago.

250
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,670
You're just saying that to get us off guard, and then you're planning to kill us!

251
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:53,760
I'm not!

252
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,800
I can't trust you!

253
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,510
Heinkel's probably hiding somewhere over there, ready to ambush us.

254
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,850
Quit being so insistent, idiot!

255
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,850
Doctor Marcoh!

256
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:01,970
What did you just call me?!

257
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,100
You want to fight, Porky Pig?!

258
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,100
Edward.

259
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,270
That's Zampano!

260
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:04,970
You-

261
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,980
So Scar was with you guys.

262
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:05,980
What are you saying?!

263
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,940
The gorilla said it!

264
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,270
Sorry to rush you when you just arrived, but we should make arrangements asap-

265
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,360
Hey!

266
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,070
Why can't pigs, fatties and gorillas learn to get along?!

267
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,820
Are you picking a fight, punk?!

268
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:24,950
Oh, so you guys really did stop working for Kimblee.

269
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:30,290
If we kept working for him, he'd just dispose of us.

270
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,830
Definitely.

271
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,510
Well thanks to that, we're fugitives now,

272
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,050
but it does feel nice.

273
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,220
Yeah.

274
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,970
Also,

275
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,680
those guys definitely won't abandon us.

276
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:52,270
It'll finally begin once the sun comes up.

277
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,190
Yeah.

278
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:57,400
I hope we'll all live to see the next day.

279
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,030
Looks like they've come to terms.

280
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,410
Where did the old man run off to?

281
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,290
He went to go scout out the town.

282
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,830
Alone?

283
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,790
Yeah.

284
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:15,710
He said that it would end up being more convenient,

285
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,420
since he's the only one whose face hasn't been seen by the enemy.

286
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:23,470
He said he'd go and check up on a couple of things, such as Colonel Mustang's movements,

287
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,970
but for the most part, I think he's worried about the whereabouts of Lin.

288
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,140
Ah, makes sense.

289
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,020
Are you done making arrangements with Scar and them?

290
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,360
Yeah.

291
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,400
The plan has been decided.

292
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,190
I see.

293
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,490
So it's time at last.

294
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,080
Your brother is pretty gutsy.

295
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,130
He's trapped in there with that monster in pitch darkness, after all.

296
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,590
If it were me, I would have gone crazy by now.

297
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,500
Yeah.

298
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,470
Al's giving it his all.

299
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,760
Now, the rest...

300
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,310
...is up to us!

301
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,200
The Promised Day...

302
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,950
...is here!

303
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:48,430
The promise we never made

304
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:48,430
Kawashita hazu no nai yakasoku ga

305
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,220
yet again

306
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,220
Kyou mo

307
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:54,060
tries to snatch our future away from us.

308
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:54,060
Bokura no mirai wo ubaou to suru

309
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:59,650
Why is it that we can't rejoice

310
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:59,650
Hoshigatteita mono wo te ni shitemo

311
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,650
Sunao ni

312
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,650
straight from the heart

313
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:05,610
when we obtain something we've always been after?

314
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:05,610
Umaku waraenai nowa nazedarou

315
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,330
The overflowing tears aren't from feebleness or remorse.

316
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,330
Afureru namida wo yowasa ya koukai ja nai

317
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:16,120
They're fragments born from agony.

318
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:16,120
Itami ga unda kakera de

319
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:21,170
Of all the moments and destinies,

320
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:21,170
Donna shunkan datte unmei datte

321
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:29,930
I realized there's one absolute certainty.

322
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:29,930
Hitotsu dake tashika na mono ga aru to shitta

323
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,470
Even if things get tough and I'm at my limit

324
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,470
Genkai datte konnan datte

325
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:36,480
I refuse to give up.

326
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:36,480
Akirametakunaiyo

327
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,360
Please, don't let go.

328
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,360
Konomama hanasanaide

329
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:49,200
I can feel the warmth of your right hand

330
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:49,200
Kataku nigirishimeta kimi no migite no nukumori

331
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,870
where it's tightly joined with my left.

332
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,870
Koko ni arukara

333
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:04,090
Denny! Denny!

334
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,590
Hey, Denny!

335
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,970
Shut up...

336
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,390
What do you want?

337
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,680
You need to wake up!

338
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,600
Or else it'll begin!

339
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,270
What'll begin?

340
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,560
The solar eclipse!

341
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,020
Solar eclipse?

342
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:23,610
Geez... what time do you think it is?

343
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,690
It's way too early for the solar eclipse to begin.

344
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,740
H-Hey! Don't look at the sun with that!

345
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,030
You'll go blind!

346
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,370
I know that.

347
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,910
Come here, Brother!

348
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,500
There's smoke rising from town!

349
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,760
Don't leave the house today, got it?!

350
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:59,230
Cedi Squad in the western district reporting.
We've discovered Mustang and his men in District C75.

351
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,600
We're currently engaging.

352
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,480
However, they have the Führer President's wife as hostage,

353
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,730
and it's very difficult for us to attack...

354
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,740
I don't care. Attack.

355
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,610
Huh?

356
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,580
As long as Roy Mustang stays alive, it's fine.

357
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,500
The woman means nothing to us.

358
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,330
Have her killed along with Mustang's men.

359
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,010
Freeze!

360
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,140
Will you shoot?

361
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:46,150
Shoot everyone except for Colonel Mustang!

362
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,290
The peace-accustomed masses are oblivious to the crisis right before their eyes.

363
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,800
They can't even begin to imagine the destruction awaiting them.

364
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:13,380
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

365
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,410
Episode 50, Upheaval in Central.

366
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,410
Upheavel in Central

367
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:22,520
The weak reel in loss, and the strong trample them down.

368
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,020
That is war.
