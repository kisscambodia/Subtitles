00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:05,930
Alchemy is a science where one understands the structure of matter, breaks it down, then rebuilds it.

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:11,520
However, it is not an all-powerful technique,
as one cannot create something out of nothing.

3
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:17,570
If one wishes to gain something,
one must present something of equal value.

4
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:22,070
This is the concept of equivalent exchange, the fundamental basis of alchemy.

5
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,700
However, there is a taboo in alchemy. Human transmutation.

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,370
One must not commit this act.

7
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,930
I've still got a lot of years ahead of me

8
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,930
Kono omoi wo keshiteshimau niwa

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,840
To just erase these feelings?

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,930
Mada jinsei nagai desho?

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:35,890
To just erase these feelings?

12
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:35,930
To just erase these feelings?

13
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,930
Yarinokoshiteru koto

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,930
I want to go back and finish

15
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,560
The things that I've yet to finish.

16
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,560
Yarinaoshite mitai kara

17
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:58,830
I was supposed to be chasing after my ongoing dream,

18
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:58,830
Yume no tsuzuki oikaketeita hazu nanoni

19
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:05,170
Yet I faltered over others while walking this thin, winding path.

20
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:05,170
Magarikunetta hosoi michi hito ni tsumazuku

21
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,340
It's not that I want to return to those days.

22
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,340
Ano koro mitainitte modoritai wake ja nai no

23
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,840
I'm searching for the sky I lost.

24
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,840
Nakushitekita sora wo sagashiteru

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,510
Don't make that sad face, as if you've fallen victim.

26
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,510
Wakatte kuremasu youni

27
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:18,720
Gisei ni natta youna kanashii kao wa yameteyo

28
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:18,720
As if you want people to pity you.

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,430
Tears aren't the end of your sins.

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,430
Tsumi no saigo wa namida ja nai yo

31
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,100
You have to bear them painfully, forever.

32
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,100
Zutto kurushiku seottekunda

33
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,770
Who are you waiting for in the maze of emotions,

34
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,770
Deguchi mienai kanjoumeiro ni

35
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,440
Where you can't even see the exit?

36
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,440
Dare wo matteruno?

37
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,230
I want to blurt it out more justly,

38
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,230
Shiroi nooto ni tsuzutta youni

39
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,980
Just like how I wrote it in my white notebook.

40
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,980
Motto sunao ni hakidashitai yo

41
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,650
What do you want to run from?

42
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,650
Nani kara nogaretainda

43
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,280
That thing called "reality"?

44
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,280
Genjitsu tte yatsu?

45
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,610
I just want to scream out,

46
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,610
Kanaeru tame ni ikiterundatte

47
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,030
"I'm only living to fulfill my wish." Can you hear me?

48
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,030
Sakebitaku naru yo kikoeteimasuka?

49
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,160
I can't take the safe way out of everything.

50
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,160
Bunan ni nante yatterarenaikara

51
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,960
I don't even have a place to return to.

52
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,960
Kaeru basho mo nai no

53
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,250
I'm always thankful for everyone's kindness,

54
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,250
Yasashisa ni wa itsumo kansha shiteru

55
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,630
That's why I want to become stronger. (I'm on the way)

56
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,630
Dakara tsuyoku naritai (I'm on the way)

57
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,590
This is reminding me of the old days.

58
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,590
Natsukashiku naru

59
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,840
This pain is all right with me.

60
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,840
Konna itami mo kangei jan

61
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:08,970
Marcoh, the man who Ed and Al met, possessed
a Philosopher's Stone, although it was incomplete.

62
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:15,640
Moved by Ed's passion, Marcoh revealed the location his research data was hidden.

63
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:25,900
And so, after having his automail repaired,
Ed stood before the place Marcoh's data was located...

64
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,780
National Central Library, 1st Branch.

65
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:35,960
Dr. Marcoh's research data!!!

66
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,210
It was too much effort to look for it,
so I just burnt down the whole building.

67
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:43,010
What did you do at Central?

68
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,510
That's exactly what I've been explaining to you!

69
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,890
The Fullmetal boy found out about Marcoh's data.

70
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:56,350
After I took care of that, I came back to East City to check on things, but...

71
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,730
How's he doing?

72
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,610
Gluttony?

73
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,320
I can smell... I can smell it.

74
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,860
There's an Ishbalan nearby that smells like blood.

75
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,620
Can I eat him?

76
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,950
Sure, but eat every bit of him.

77
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,020
Hidden Truths

78
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,370
There have been no sightings of Scar
since the case involving the Elric brothers.

79
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,750
Maybe he's not in East City anymore?

80
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,250
I need him to be here.

81
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,170
Huh?

82
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:07,300
If I can solve the case that was left unresolved in Central, it should raise my status in the public's eye.

83
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,550
I'll take advantage of everything I can.

84
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:18,350
Until I become the Führer and gain full authority over the military, that is.

85
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,190
You ought to refrain from making inappropriate remarks.

86
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,940
Yeah, I'll try.

87
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,360
Excuse me, sir!

88
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,660
There has been a report of an explosion by Merle River!

89
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,610
What?!

90
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,040
A gas explosion?

91
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,080
No idea.

92
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,120
It's been so unsafe lately.

93
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,420
This belongs to Scar. There's no mistaking it.

94
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,670
Have any bodies been found?

95
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,300
We've been searching, but...

96
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,640
In any case, judging from this blood, it is safe to assume that he's dead.

97
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,770
But still, we cannot let our guard down until we confirm his death.

98
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,600
Second Lieutenant Havoc.

99
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,100
Sir?

100
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,730
Your squad is to clear all of the rubble.

101
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,610
There will be no breaks, whether it be for lunch or supper.

102
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,900
Drag his body out, no matter what it takes.

103
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,700
Give us a break.

104
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,530
Are you trying to kill us?

105
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,370
Shut up!

106
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,200
I can't even calm myself for a date until I see his dead body with my own eyes.

107
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,120
Yeah, okay.

108
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,380
He got away.

109
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,880
I didn't get to eat him...

110
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,380
There, there, maybe next time.

111
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,220
Well, he probably won't be able to do anything for a while after all that.

112
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,850
I'm going back to Central again.

113
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,020
I need to report to Father about Scar.

114
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:48,900
Everything's been burnt to a crisp.

115
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,070
Major Armstrong!

116
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,320
Ah, 2nd Lt. Ross and Sergeant Brosh.

117
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,410
What's the matter?

118
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,660
We've received orders from Headquarters to report.

119
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,500
We will take over the escort of Sir Edward Elric.

120
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,540
All right, understood.

121
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:12,420
What the heck?! Just when I thought I'd get rid of this smothering guy for good, I get more escorts?!

122
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:19,600
There is someone well-versed in the data that was in the Library's 1st Branch.

123
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:23,310
Although she is no longer employed...

124
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,440
Looks like I shouldn't expect much.

125
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,770
Can I help you?

126
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,520
U-Umm...

127
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,990
Pardon my impudence, but why are you wearing a suit of armor?

128
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,780
Just a hobby!

129
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,200
"Hobby"? Second Lieutenant, what kind of hobby is it?!

130
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,530
What's wrong with these kids?!

131
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,160
Man, Al, the scenery is great!

132
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,500
You're right, Brother!

133
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,250
Wha-

134
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,220
What's with these mountains of books?!

135
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,430
Is there really someone living here?

136
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,100
Miss Sheska, are you in?

137
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,560
Miss Sheska!

138
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,060
Someone...

139
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,060
Help me...

140
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,230
Huh?

141
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,480
Hm?

142
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,030
Brother, someone...

143
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,820
Someone is buried under the books!

144
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,570
Dig! Dig! Dig! Dig over here!

145
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:18,860
PLACEHOLDER

146
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,490
Idiot!!

147
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,950
Hang in there!

148
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,750
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

149
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,960
I carelessly knocked over a mountain of books...

150
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,130
I thought that was the end for me!

151
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,710
Thank you so much!

152
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,130
So you're Sheska?

153
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,010
Yes.

154
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,840
The one who was at the 1st Branch?

155
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,840
1st Branch!

156
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,140
Ah, even the name gives off a sweet sound!

157
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:49,600
I've always loved books ever since I was born, and I felt like I was being sent to Heaven when I got a job there.

158
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,730
But I forgot that I was at work and was fired because I was reading all the time.

159
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:01,820
Even though I need a job to send
my sick mother to a better hospital...

160
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:09,540
Seriously... I've got no skills besides reading, and I can't find a job no matter where I go...

161
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,750
That's right! I'm a failure! I'm the trash of society!

162
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:16,050
Umm... I've got something I want to ask you...

163
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,340
Yes?

164
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:21,220
Do you happen to know of any
research documents by Tim Marcoh?

165
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,550
Tim Marcoh... Tim Marcoh...

166
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,720
Oh! Yes, I do remember!

167
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,640
Really?!

168
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,600
I remember it clearly because it was handwritten and shoved into a shelf in the wrong section.

169
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,690
So it really was there...

170
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,900
...which means that it's ashes now...

171
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,160
Did you want to read the research?

172
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,080
Yeah, but it's gone now...

173
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,580
Sorry to bother you.

174
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,580
I remember everything in it, though.

175
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,580
What?!

176
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:57,210
W-Well, I remember the content of every book that I've ever read.

177
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,220
It'll take a while, but would you like me to transcribe it?

178
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,180
Thank you so much, bookworm!

179
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,850
...Worm?

180
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,720
Here is the duplicate of Mr. Tim Marcoh's research!

181
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:15,110
Sorry, it took five days because there was just so much to write down.

182
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,070
There really are amazing people in this world, aren't there, Brother?

183
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,860
Is this really Dr. Marcoh's research?

184
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,990
Yes! No doubt about it!

185
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:27,410
"1000 Meals for Daily Living", written by Tim Marcoh.

186
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,330
Huh?

187
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,500
"Add a bit of water to a tablespoon of sugar"...

188
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,960
These really are 1000 meals for daily living.

189
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,000
Hey! What part this makes it an important document?!

190
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,130
But... all I did was copy things down exactly as I'd remembered!

191
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,050
Looks like we just went on a wild goose chase.

192
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,810
This is word for word what Dr. Marcoh wrote, right?

193
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,350
Yes! Without a doubt.

194
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,350
You're amazing. Thanks a lot.

195
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,860
Okay! Let's take this back to the Central Library.

196
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,240
Yeah. They've got a lot of related books there, too.

197
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,900
Yep.

198
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,450
Oops. I need to reward you for all that work.

199
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:13,370
2nd Lt. Ross, this is my registration code
and silver pocket watch as ID.

200
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,830
Withdraw the amount written on there from
my annual research expenditures and give it to Sheska.

201
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,880
Okay, so I just have to go to the state alchemist facility at the Führer administrative building, right?

202
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,380
Yep!

203
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,140
Thanks again, Sheska!

204
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:28,640
Later!

205
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,890
Hmm, so from his research expenditures...

206
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,810
What's with this number?!

207
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:40,650
He can just pull out a sum like this as if it's nothing?! What is that boy?!

208
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,200
Are these recipes really research documents for alchemy?

209
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,580
Alchemy is dangerous when abused.

210
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,830
To prevent that, alchemists encrypt their research.

211
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,960
An ordinary person may think it's just a cooking experiment; only the one who wrote it will understand the content.

212
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,880
Basically, it's an advanced alchemy document.

213
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,600
How are you going to decipher it
if only the author can understand it?

214
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,720
Knowledge and inspiration.

215
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,390
The rest of it will all be busy work with patience.

216
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:19,100
Wow, this'll take a while...

217
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,900
Al, there's something about a pigeon dish!

218
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,230
Pigeon? Could that be...

219
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,240
Yeah.

220
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,780
It could be about the Green Lion. The philosopher's moon.

221
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,910
Did you bring Flamel's manuscripts
or books on Lambspring's philosopher's stone?

222
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,910
Of course!

223
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,870
Great. Hey, look here.

224
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,210
Hmm?

225
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,790
This has to do with it, too, doesn't it?

226
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,000
Yeah, you're right! This one, too.

227
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:45,010
Yep. All right, let's give it a shot!

228
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:59,270
Why is this encryption hard as hell...

229
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:03,520
Don't you think it'll be faster to just ask Dr. Marcoh himself...

230
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,940
No! If we ask him, we lose!

231
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,860
Is that the problem here?

232
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,900
Umm...

233
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,780
Sheska.

234
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,960
I was able to transfer my mother to a wonderful hospital thanks to you.

235
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,500
I really appreciate it.

236
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,710
No problem at all.

237
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,710
Any progress on the decoding?

238
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,130
Have you found a job?

239
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:37,970
But thanks to you two, I realized that even a failure like me can be useful to others.

240
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,980
Thank you so much.

241
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,480
You're not a failure at all.

242
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,280
I believe being able to wholeheartedly commit yourself to something is a talent in itself,

243
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,280
and you have an amazing memory.

244
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,030
You should have more confidence in yourself.

245
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,570
Thanks.

246
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,910
Yo!

247
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,790
Lt. Colonel Hughes!

248
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,830
I heard from Major Armstrong you guys were back.

249
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,550
Come on... I told you guys to come
say hi when you stopped by Central again.

250
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,590
Sorry, I had urgent matters to take care of.

251
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,300
Yeah, I've been kind of busy too...

252
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,220
He's chatting to Lt. Colonel Hughes like they're buddies!

253
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,100
What are those boys?

254
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:19,390
There's been a lot of incidents and such lately.

255
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:22,600
The case with Tucker and the chimera hasn't been solved yet, either...

256
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,690
Oh... sorry.

257
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,940
I made you remember it.

258
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,860
Well, you know.

259
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:35,240
It's busy enough, and the 1st Branch of the library just had to burn down.

260
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,740
The 1st Branch?

261
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:43,370
Yeah. We kept a lot of case records and whatnot in the archives, so it really messes with our job.

262
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,880
Hm? What?

263
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,760
What do you think, Lt. Colonel?

264
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,680
This woman is looking for a job.

265
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,470
Yes, I have read army criminal records and remember them, but...

266
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,770
All right! Let's get you set up right away!

267
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,270
We pay really well!

268
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,560
That's... umm...

269
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,400
Thank you very much!

270
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,400
I'm going to have more confidence in myself, and I'll try my best.

271
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,190
Thank you so much!

272
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,150
Come on! I need you to get to work right away.

273
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,410
What is he, a kidnapper?

274
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,710
"I believe being able to wholeheartedly commit yourself to something is a talent in itself", huh...

275
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,460
Wise words, little bro.

276
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,970
I really feel that way, especially when I look at a certain someone.

277
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:42,560
Then that certain someone's going to keep working hard.

278
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,540
Oops.

279
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,500
Closing time.

280
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,220
It's been ten days already.

281
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,510
I can't believe they have the fortitude
to work every day until this place closes.

282
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,930
Bullshit!!!

283
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,980
Sibling fight?

284
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,070
You shouldn't get desperate simply because you can't solve it...

285
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,400
We did solve it.

286
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,740
We solved the code.

287
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,160
Seriously? That's great!

288
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,530
Hell no, it's not great!

289
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,740
"The Devil's research"...

290
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,700
"Something you mustn't desire"...

291
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,670
I resent you, Dr. Marcoh...

292
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,290
What... exactly...

293
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,340
The ingredients of philosopher's stones...

294
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,720
...are live humans.

295
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:04,260
And on top of that, you need several sacrifices just to refine one stone.

296
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:08,060
I would have never thought something so inhumane was going on in the army...

297
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,890
That's something that can't be forgiven.

298
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,900
Could you please not tell anyone about this?

299
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,030
But...

300
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,030
Please!

301
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,910
Forget about it.

302
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,290
What...

303
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:32,710
The Elric brothers have locked themselves in their room again today?

304
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,040
Yes. They haven't eaten much, either.

305
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,800
Perhaps they were really tired?

306
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,890
Seems they've been working extremely hard these past days, too.

307
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:45,220
I mean, if that's  what they found after all of that difficult deciphering...

308
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,770
Even I start feeling sick when I start thinking about it.

309
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:49,850
What is it?

310
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,520
N-Nothing!

311
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,190
Sounds fishy!

312
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,450
Brother, go get something to eat.

313
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,280
I'm not hungry.

314
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,870
This is tough.

315
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,460
Yeah.

316
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,130
It's like...

317
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:20,760
Right when you get within arm's reach, it runs away...

318
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:25,930
...and when you finally grab it, it kicks you down.

319
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:32,890
God must really hate humans who have committed taboo.

320
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:39,030
I wonder if we'll be like this for the rest of our lives...

321
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,030
Hey... there's something I've always wanted to ask you...

322
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,290
...but I've been too scared to.

323
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,410
What is it?

324
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:59,130
Elric brothers! You're there, aren't you?

325
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,050
It's me. Open up!

326
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,800
What should we do...

327
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,470
Just ignore him.

328
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,680
I heard the whole story, Edward Elric!

329
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,390
What a tragedy!

330
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,770
To think that such a horrifying secret laid beneath the philosopher's stone!

331
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,360
S... Sorry...

332
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,980
Not much we could do when such
a smothering person approaches you...

333
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,030
To think the army had been doing such a thing...

334
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,740
The truth can be cruel at times.

335
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,450
Truth...

336
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,120
What's wrong, Brother?

337
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,540
Do you remember Dr. Marcoh's words?

338
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,080
Huh?

339
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:38,000
"You may be able to reach
the real truth that is beyond truth..."

340
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,960
The real truth beyond truth...

341
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,760
Same as a research document for alchemy.

342
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,590
What can be seen from the outside is only a portion of the truth.

343
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,720
There's still something else!

344
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,100
Something...

345
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:00,360
There are currently four alchemy research laboratories owned by the government within Central.

346
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,900
The one Dr. Marcoh belonged to is Research Laboratory 3.

347
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,320
This one is the most suspicious.

348
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:14,000
We went around to every research lab in the city,
but this one wasn't particularly...

349
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,960
This. What's this building?

350
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:21,380
That would be Research Laboratory 5,
but it's not being used right now.

351
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,670
No one is allowed to enter it due to risk of collapse.

352
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,920
This is the place.

353
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,340
What makes you say that?

354
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,930
There's a prison right next to it.

355
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,470
And...

356
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,180
Do you remember what's needed to create philosopher's stones?

357
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,770
Umm... was it live humans...

358
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,560
There are bound to be people on the death row at the prison.

359
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,690
They tell the public they were executed, and...

360
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,320
Don't tell me... the prisoners are the ingredients?

361
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,530
Don't make that face.

362
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,490
I don't want to think about it, either.

363
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,580
The prison is under a different
jurisdiction, but if it's involved...

364
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,250
Does this mean the government has something to do with it?

365
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,790
I feel like I've stuck my nose into something horrible...

366
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,340
That's why we asked you to forget about it!

367
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:11,140
This may turn into a political matter.

368
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,180
I'll look into it.

369
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:16,470
But until then, the 2nd Lt. and
the Sergeant are not to speak of it!

370
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,430
Yes, sir!

371
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,230
You two better not do anything, either.

372
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:28,820
You two were thinking of sneaking into the building to check it out, weren't you!!

373
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,740
We weren't! We weren't!

374
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,160
We were.

375
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,210
A guard at an unused building, eh?

376
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,920
Pretty suspicious.

377
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,840
How should we get in?

378
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,630
How about we just make an entrance?

379
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,340
They'll notice the flash of the transmutation response.

380
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,390
In that case...

381
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,100
Here we... go!

382
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,120
This place is completely shut down, too.

383
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,210
Al, wait here.

384
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,460
Will you be all right on your own?

385
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:29,760
Either way, you can't get through here with that big body of yours, can you?

386
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,630
Not like I chose to have a big body!

387
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,810
66.

388
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,980
What, 48?

389
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,190
Our first guest in quite a while.

390
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:47,900
What a reckless dumbass.

391
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,780
This is narrower than I'd thought, dammit.

392
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:55,450
I probably wouldn't have been able to get through if I was normal-sized.

393
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,120
Good thing I'm small.

394
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:03,210
Crap! I called myself small!!!

395
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,840
The lights are on.

396
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:12,720
Not being used right now my ass.

397
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,720
Bingo.

398
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,930
Brother sure is taking his time...

399
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:33,010
Say, the sky we saw that day, the scarlet sky.

400
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:33,010
Ano hi mita sora akaneiro no sora wo

401
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:38,220
Do you remember it from that day?

402
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:38,220
Nee kimi wa oboeteimasuka

403
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:44,140
We made a promise and a vow while the early summer wind circled us.

404
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:44,140
Yakusoku chigiri shoka no kaze ga tsutsumu

405
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:48,400
And we clung close together.

406
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:48,400
Futari yorisotta

407
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:57,450
Muri na egao no ura

408
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:57,450
Your forced smile

409
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:02,830
Holds elongated shadows.

410
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:02,830
Nobita kage wo kakumau

411
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:12,090
I pretend not to notice and continue on.

412
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:12,090
Dakara kizukanu furi saisei wo erabu

413
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:21,600
All the while waiting for you to deliver some news at the table.

414
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:21,600
Teeburu no ue no furuenai shirase machitsuzukete

415
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:29,980
Empty nights, mornings that will never arrive,

416
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:29,980
Kuuhaku no yoru mo kuru hazu no nai asa mo

417
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:34,740
I could see them from a mile away.

418
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:34,740
Zenbu wakattetanda

419
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:40,370
Say, the sky we saw that day, the scarlet sky.

420
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:40,370
Ano hi mita sora akaneiro no sora wo

421
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:45,290
I'm sure you'll remember it one day.

422
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:45,290
Nee itsuka omoidasu deshou

423
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:51,130
While holding the promise we couldn't keep,

424
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:51,130
Hatasenakatta yakusoku wo idaite

425
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:55,380
We take our first steps down our own paths.

426
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:55,380
Futari arukidasu

427
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,340
There was a man who held pride in his swordsmanship,

428
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,140
and there was also another man who understood he was a heretic.

429
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:09,810
The residents of darkness jeer, and
the blades that drank blood are shrieking.

430
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:14,770
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

431
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:17,780
Episode 8, The Fifth Laboratory.

432
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,790
The Fifth Laboratory

433
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:23,820
Ones who seek pleasure in fighting and continue to live forever...

434
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,740
...speak thy names.
