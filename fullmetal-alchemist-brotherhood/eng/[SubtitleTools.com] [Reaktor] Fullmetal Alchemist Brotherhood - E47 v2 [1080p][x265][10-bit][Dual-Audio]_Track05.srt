1
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:23,460
We sigh whenever we're about to come to a standstill

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:23,460
Owarinaki tabi no tochuu tachidomarisouna toki

3
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,710
While moving on this endless journey.

4
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,710
Fukai tameiki kobosu bokura wa

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,430
Everytime we lunge for it, it escapes and flies off.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,430
Tsukamikaketewa mata hanareteitta

7
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,850
But now, there's nothing to be afraid of

8
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,850
Demo ima wa mou nanimo osoreru koto wa nai

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,780
The powerful ties that bind our hearts

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,780
Kokoro wo tsunagu tsuyoi kizuna wa

11
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,240
Keshite hodoke wa shinai sa

12
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,240
Will never come loose.

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,960
After a lifetime of searching, we finally arrived

14
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,960
Sagashitsuzukete tadoritsuita

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,760
Here, where the period lies.

16
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,760
Kono basho de piriodo ni

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:23,060
Let's change all our sorrow and rage to power.

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:23,060
Kanashimi ikari chikara ni kaete

19
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,980
Destiny is right within our reach.

20
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,980
Unmei wa sugu soba ni

21
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,150
On the day before the Promised Day,

22
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,990
Alphonse Elric lies dormant in the Eastern training grounds.

23
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:47,540
However, he is captured by the sudden appearances of the Homunculi, Gluttony and Pride.

24
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,010
Alphonse...

25
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,100
Pick yourself up...

26
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,390
Alphonse...

27
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,600
Who...

28
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,030
It's far too early for you to die.

29
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:22,490
I still have plenty of things for you to do.

30
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,560
Emissary of Darkness

31
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,010
Excuse me...

32
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,760
Are we in Kanama?

33
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,060
Mr. Hoh!

34
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,520
You've got some visitors.

35
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,490
So you're here, Edwa-

36
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,410
God, that felt good.

37
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,370
The first thing you do is punch me in the face?!

38
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,000
And with your right hand, too!

39
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,840
Looks like you made some new friends.

40
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,170
Fri-

41
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,170
We're just working with him due to the circumstances.

42
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,880
And I'm the boss of all of them.

43
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,550
Oh my.

44
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,010
Thank you for taking care of my son.

45
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,180
Not a problem.

46
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,560
Though he's one hell of a brat.

47
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,270
Shut up!

48
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,770
Interesting tattoo you've got there.

49
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:36,900
Oh.

50
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,440
This.

51
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,530
Guess there's no point in hiding it.

52
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,490
You'd better not hide anything either, old man.

53
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,210
Tomorrow is the "Promised Day", right?

54
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,210
Yeah.

55
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,880
I'll tell you guys everything.

56
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,900
Guess you won't be able to accept it as easily as Alphonse did.

57
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,280
You told Al too?!

58
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,110
Yeah.

59
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:26,910
He probably has a lot to think about, but he accepted it.

60
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,710
The philosopher's stone you've been looking for is right here.

61
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,540
Do you want to use it?

62
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,380
Don't fuck with me!

63
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,630
They're lives of people who are totally uninvolved!

64
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,260
We lost our bodies due to our own carelessness!

65
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,420
What gives us the right to use their lives?!

66
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,680
I'm glad my son grew up to say that.

67
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,270
A solar eclipse occurs tomorrow.

68
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,350
He's planning on using that.

69
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,020
A solar eclipse?

70
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,360
How would he use that?

71
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,110
Edward.

72
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,700
Would you be willing to help me stop his plans?

73
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,490
'Help'?!

74
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,030
Don't get the wrong idea!

75
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:13,200
I'm going to beat the hell out of that geezer even if I don't  have to work with you!

76
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:18,920
I'm just listening to what you have to say right now because teaming up with you might increase our odds of 	winning!

77
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,430
I'm glad to hear...

78
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,720
Whatever the reason may be, you're willing to fight alongside me.

79
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:42,400
Granny Pinako asked me to tell you Mom's last words.

80
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,660
"Sorry I couldn't keep my promise."

81
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,700
"I'm going to have to leave you first."

82
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,880
Message delivered!

83
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,810
Hey, shouldn't you try to sit knee to knee with your father and open up to him?

84
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:23,980
Yeah, man.

85
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,900
You should at least call him "Old Man".

86
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,820
Seems like a lot happened in the past,

87
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,030
but he definitely doesn't seem like someone who would abandon his wife.

88
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,040
He probably has a lot of personal reasons.

89
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,700
Come on. Listen to what he has to say.

90
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,660
Shut up already!

91
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,920
I've got a lot of personal reasons, too!

92
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,500
For example?

93
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,380
You're probably just too stubborn and proud.

94
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,590
You can't organize your thoughts very well, right?

95
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,140
Can't really blame you.

96
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,260
He's a philosopher's stone in the shape of a human.

97
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,980
To top it off, he's also your dad.

98
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,480
That's not all of it.

99
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,980
He just showed a side of himself that I wasn't really expecting.

100
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,620
You know... someday, I'll turn into a wrinkled old woman who looks like a monster.

101
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:27,630
But no matter how I end up looking, I'll always be happy to take a picture with the family where everyone is 	smiling.

102
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,470
So please... stay with your family.

103
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,890
Trisha, I'm going.

104
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,180
Please wait for me.

105
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,270
Okay.

106
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,070
I'll be waiting.

107
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,910
"Sorry I couldn't keep my promise."

108
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,330
"I'm going to have to leave you first.", huh...

109
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,340
Even though we couldn't age and die together,

110
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,680
you must believe from the bottom of your heart that I'll come after you in the future.

111
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,310
It'll be tomorrow... Trisha.

112
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,980
Here you go.

113
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,570
Thanks.

114
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,530
What are you going to do with that?

115
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,330
You're going to wear something flashy like this again?

116
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,040
Why's it gotta be red?

117
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:53,510
This is probably going to be our last battle against them.

118
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,180
I'm going to need to be psyched.

119
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,970
Hey, you know...

120
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:05,440
You don't really have to stick with me through all of this.

121
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,480
I personally think it would be better for you guys if you were to leave to attend to your own business from 		here.

122
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,360
Hey, you're one of my henchmen. Don't go ordering me around.

123
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,240
I guess you guys want to return to your original bodies too?

124
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,660
I wonder...

125
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:23,370
This body can be pretty convenient.
I guess I wouldn't mind staying like this forever.

126
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,120
That's the spirit!

127
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,500
Then... why?

128
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,500
Well, you know.

129
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,380
We don't really have anywhere else to go.

130
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:37,010
My animal instincts tell me that I'm better off staying here.

131
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,640
Okay...

132
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,970
And what about you?

133
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,640
Weren't you saying something about running away from the other Homunculi?

134
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,650
You're asking why I came back to Central?

135
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,650
Not tellin'.

136
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,030
What is it?

137
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,380
Al!

138
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,630
Man, don't scare me like that!

139
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,470
I'm glad we were able to join up!

140
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,600
How have you been?

141
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,220
Looks like you were safe and sound too, Brother.

142
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,770
Huh? Aren't you supposed to be with Major Miles?

143
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,020
Is everything going well over there?

144
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,270
I actually wanted to talk to you about that.

145
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,440
Could you come here for a second?

146
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,820
Y-Yeah.

147
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,280
Al... is something wrong?

148
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,660
Why do you ask?

149
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,950
I dunno... I just got a feeling.

150
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,000
Ed!

151
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,460
Lin!

152
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,830
Get away from him!

153
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,250
He's...

154
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,760
That's...!

155
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,270
W-What's going on?!

156
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,150
So you joined them, Greed.

157
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:29,250
And you were taken control of by a human like that...

158
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,000
Your soul is too weak!

159
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,180
The Führer President is still missing?

160
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,390
Apparently, all they found was the corpse of one of his men downstream.

161
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:54,310
It would be a miracle if he were to be alive after this.

162
00:11:54,310 --> 00:12:00,070
I'll lead the search team, and I'll also ask the Northern army to lend us a hand.

163
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,820
You're going to step foot on the front lines yourself?

164
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:07,080
I'll never be able to rest easy until I see his corpse with my own two eyes.

165
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,500
You're not going to target Central as according to your original plan?

166
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,250
Nothing I can do.

167
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:17,590
I'll just have to hand over the fatty portions of Central to Colonel Mustang.

168
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,590
Currently, the Bradley administration is operating without any trouble.

169
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:30,390
If Colonel Mustang and Major General Armstrong were to go through with the operation,

170
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,810
they'll probably be treated as rebels.

171
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:36,600
And when that happens, it'll be my turn to shine.

172
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,440
After they become seen as the villains,

173
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,110
I, Lieutenant General Grumman, the defender of justice, will arrive on the scene.

174
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:50,580
In order for me to stand at the top of this country with the least amount of risk,

175
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:54,500
I'm going to need the younglings to pull the chestnuts out of the fire.

176
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:59,630
That's probably exactly what this raccoon is thinking right now.

177
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,260
I joined forces with him since we're right on the brink of the Promised Day,

178
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,550
but I shouldn't let my guard down until the very end.

179
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,900
A-Al...

180
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,980
It's Pride.

181
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,110
'Pride'?

182
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,700
Yeah.

183
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,490
I guess he's sort of like our eldest brother.

184
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,990
A Homunculus?!

185
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:37,330
So you're going to betray us no matter what, Greed?

186
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,250
Then at this point, you're nothing but an obstacle for us.

187
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,630
Damn you...

188
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,340
How did you know we were here?!

189
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,510
How dare you transform into Al!

190
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,600
I didn't transform into anything.

191
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,140
This is really your little brother's body.

192
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,780
You son of a...!

193
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,820
I'm going to dispose of Greed right here and now.

194
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,450
And then, I'm going to have the Fullmetal Alchemist come with me afterwards.

195
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,410
Hey! You two should hide somewhere-

196
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,750
Wow, you guys sure didn't waste any time, did you?!

197
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,290
Our animal instincts are telling us not to fight that thing!

198
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,920
Are you going to be okay?

199
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,130
Of course I am.

200
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,850
They can't kill Al and I because they need us for whatever reason.

201
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,270
But on the other hand, I can give them everything I've got!

202
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,140
I'm going to beat you to a pulp!

203
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,810
You're right; I'm not going to kill you.

204
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:45,400
However, I can't guarantee that you won't lose a limb or three.

205
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,290
I can't escape into the slums!

206
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,590
You can't guard against this guy!

207
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,550
That was close!

208
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:17,220
Well, I've captured your friend.

209
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:22,770
Do I also have to capture the people in the slums in order for you to cooperate with me?

210
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,690
He's good.

211
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,860
He's going right for your soft spots.

212
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,500
I can't be on the losing side all the time.

213
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,770
What?

214
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:07,440
A power outage?

215
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,820
What's going on?!

216
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:18,080
I can't see anything,

217
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,620
but the eyeballs have also disappeared.

218
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,620
Greed!

219
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,750
Is that you, Heinekel?

220
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,130
What's going on?

221
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,500
What happened?!

222
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,550
A shadow only exists if there is light.

223
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,010
He can't even materialize in the dark,

224
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,680
and can't see anything just like us.

225
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,680
So he left?!

226
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,810
He's just lurking somewhere.

227
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:42,390
If the lights come back on, he'll be back...

228
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,730
What are we going to do, then?!

229
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:49,190
Heinekel... did you see Alphonse's shadow earlier?

230
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,190
Yeah.

231
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,530
There were a lot of these tentacles crawling about.

232
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:53,570
Not that.

233
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,780
He was always near a large shadow, right?

234
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,330
Pride's real body is somewhere within the shadows of the forest.

235
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,790
His real body?!

236
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,410
So it's not in Al's armor?!

237
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,960
Nope.

238
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,670
He has a container just for himself to use whenever he goes out.

239
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,960
What kind of 'container'?

240
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,810
No moon or stars in the sky, huh...

241
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:26,230
They can't maneuver in this darkness either.

242
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,440
Guess I'll just have to wait for the slums to get their power back...

243
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,450
You're not getting away!

244
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,660
So my child's figure doesn't stop you from attacking me.

245
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,910
You're pretty good.

246
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:48,540
You're right. I do feel bad for having to kill a child!

247
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,050
But then again,

248
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,420
my animal instincts are overwhelming my conscience!

249
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,010
It's telling me that I have to kill you here and now!

250
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,010
Ed!

251
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,930
Hey, Ed!

252
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,520
Is that you, Donkey Kong?

253
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,060
How's your little brother doing?

254
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,940
He doesn't seem to have moved at all.

255
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,190
You can hear it when he does.

256
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,320
Okay. Let's leave this place for now.

257
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,900
You're telling me to abandon Al?!

258
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,570
I understand that you're worried,

259
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,910
but what if we were to approach him carelessly, just to find that it was a 	trap?

260
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:29,620
We need to stick together until Heinekel takes care of Pride in order to avoid accidentally attacking each 	other.

261
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,920
Is that... the sound of Lion King fighting?

262
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:41,390
Let's just leave it to the nocturnals for now.

263
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,060
Damn that Pride...

264
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,770
How did he know we were here?

265
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:51,020
That shouldn't be a part of his abilities...

266
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,280
Duck!

267
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,880
Smells like the Fullmetal Alchemist.

268
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,790
Smells like Greed.

269
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,000
Judging from the voice... Gluttony?!

270
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,170
Him?!

271
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,720
Now I get it.

272
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,050
He used Gluttony's keen sense of smell to find us.

273
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:29,680
I also smell a scent of a guy I don't recognize!

274
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,600
I can eat him, right?

275
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,310
He's talking about you, Darius.

276
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,400
That one's also a Homunculus.

277
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,610
How do you expect me to fight against a monster like that?

278
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,490
He's just following his nose.

279
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:46,700
In this situation, you should be evenly matched.

280
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,500
My animal instincts are telling me not to do it, but...

281
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,080
Men are all about guts!

282
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,750
Victory goes to the swiftest!

283
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,890
One more!

284
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,140
Damn it, Donkey Kong...

285
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,980
I thought we were sticking together to avoid attacking each other...

286
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,690
My bad.

287
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:19,320
I guess Gluttony will still have the advantage in the dark.

288
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,940
But if we were to turn on the lights, Pride would...

289
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,700
This is troublesome.

290
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,700
Hey, Greed.

291
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:27,990
That you, Lin?

292
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,830
Switch with me for a sec.

293
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:33,920
I can sense the aura of the Homunculi.

294
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,080
I was also the one to notice Pride, right?

295
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,710
I can fight better than you in this darkness.

296
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,260
Guess I don't have a choice!

297
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,760
You better not run off with this body!

298
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,760
Cut the jokes!

299
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,060
It's my body to begin with!

300
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,720
Rub a dub dub, thanks for the-

301
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,930
There you are!

302
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,650
Nice one!

303
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,530
I'm glad I picked you, man!

304
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,030
I'm honored!

305
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,610
Is it Lin now?!

306
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:03,990
Yeah!

307
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,780
You're making me angry...!

308
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,280
And I'm also hungry!

309
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,240
But you guys aren't letting me eat you!

310
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,950
That's why...

311
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:16,000
...I'm just going to swallow you!

312
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,630
I have a bad feeling!

313
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:18,750
What do you mean?!

314
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,210
Something's coming.

315
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,630
What , exactly?!

316
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,010
This is... just like back then!

317
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:24,880
Hey... Whoa, whoa!

318
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,010
What do you guys see that I don't?!

319
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,390
I'm just a normal guy! Explain it to me!

320
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:41,570
What was that?!

321
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,070
Stay still!

322
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,990
Is there someone else?!

323
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:48,660
I have no idea.

324
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,910
I haven't got a clue, but this is...!

325
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,790
I...

326
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,830
I know this smell...!

327
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,980
Glad to see you're in top shape!

328
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,570
I've been waiting for you, Lan Fan!

329
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:45,210
The promise we never made

330
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:45,210
Kawashita hazu no nai yakasoku ga

331
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,010
yet again

332
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,010
Kyou mo

333
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:50,840
Bokura no mirai wo ubaou to suru

334
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:50,840
tries to snatch our future away from us.

335
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:56,430
Why is it that we can't rejoice

336
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:56,430
Hoshigatteita mono wo te ni shitemo

337
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,430
straight from the heart

338
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,430
Sunao ni

339
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:02,400
when we obtain something we've always been after?

340
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:02,400
Umaku waraenai nowa nazedarou

341
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:08,110
The overflowing tears aren't from feebleness or remorse.

342
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:08,110
Afureru namida wo yowasa ya koukai ja nai

343
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,910
They're fragments born from agony.

344
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,910
Itami ga unda kakera de

345
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,950
Of all the moments and destinies,

346
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,950
Donna shunkan datte unmei datte

347
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:26,710
I realized there's one absolute certainty.

348
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:26,710
Hitotsu dake tashika na mono ga aru to shitta

349
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:29,260
Even if things get tough and I'm at my limit

350
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:29,260
Genkai datte konnan datte

351
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,260
I refuse to give up.

352
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,260
Akirametakunaiyo

353
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:38,140
Please, don't let go.

354
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:38,140
Konomama hanasanaide

355
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:45,980
Kataku nigirishimeta kimi no migite no nukumori

356
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:45,980
I can feel the warmth of your right hand

357
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,650
where it's tightly joined with my left.

358
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,650
Koko ni arukara

359
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:02,580
If you only feel fear after knowing both the abilities of your enemy and yourself,

360
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,750
flee with your tail between your legs.

361
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:08,840
However, if you're going to stand firm and fight with a focused mind,

362
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,090
you will definitely have victory within reach.

363
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:16,390
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

364
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:20,390
Episode 48, The Oath in the Tunnel.

365
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:20,410
The Oath in the Tunnel

366
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:25,400
Is it right or wrong to achieve victory by sacrificing a fellow comrade?
