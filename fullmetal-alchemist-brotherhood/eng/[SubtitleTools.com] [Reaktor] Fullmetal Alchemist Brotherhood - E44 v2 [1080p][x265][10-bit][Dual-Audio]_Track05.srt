1
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:23,460
We sigh whenever we're about to come to a standstill

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:23,460
Owarinaki tabi no tochuu tachidomarisouna toki

3
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,710
While moving on this endless journey.

4
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,710
Fukai tameiki kobosu bokura wa

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,430
Everytime we lunge for it, it escapes and flies off.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,430
Tsukamikaketewa mata hanareteitta

7
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,850
But now, there's nothing to be afraid of

8
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,850
Demo ima wa mou nanimo osoreru koto wa nai

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,780
The powerful ties that bind our hearts

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,780
Kokoro wo tsunagu tsuyoi kizuna wa

11
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,240
Will never come loose.

12
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,240
Keshite hodoke wa shinai sa

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,960
After a lifetime of searching, we finally arrived

14
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,960
Sagashitsuzukete tadoritsuita

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,760
Here, where the period lies.

16
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,760
Kono basho de piriodo ni

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:23,060
Let's change all our sorrow and rage to power.

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:23,060
Kanashimi ikari chikara ni kaete

19
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,980
Destiny is right within our reach.

20
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,980
Unmei wa sugu soba ni

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Revving at Full Throttle

22
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,430
It's been a while, Al.

23
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:37,740
Yeah.

24
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,420
So... I heard from Pinako.

25
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,750
About what happened to your body and such.

26
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,440
There he is!

27
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,600
Mr. Hoh, do you think you could lend us a hand?

28
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,990
Oh, sure.

29
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,910
Let's catch up on things later.

30
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:03,890
S-Sure.

31
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:16,400
That radio you guys fixed for me back then has been working great.

32
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,210
There's no static coming from it anymore.

33
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,750
I'm sorry. All of this happened because we messed with Cornello.

34
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,430
Hey, don't worry about it.

35
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,900
The city came to its senses because you two exposed his crime.

36
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,960
I guess there was a riot, but look at it now.

37
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,630
Aren't those beautiful sounds?

38
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,470
They're rebuilding the city.

39
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,130
Leaving no resentment behind.

40
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,060
I'll go help out too.

41
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,960
Please look after Winry for me, Rose.

42
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,260
I guess we'll see what we can help out with.

43
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,430
Let's go, Yoki.

44
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:03,410
Huh?

45
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,830
What about food?

46
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,460
It'll taste better if you eat after  you work!

47
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,800
Let's go!

48
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,180
Hey! Let go of me!

49
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,710
I want to eat!

50
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,810
Huh? That was your son?

51
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,250
Oh, that must have been awfully rude of us.

52
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,180
It must have been a while since you've seen him.
Can you really just leave him hanging?

53
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,180
Well, I left the house many years ago.

54
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,180
I don't think he trusts me as a father.

55
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,750
Not really sure what to talk about with him...

56
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,560
Dad!

57
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,920
Umm...

58
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,190
I'll help too!

59
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,770
Let me take that for you.

60
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,660
Here.

61
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,510
How's the bath, Winry?

62
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,550
It's the best!

63
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,550
I don't even remember the last time I soaked in the tub...

64
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,600
I'll leave your change of clothes right here.

65
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,310
Thank you so much!

66
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,650
Rose's so sweet!

67
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,120
I find you really admirable, by the way.

68
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,890
You're so young, but you've already set yourself up in the automail business.

69
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,950
Did you make Ed's leg too?

70
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,410
Yeah.

71
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,950
We're old friends, so it was the least I could do.

72
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,720
That's amazing!

73
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,930
So you're the one who gave Ed a leg so he could stand up.

74
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,610
Then in turn, he gave me the strength to stand up.

75
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,270
So in a way, you saved me as well.

76
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,430
I was told my late boyfriend could be revived.

77
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:51,970
Hearing that and believing in their miracles, I gave myself up to Leto.

78
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,440
That was just around the time when Ed and Al came here and exposed the priest's lies.

79
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:04,080
What I've been clinging on to just disappeared like that, so I was feeling pretty hopeless.

80
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,710
And that was when Ed scolded me.

81
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,080
He told me to get up and keep on going.

82
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,520
I'm so sorry! He's always like that!

83
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,340
Why can't he be nicer about things?

84
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,380
It was  nice.

85
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,310
That was Ed's kindness.

86
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,720
You're aware of that too, aren't you?

87
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,360
Thanks to him, we came to our senses.

88
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,310
Everyone in this city, including myself.

89
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:44,650
We're all trying to get back on our feet without relying on miracles.

90
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,170
It's all thanks to Ed and Al.

91
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,880
Ed...

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,060
I followed those soldiers, but I ended up in some crazy place.

93
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,460
Mr. Greed...

94
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:33,280
What is and is not ethical changes with time and also depends on whom you ask.

95
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,570
That is not the reason.

96
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,750
It is to prevent an individual from creating a powerful army of their own, Major General.

97
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,250
They're not actually human...

98
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,710
They're dolls, I take it?

99
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,380
Precisely.

100
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:53,140
We will create soldiers by inserting souls into these humanoids.

101
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,080
They will be the ultimate soldiers that obey our every command.

102
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,000
In other words, an immortal army.

103
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,150
Do you mind if I ask something?

104
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,730
What is it?

105
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,240
Where would you obtain the souls to attach to them?

106
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:16,740
From the people of the countries we've crushed, and have yet to crush.

107
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:22,100
The battlefield will become a hunting ground where we can obtain thousands of souls.

108
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,870
Central is scary!!

109
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,260
It's unbelievably cruel!

110
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,260
There's no way Mr. Greed would be here!

111
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,980
An underground tunnel?

112
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,220
Yeah.

113
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,980
I wanted to check whether there's one under this city.

114
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,130
If there is...!

115
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,890
No, there has to be! Then-

116
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:48,890
Hold that thought.

117
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,650
Let's take this somewhere private.

118
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:58,160
So you came to Lior to prevent the activation of the Nationwide Transmutation Circle?

119
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,070
Yeah.

120
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,710
Then I found you  here! What a surprise!

121
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,170
It makes me feel lucky.

122
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,500
We met a man who looks just like you underneath Central.

123
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,550
I seriously doubt that there's no link between you two.

124
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,450
I figured you knew who he was.

125
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,010
Are you sure this is a good idea, Alphonse?

126
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,060
What if I was on their side?

127
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:28,260
Didn't you consider the possibility that everything you just said could make it to the enemy's ears?

128
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,170
I'm really happy that you trust me.

129
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:42,450
Thanks.

130
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,550
Of course!

131
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:49,960
So he's trusting a failure like me as a real father...

132
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,740
Now...

133
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,860
I guess it's my  turn to trust my sons and to tell them everything I know.

134
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,470
It's a long story.

135
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,970
I want Edward to hear it as well.

136
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,440
The thing is, Brother...

137
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,710
...has gone missing.

138
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,330
Can I help the next customer, please?

139
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:31,290
I'd like to make a withdrawal from State Alchemist Edward Elric's research account.

140
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,370
Would that be you?

141
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,990
No, I'm here on his behalf.

142
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,300
I have a power of attorney and also his signature.

143
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,930
Thank you, sir.

144
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,520
This is the northern branch of Banks Bank.

145
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,440
A withdrawal has just been made from
State Alchemist Mr. Edward Elric's account.

146
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,250
The man claimed to be here on his behalf.

147
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,450
Yes. He was a very large man...

148
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,750
Here's your money.

149
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,200
Okay. This should do.

150
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,580
Jesus, what a rip-off.

151
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,670
What are you talking about?

152
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,210
With the hush money included, this is just the right amount.

153
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:20,120
Well, we appreciate your not probing into our matters.

154
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,760
Darius!

155
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,810
They caught up to us.

156
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,130
Coming.

157
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,690
Oh my, a soldier.

158
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,620
Is someone injured?

159
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,230
We're looking for someone.

160
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,740
Is he your only patient?

161
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,610
Anyone staying in the back?

162
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,330
Just one in the back-

163
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,110
Are you the only one staying here?

164
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,450
Yes... can I help you?

165
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,450
You're the one who went to the bank, aren't you?

166
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,220
Don't move!

167
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,520
Halt!

168
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,810
Are you from this clinic?

169
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,400
Both hands in the air, slowly!

170
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,440
Have you seen anyone going in and out of this clinic recently?

171
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:18,440
His characteristics are...

172
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,400
What's wrong?!

173
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,280
Both hands in the air!

174
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,770
Red coat, blonde hair in a braid...

175
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,280
...and very short.

176
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,290
What was that?!

177
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,210
Harris!

178
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:33,800
Get yourself together!

179
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,290
Who did this to you?!

180
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,090
Hey Harri-

181
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,330
Cohen! Harris!

182
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,470
What happened?! Say something!

183
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,950
Didn't bother to save any for us.

184
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,550
Don't push yourself.

185
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,750
You haven't fully recovered yet, have you?

186
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,080
Don't treat me like a patient!

187
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,280
I'm at full throttle and ready to go!

188
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,800
Thanks for everything, Doc.

189
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,520
No need to thank me. Just go already!

190
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:33,350
Try not to trouble us any further.

191
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:40,190
So they're looking for a blonde guy in a red coat who has his hair in a braid...

192
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:43,320
Maybe I'll stay like this for a while.

193
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,360
Freeze!

194
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,410
Put down your weapons!

195
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,240
There's more of them?!

196
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:51,290
Hands above your head! Now!

197
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:51,950
You!

198
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,580
Get away from those two! They're dangerous!

199
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,340
You're  the one that's going to freeze!

200
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,710
You want to see this kid's head get blown off?!

201
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,640
We're going to secure a vehicle.

202
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,350
Right.

203
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,860
They're after us, Donkey Kong!

204
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,200
Don't call me that!

205
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,950
They're catching up!

206
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,370
They're from the northern army!

207
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,990
I can't outrun them in the snow.

208
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,370
That was close.

209
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,630
How's it looking like in the back?

210
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,130
Bad! They're catching up!

211
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,210
Dammit...!

212
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,960
Take that right!

213
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,970
Get on that street!

214
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:46,590
What?!

215
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,840
Don't ask questions!

216
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,760
Shit!!

217
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,350
I don't get you at all!

218
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,350
As soon as you get past the corner, make a u-turn!

219
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,430
Don't let them get away!

220
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,360
Huh?

221
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,950
W-Where did they go?

222
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,570
I think they made that turn!

223
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,080
That worked out well.

224
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,460
Hey... transmute it back to something simple.

225
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,550
Why?!

226
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,710
This looks badass!

227
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,010
Just do it!

228
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,550
Please, just do it!

229
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,800
What the hell?!

230
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,260
Do you have a problem with my design?!

231
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,680
Too many to list!

232
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,440
We have nowhere to go again.

233
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,650
Yeah.

234
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,070
I wasted so much time because I let my guard down against Kimblee.

235
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:54,780
I wonder if Al was able to meet up with Winry and them...

236
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,040
Hey, Fullmetal! You listening?

237
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,960
What do we do now?

238
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,210
Well...

239
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:05,340
I'd just like some information right now,
whatever that may be.

240
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,300
We need to meet up with Al and the others.

241
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,550
So where are they?

242
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,340
Where do we go to meet up with them?

243
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,810
Where would Al go...

244
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,930
Think... Think...!

245
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,190
You listening?

246
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,200
Well... so...

247
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,330
You were a slave, and now you're a philosopher's stone?

248
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,910
Yup, exactly.

249
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,420
Guess it's pretty unbelievable after all...

250
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,210
Well, I don't blame you.

251
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,420
You'd have to be crazy to believe a story like that out of the blue.

252
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:57,060
Well... I guess I'm crazy then.

253
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,480
You accept things pretty quickly.

254
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,520
To tell you the truth, I'm pretty nervous.

255
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,820
But... I guess it's easier to believe because my body is also like this.

256
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,030
Hey... how does it feel to be immortal?

257
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,910
"How does it feel"...?

258
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,290
I guess it's convenient in many ways.

259
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:26,500
But it's sad that I have to see my loved ones go before me.

260
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,170
Mom?

261
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:39,600
Hey Dad, you're a philosopher's stone,
which means your body isn't exactly normal, right?

262
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,560
Then are Brother and I...

263
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,440
Are you asking whether you two are normal humans?

264
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,440
Yeah.

265
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,690
Don't worry.

266
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:53,530
My soul is fused with the philosopher's stone,

267
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,870
but the actual core that holds me together is myself, a human being.

268
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,450
But the one at Central...

269
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,500
He's only wearing a shell that resembles me.

270
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,380
A shell?

271
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,670
Yeah.

272
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:14,170
So if you break the shell, you should be able to defeat him.

273
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,840
"Defeat"...?

274
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,890
Oh, right.

275
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:24,480
Aren't they trying to recreate the tragedy at Xerxes by using this country?

276
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,980
If we don't stop them soon, there'll be a disaster.

277
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,440
Whoa... not bad.

278
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,360
You've figured out this much.

279
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,490
And this one must be the reverse transmutation circle.

280
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:39,320
The quick way would be to destroy the underground tunnel.

281
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,780
That's why-

282
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,120
Don't even think about it.

283
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,500
A powerful homunculus by the name of Pride lurks in the tunnel.

284
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:51,000
But if we don't hurry, their transmutation circle will be...

285
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,710
It may already be complete, or has been for a while.

286
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,510
Then all the more reason to...!

287
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,510
"The Day" hasn't come yet.

288
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,800
"The Day"?

289
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,310
Alphonse.

290
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,270
Don't be focused on what's at your feet. Look above you.

291
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,810
If you do, you'll be able to see new things.

292
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:11,400
Above...

293
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,480
The sky?

294
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,400
Sun God Leto?

295
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,320
He's waiting for "The Day".

296
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,250
What the hell?!

297
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,870
What did I  do?!

298
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,430
Good!

299
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,600
Lively people like you make me smile.

300
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,680
You have no idea how boring it is to guard this place.

301
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,560
It's a real pleasure having someone like you visit.

302
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,150
The Ultimate Shield...!

303
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,110
Along with that tone and the way you laugh...!

304
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:00,530
Damn you for mimicking Mr. Greed!

305
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,200
That's right, I'm Greed.

306
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,240
Surprised you knew that.

307
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,120
The greedy...?

308
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,540
Yup.

309
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,620
This entire world belongs to me.

310
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,590
I want money, women, status, fame...

311
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,630
"And everything else in this world!"

312
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,300
No way...

313
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,340
But it has to be...

314
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,340
Who are you?

315
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,640
Mr. Greed!

316
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,140
Is it really you?!

317
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,140
What happened to you?!

318
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,640
I'm asking who you are!

319
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,270
It's me!

320
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,150
Bido from Dublith!

321
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,480
You forgot your friend?!

322
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,320
Dublith!

323
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,320
Ah, it all makes sense now.

324
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,450
Do you remember now?!

325
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,410
Sorry.

326
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,330
You're probably talking about the previous Greed.

327
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,330
Why...

328
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,370
I don't know you.

329
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,290
Mr. G...reed...

330
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,460
We're... friends...

331
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,800
Getting rid of intruders is my job.

332
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,220
Sorry man.

333
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:09,810
What's this?

334
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,490
You've got to be kidding me...

335
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,490
You've gotten pretty low, Greed.

336
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:33,500
Why the hell did you kill your own friend?!

337
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,380
He wasn't... my friend...!

338
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,470
Then what about these memories?!

339
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,890
Are you trying to say that Bido guy was spitting out lies?!

340
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,560
They're memories of the previous Greed, not mine!

341
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,810
Then why are you wracked with pain?!

342
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,190
Get your shit together, man!

343
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:00,940
If you start to lose it, my soul will steal back my body!

344
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:06,160
The previous Greed's soul had its memories wiped and purified.

345
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,030
I've forgotten all of my past!

346
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,250
My ass you did!

347
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,120
Friends are connected by heart!

348
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:21,090
You can't just rinse off something that's stained on your soul!

349
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,460
Look!

350
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,760
Your very being is crying out!

351
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:31,350
You've cut down a family member that was connected to you by soul!

352
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,140
Greed!

353
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,730
You're supposed to be greedy enough to want to keep everything !

354
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,730
You disgust me!!

355
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:03,300
The promise we never made

356
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:03,300
Kawashita hazu no nai yakasoku ga

357
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,090
yet again

358
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,090
Kyou mo

359
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:08,930
tries to snatch our future away from us.

360
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:08,930
Bokura no mirai wo ubaou to suru

361
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:14,520
Why is it that we can't rejoice

362
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:14,520
Hoshigatteita mono wo te ni shitemo

363
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,520
straight from the heart

364
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,520
Sunao ni

365
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,480
when we obtain something we've always been after?

366
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,480
Umaku waraenai nowa nazedarou

367
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:26,190
The overflowing tears aren't from feebleness or remorse.

368
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:26,190
Afureru namida wo yowasa ya koukai ja nai

369
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:30,990
They're fragments born from agony.

370
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:30,990
Itami ga unda kakera de

371
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,040
Of all the moments and destinies,

372
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,040
Donna shunkan datte unmei datte

373
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:44,800
Hitotsu dake tashika na mono ga aru to shitta

374
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:44,800
I realized there's one absolute certainty.

375
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,340
Even if things get tough and I'm at my limit

376
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,340
Genkai datte konnan datte

377
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:51,340
I refuse to give up.

378
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:51,340
Akirametakunaiyo

379
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:56,220
Please, don't let go.

380
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:56,220
Konomama hanasanaide

381
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:04,070
I can feel the warmth of your right hand

382
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:04,070
Kataku nigirishimeta kimi no migite no nukumori

383
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:07,740
where it's tightly joined with my left.

384
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:07,740
Koko ni arukara

385
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,870
What about this book?

386
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,710
I read it when I was about your age.

387
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:28,210
It's a tale about an adventurer who travels around the world.

388
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,340
What was that?!

389
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,480
Who is it?

390
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,960
The battle has begun.

391
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,710
No one can hold back his anger anymore.

392
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:07,210
Which one of them will survive?

393
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:11,880
And what is the truth that is
gradually revealed after the duel?

394
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:17,260
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

395
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:21,290
Episode 45, The Promised Day.

396
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,290
The Promised Day

397
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,810
Those who share the same ambition, gather.
