1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,150
The new morning we've finally found

2
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,150
Yatto mitsuketa atarashii asa wa

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,190
is being hampered by the past.

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,190
Tsukihi ga jama wo suru

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,660
What we chased after wasn't the future,

6
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,660
Mukau saki wa tsugi ja nakute

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,490
but the past so full of remorse.

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,490
Sugi bakari oikaketa

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,960
Nariyamanai yousha nai omoide tachi wa

10
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,960
The ruthless memories won't stop playing;

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,050
they won't be forgiving us for a long time.

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,050
Yurushite kuresou nimonai

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,890
It's about now that a teardrop

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,890
Sorosoro kana tesaguri tsukareta hoho wo

15
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,560
beings to roll down my fatigued cheeks.

16
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,560
Kattou ga koboreochiru

17
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,810
Will this rain ever stop?

18
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,810
Ame wa itsuka yamunodeshouka

19
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:52,030
Zuibun nagai aida tsumetai

20
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:52,030
I've been freezing for a long time.

21
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,320
Why does the rain continue to fix on me?

22
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,320
Ame wa doushite boku wo erabuno

23
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,080
I wonder if it could embrace me.

24
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,080
Tsutsumarete iikana

25
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,870
Today, the rain falls again;

26
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,870
Ame wa yamu koto wo shirazuni

27
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,090
endlessly it falls knowing no end.

28
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,090
Kyou mo furitsuzukukeredo

29
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,130
Sotto sashidashita kasa no naka de

30
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,130
We nestle close to each other to share the warmth

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:28,850
under this umbrella, you gently held out to me.

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:28,850
Nukumori ni yorisoinagara

33
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,150
Colonel...

34
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,410
There's no need... for you to perform human transmutation.

35
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,200
You'll do it, won't you, Mustang?

36
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,760
Now!

37
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,440
I will.

38
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,610
Oh, so you'll do it?!

39
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,440
I'll do as you say, Lieutenant.

40
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,110
I will not perform human transmutation!

41
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,370
You're going to abandon her? That's not very nice of you.

42
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,000
Abandon?

43
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,130
That's the last word I want to hear from someone who uses these guys as pawns.

44
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,500
I'm sure they're happy to be my pawns.

45
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,590
They were abandoned by their parents and would have died long ago if it hadn't been for me.

46
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:45,310
Yet, I gave them food and the highest education possible.

47
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,770
I also gave them the meaning to live.

48
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,270
They're thankful.

49
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,940
And this is precisely why you get tripped up by your enemy.

50
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:56,860
What are you-

51
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,870
He disappeared?

52
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,890
Lost Light

53
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,000
Well, I'm  thankful at least.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,300
I was able to capture you thanks to your stupidity.

55
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,420
L-Let go!

56
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,090
Hurry up and let everyone go!

57
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,890
Or else...!

58
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:31,810
I-I'm the only doctor here who can use alchemy!

59
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,360
If you kill me, that woman is as good as dead!

60
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,020
Don't you get it?!

61
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,570
You're sounding pretty darn lame right now, Mister Doctor.

62
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,540
A philosopher's stone...

63
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,800
Get the fuck out of my way!

64
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,220
Lieutenant!

65
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,640
Hang in there!

66
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,350
Lieutenant! Open your eyes!

67
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:12,810
Lieutenant...

68
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:13,730
Lieutenant...!

69
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:14,770
Lieutenant!

70
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,480
You all right?!

71
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,830
If I can just reach that...

72
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,700
Don't die!

73
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,250
Get yourself together, Lieutenant!

74
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,010
This is more important!

75
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:42,970
Leave this to me.

76
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,270
Lieutenant!

77
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,150
I've stopped the bleeding.

78
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,520
You need to let her see a doctor right away.

79
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,480
I'm in your debt. Thank you.

80
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,660
I'm sorry, Colonel...

81
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,700
Don't speak. Just rest for now.

82
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:19,380
Thanks for understanding my glance.

83
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,920
We've known each other for a while, after all.

84
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:28,090
Furthermore, you were glaring at me as if you were trying to say,

85
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,510
"I'll shoot you to death if you perform human transmutation."

86
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,140
That was the last of them, eh?

87
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,980
Thanks, guys.

88
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,900
You saved us.

89
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,280
Don't worry about it, man.

90
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,690
Right! The philosopher's stone!

91
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,080
King Bradley.

92
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,670
His wounds aren't healing...?

93
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,470
Long time no see, Mustang.

94
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,720
It certainly has been a while.

95
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:19,850
You look awfully different from how I remember.

96
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,480
Bradley, eat this!

97
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:14,240
I was certain you'd attempt human transmutation...

98
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:18,950
if someone precious were to fall right in front of your eyes.

99
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,130
You're right, I probably would have back then.

100
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:30,260
But now, I have people by my side who are willing to stop me and point me toward the right path.

101
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:38,390
When you start thinking that humans are pitiful creatures that never learn,

102
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:44,310
there are those like you who knock us off our feet by learning and evolving at such a quick pace.

103
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,020
Humans are just...

104
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,280
...so unpredictable, it infuriates me.

105
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,200
What's the matter?

106
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,710
He's right underneath...

107
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,460
Deep below.

108
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,840
Damn you!

109
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,880
I won't allow you to get in his way!

110
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,970
Give it up, old man.

111
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,260
You're already-

112
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:17,850
Jerso!

113
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,180
Pull yourself together!

114
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,100
G-Get yourselves out of here...!

115
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,360
Shit.

116
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:36,280
Something truly fearsome is approaching.

117
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,150
Look after the lieutenant for me.

118
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,330
Colonel!

119
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,710
A-Attaboy, Bradley.

120
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,510
I sure am skilled at raising-

121
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,450
Colonel Mustang, you're the fifth sacrifice.

122
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,410
The fifth and last.

123
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,380
Again?

124
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,170
Why the heck is it so rowdy today?

125
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,350
Ah, the solar eclipse has begun.

126
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,740
I didn't really want to have to use this method,

127
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,990
but we're fairly short on time right now.

128
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,660
We're going to force you to open the gate, Colonel Mustang.

129
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,330
I certainly won't perform-

130
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,790
It doesn't matter whether you're willing to or not.

131
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:58,090
An alchemist possessing the knowledge of human transmutation was assimilated by Pride.

132
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,100
He has the construction formula.

133
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,810
I've secured him.

134
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,430
Step aside, Wrath.

135
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,700
Well, I'm curious as to what they're going to take from you.

136
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,290
Colonel!

137
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,710
No! You'll be dragged into it!

138
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,540
Colonel!!

139
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,860
The transmutation is complete.

140
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:58,150
That's the four-eyed geezer?

141
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,990
Where is the Colonel?

142
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,070
Worry not.

143
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:05,530
He should be with our father by now.

144
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,790
Though I certainly can't guarantee that he is with no physical defects.

145
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:17,250
As you can see, I'm fatally wounded.

146
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:25,260
Who shall be the one to win fame for defeating the Führer President of Amestris?

147
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,760
Will it be a chimera?

148
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,260
A foreigner?

149
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,520
Mustang's pet?

150
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:35,060
Or perhaps, will all of you band together to take me down?

151
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,190
What the hell...?

152
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,690
Why do I get the feeling we won't stand a chance against one wounded old man?

153
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,820
Underneath...

154
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,200
Right beneath that hole.

155
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:52,120
The four-eyed geezer went nuts as soon as May said there's someone underneath that place.

156
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,540
Said something about not letting us get in his way.

157
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,040
Seems like they don't want us going further underground.

158
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,920
So that must be the center.

159
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,670
That's right.

160
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,760
I feel a huge cluster of energy right below us.

161
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,430
If that's the case...

162
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,300
Colonel!

163
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,260
He's the fifth sacrifice, father.

164
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:56,520
I'd like to say that we've gathered all five,

165
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,220
Are you all right, Colonel?!

166
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,270
Colonel!

167
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,230
Get yourself together, Colonel!

168
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,520
but Alphonse Elric has yet to come over to this side.

169
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,690
Are you okay, Colonel?!

170
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,280
Fullmetal...?

171
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,410
Where the hell are we?

172
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,910
We're with the big cheese now.

173
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,910
What in the world happened, Colonel?

174
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:22,040
I was thrown in front of a large gate in some white room...

175
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,300
Gate?!

176
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,960
Don't tell me they took something from you?!

177
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,430
But you still have all your limbs...

178
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,640
I'm surprised you can see me when it's so pitch-dark out here, Fullmetal.

179
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,220
What are you talking-

180
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,400
It's too dark for me to see anything.

181
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,280
The light.

182
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,110
Where's the light?

183
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,290
I-It couldn't be...

184
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,580
So you've lost your vision.

185
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,500
How convenient.

186
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:11,640
Truth be told, you have the most troublesome ability out of all the state alchemists,

187
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:17,180
so I'd much rather you sit there and weep.

188
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,640
Colonel...

189
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,310
You performed human transmutation...?

190
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,770
Fullmetal.

191
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,690
Do you really think I'd do something like that?

192
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:36,450
We forcefully had him open the gate.

193
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,370
But the result is all that matters.

194
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:44,500
Though Colonel Mustang would have been the most troublesome opponent,

195
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,340
with this, he's utterly useless in battle.

196
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,920
Truth is cruel.

197
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:56,260
Out of the cocky ones who tried to revive the dead in order to be embraced by their mother's warmth again,

198
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:01,060
one of them was robbed of his leg with which to stand, and his one and only brother was also taken from him.

199
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,070
The other was stripped of his entire body which left him unable to feel warmth at all.

200
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:13,360
The woman who longed for her dead child was given a body no longer able to reproduce.

201
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,830
Now, the one who had his eyes fixed on the country's future was robbed of his vision;

202
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:22,120
never again will he be able to see what the future holds.

203
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:27,710
He gives humans their suitable forms of despair to prevent them from getting too conceited.

204
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:32,590
He is the existence which you humans refer to as 'God'.

205
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,220
Truth.

206
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,560
How is that fair?!

207
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:47,150
Those of us who acted on our own initiative certainly deserved it.

208
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:54,490
But someone who wasn't even willing was dragged into human transmutation, robbed of his vision,

209
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,490
and you say that's well-deserved?

210
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:00,580
Truth is too illogical for me to accept!

211
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,050
Are you planning on getting in father's way?

212
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,620
What is your true name?

213
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,330
I have no name.

214
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,500
I've disposed of it.

215
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,460
What a coincidence.

216
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,670
I, too, do not know my real name.

217
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,640
A duel to the death between two nameless beings shall make quite a show.

218
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,210
May!

219
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:32,590
There he is.

220
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,340
How dare she open up a hole on the roof of my house...

221
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,100
He looks different now, but judging from that aura...!

222
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,390
You're the immortal leader, aren't you?!

223
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,140
Sir Alphonse?!

224
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,520
What happened to you?!

225
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,770
I don't know.

226
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,100
He just won't wake up.

227
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:51,980
No way!

228
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,230
Sir Alphonse! Sir Alphonse!

229
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,490
Please, wake up!

230
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,490
Sir Alphonse!!

231
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,170
It's...

232
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,590
It's... my body...

233
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,650
I've been waiting for you.

234
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,700
Welcome back.

235
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,840
What's with this thin arm?

236
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,510
I'm skin and bone.

237
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,430
I'm barely able to stand.

238
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,260
I...

239
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,180
There's...!

240
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,690
There's no way I'll be able to fight with that body!

241
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,150
Everyone's giving their all!

242
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,940
You don't want to reunite with me?

243
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,320
Of course I do!

244
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,950
I've... I've always dreamed of getting my body back!

245
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,990
But...

246
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,000
Not now.

247
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,630
I won't be able to fight with that body!

248
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:39,380
Not with that body...

249
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,090
Do you want to go back to the other side?

250
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,220
Would you like to go back with that body?

251
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,390
If so, I won't stop you.

252
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,680
Sorry.

253
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,930
I'll come again.

254
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,310
Hang in there for a little longer!

255
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,350
I'll definitely come again!

256
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,270
I swear! It's a promise!

257
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:43,610
Al!

258
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,780
You okay, Al?!

259
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,860
Sir Alphonse!

260
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,450
Al!

261
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,450
Master.

262
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,580
Brother.

263
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,660
May!

264
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,700
Wait, where am-

265
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,090
In order to help your friends,

266
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,340
you leave behind the body you've been longing after for years.

267
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:07,260
My soul, you are beyond dignified.

268
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,430
I am nothing but proud to be your container.

269
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:19,020
But the fact that you went back may lead to the world being submerged in despair,

270
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,520
Alphonse.

271
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,730
That...

272
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,780
...makes all five of you.

273
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,800
Ano hi kara zutto

274
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,800
Ever since that day passed,

275
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,050
I promised myself that I'd never cry.

276
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,050
Nakanaito kimetekitakedo

277
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:51,600
But even while I hoarded up the pain,

278
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:51,600
Itami wo kasanetemo

279
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,710
there was something I couldn't forgive myself for.

280
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,710
Nanika wo yurusezu ni ita

281
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,150
I'll never be able

282
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,150
Mou modorenai

283
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,650
to return to those days.

284
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,650
Ikutsumo no hibi

285
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:07,740
I'm still powerless.

286
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:07,740
Boku wa mada nanimo dekizuni

287
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:12,990
I watch as the shards of memories disappear, one by one;

288
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:12,990
Kimi no ita kioku no kakera

289
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:18,860
memories of when you were still with me.

290
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:18,860
Mata hitotsu kieteyuku

291
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,880
I long to become

292
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,880
Kyou yori motto

293
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,630
stronger than I am now,

294
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,630
Tsuyoku naritai

295
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:29,770
so that my voice will eventually reach you.

296
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:29,770
Kono koe ga itsuka todokuyouni

297
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,140
If the wind happens to stop

298
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,140
Arukitsuzukete

299
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,850
in the midst of my long journey,

300
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,850
Kaze ga yandara

301
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:39,560
I'll look up at the sky in search of you.

302
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:39,560
Kimi wo sagashite sora miageruyo

303
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:46,900
Beyond the daybreak, a ray of light breaks free.

304
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:46,900
Yoake no saki ni hikari ga sasuyo

305
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:52,450
A rainbow spans across the sky.

306
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:52,450
Niji ga kakaruyo

307
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,710
Courage is brought into submission by force,

308
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:07,000
and happiness is shattered to pieces.

309
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:12,680
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

310
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:18,680
Episode 60, Eye of Heaven, Gateway of Earth.

311
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:18,700
Eye of Heaven,
Gateway of Earth

312
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,940
The world became engulfed in darkness.
