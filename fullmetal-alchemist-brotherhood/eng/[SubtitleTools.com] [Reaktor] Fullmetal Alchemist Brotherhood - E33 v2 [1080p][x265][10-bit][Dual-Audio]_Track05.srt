1
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,870
Can't focus. My body is still puzzled about what to do.

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,870
Shuuchuu dekitenaina mada karada ga mayotteirunda

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,630
I'm trembling. I can't stop even if I try to control myself.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,630
Furueteitanja kontoroorushitatte burerunda

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,380
Although neither sun nor moon are on my side,

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,380
Taiyou mo tsuki mo nanmo kanzen ni kocchi muiteinaiga

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,800
"I've no choice but to try,"

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,800
Yarushikanainda

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,470
Those were the words I muttered to myself.

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,470
Iikikaseruyouni sotto tsubuyaita

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,060
Joukyou wa waruiga tada nigedasunja konjou nainaa

12
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,060
The odds aren't on my side, but running way'd be gutless.

13
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,060
Even if I can't see the future, I'll just have to win it over with courage.

14
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,060
Tenbou wa naiga dokyou de kuria suru shika naiya

15
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,560
Need to keep distance from the target as I hold myself back.

16
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,560
Shoudou wa osaetamama taagetto to no kankaku sagure

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,860
All that's needed for victory is pride to win.

18
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,860
Hitsuyou na mon wa katsu puraido

19
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,950
Will we celebrate with the wine of victory

20
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,950
Ajiwau nowa shouri no bishu ka

21
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,950
Or'll we end up kissing their feet in defeat?

22
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,950
Soretomo haiboku no kujuu ka

23
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,700
There are two outcomes to everything.

24
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,700
Sou subete wa futatsu ni hitotsu

25
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,420
I want to control destiny.

26
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,420
Ayatsuritai unmei no ito

27
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,750
I need to seize the golden opportunity with my hands.

28
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,750
Zekkou no goorudentaimu kono te de tsukame

29
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,840
I'll finish it up with my best poker face,

30
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,840
Konshin no pookaafeisu kimete shikakeruyo

31
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,800
And drag them into a world of illusions.

32
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,800
Iryuujon no sekai e hikizurikonde

33
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,140
Saigennai puresshaageemu sururito nukete

34
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,140
I'll find my way out of this endless pressure game,

35
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,150
And leap over the borderline of honor.

36
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,150
Eikou no boodaarain tobikoeru tameni

37
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,860
How many? What'll I need to sacrifice to make it happen?

38
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,860
Haumenii? Dorekurai no daishou ga iru?

39
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,120
What is the one thing I don't want to let go?

40
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,120
Tebanashitakunai mon wa dore?

41
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:37,690
Ed and Al were searching for May, a girl from Xing, to find out more about Eastern Alchemy.

42
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,860
They are now headed north after learning she was headed in that direction.

43
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:51,450
At the same time, Kimblee, the Crimson Alchemist, is after Scar, who had just left Central and is now westbound.

44
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:58,670
But Scar suddenly disappeared in the darkness of the night.

45
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,510
If they were to jump off the train, it would surely be around here, where the track is full of curves,

46
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,760
since the engine would decelerate.

47
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,020
Now the question is, where did they go after they jumped off?

48
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,940
Have there been any sighting reports on Scar?

49
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,770
None at all, sir...

50
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,610
That's very strange.

51
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,780
He had been attracting a lot of attention up until this point.

52
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,200
Reporting in, sir!

53
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,620
A small boat by the river has been stolen about 200 meters south of here!

54
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,790
Was it Scar?

55
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,160
There haven't been any sightings so far.

56
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,040
Go investigate.

57
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,000
Roger!

58
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,460
Reporting in, sir!

59
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,920
We've received a report from an old man, who lives in the area, of two suspicious-looking men heading westbound.

60
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,420
Now they're heading west?

61
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,800
Send some men over and capture those two immediately!

62
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:48,840
Roger!

63
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,100
Is something the matter?

64
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,060
No, it's just that...

65
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,190
There's a mountain trail on this map that heads north.

66
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,400
Why is it crossed out?

67
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,940
There used to be a path through
the forest to get to the northern area,

68
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,990
but it's been closed down due to landslides.

69
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,700
What about the path, sir?

70
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:32,390
There are several other places beyond this point that have been closed off due to landslides.

71
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,860
It looks like the stream has moved.

72
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,030
It seems so... but are you saying it means something?

73
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:58,120
For an alchemist skilled in destruction, removing an obstacle such as this is a walk in the park.

74
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:05,460
It's also simple to destroy the surface of a mountain and to block off the road with the rocks.

75
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,130
Signs of transmutation?!

76
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,340
Send the troops north.

77
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,910
The Northern Wall
of Briggs

78
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,570
Snow!

79
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,710
Brother!

80
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,720
Geez, you're so fidgety!

81
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,760
Shut up, I just slipped.

82
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,270
Man, look at all the snow!

83
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,520
Yeah. We rarely see snow in Resembool.

84
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,810
Oh yeah, Al.

85
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,900
Do you remember when it snowed heavily in Resembool when we were kids?

86
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,900
Heavy snowfall?

87
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,490
Oh, I remember now!

88
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,620
We had a snowball fight!

89
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,450
We made a snowman, too, remember?

90
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,290
Yeah!

91
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:28,960
Back then, I never would have thought that I'd come this far north...

92
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,090
But we did, didn't we?

93
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,140
Well, what to do now?

94
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,610
We've still got time until the train to Briggs departs.

95
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,230
Why don't you go eat something nice?

96
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,570
I'm not really hungry...

97
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,700
But I guess I'll go see what's on the menu!

98
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,080
Hey! If you start running, you'll slip again!

99
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,620
Shut up!

100
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,620
Yes. Three hours ago...

101
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,880
Scar's description, document number, and...

102
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,460
Any new information so far?

103
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:12,010
We're trying our best, but we haven't found anything yet.

104
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,840
A man matching Scar's description was sighted at the marshalling yard at the next station.

105
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,350
Is this confirmed?

106
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,720
Yes, sir.

107
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,520
He was last seen climbing into
a troop transport headed for Briggs.

108
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,810
Was there anyone with him?

109
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,940
A middle-aged man with black hair.

110
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,230
Matches the initial report perfectly.

111
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,110
We'll have the train stopped immediately.

112
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,650
There's no need for that.

113
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,990
It would be troublesome if they leap off again.

114
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,380
I'll take over from here.

115
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,130
Please don't interfere with my work.

116
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,680
Sleep for now.

117
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,640
When we get further north, you'll have
a hard time sleeping because of the cold.

118
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,120
I'm jumping over. Please try to match the speed of the other train.

119
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,820
Yes, sir!

120
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,140
Dr. Marcoh.

121
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,650
I've come to pick you up.

122
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,440
You've got nowhere else to run.

123
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,900
Are you alone?

124
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,530
Where is Scar?

125
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,530
You just don't know when to quit, do you?

126
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:44,450
Didn't I just say you had nowhere else to run, Doctor Mar-

127
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:49,870
Who are you?

128
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:03,050
So you're the Ishbalan everyone's talking about...

129
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,540
You can't expect me to put up with those monsters!

130
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,500
Now's my chance to jump off...

131
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,260
Impossible...

132
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:00,110
Solf J. Kimblee. The Crimson Alchemist.

133
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,860
Do you remember me?

134
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,200
Yes. Very clearly, in fact.

135
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,370
You were in the Kanda district of Ishbal.

136
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,830
Was it your family that was around you at the time?

137
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:19,540
I believe there was someone who closely resembled you, but with glasses.

138
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,130
Bleeding heavily from his left abdomen...

139
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,970
...and writhing in pain...

140
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,560
This isn't good.

141
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,990
I'm rusty from being in jail for all this time, but he's been fighting since the civil war.

142
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,200
In terms of stamina, I'm at a disadvantage.

143
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:52,370
However, all he can do is destroy-

144
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,960
Left abdomen, was it?

145
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,510
I won't give you the time to pray.

146
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,600
It's... a shame...

147
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:15,770
That I'd fail to kill the same Ishbalan twice...

148
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:34,580
How humiliating that I have to run away...

149
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,080
We'll settle the match next time, Ishbalan!

150
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,470
Kimblee!!!

151
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,060
Dammit, I can't see!

152
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,770
What the hell was that noise?

153
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,110
One of the cars is missing!

154
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,910
We can't! We've been ordered by the army not to stop the train!

155
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,910
No, we have to!

156
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:19,120
It'll be our fault if the train derails!

157
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,310
What... happened to you?!

158
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:38,350
Hey!

159
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,980
Who the hell said you could stop the train?!

160
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,690
What?!

161
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,520
Keep the train running.

162
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,980
Head north!

163
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,990
Good... death is chasing me.

164
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:59,410
Ones who kill are also chased by death.

165
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,250
Always living alongside death...

166
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,340
Jobs that risk one's soul are truly beautiful!

167
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,760
How rewarding...

168
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:15,180
My battlefield!

169
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,940
I wonder if Mr. Scar and Mr. Yoki are all right?

170
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:32,570
Since no one has come after us yet, it must mean they're doing a good job drawing the army's attention.

171
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,030
I hope they're safe.

172
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,910
Dr. Marcoh?

173
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:40,700
No, it's just that...

174
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,210
The northern wind is painful against healing skin.

175
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:48,380
Sorry. I wish I could have healed it to make it look a little better...

176
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,880
No, the face fits me well.

177
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,470
I'm happy with it.

178
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,680
Take a look, May.

179
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,970
Wow!

180
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,270
They're the Briggs Mountains.

181
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,980
The mountain range that serves as the border between our country and Drakma.

182
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:11,780
We should be close to the location Scar pointed out...

183
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,990
Let's see...

184
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,450
We're almost there!

185
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:42,520
Huh? He checked out of the hotel?

186
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,770
Yes, just yesterday.

187
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,690
Do you know where he went?

188
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,900
If I recall correctly, he said that they were headed north...

189
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,730
I see...

190
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:52,900
Thanks.

191
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,950
That idiot...

192
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,450
What's wrong? Were they doing well?

193
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,500
He said they headed north in that state.

194
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,210
Oh, my! He's totally...

195
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,130
...gonna die.

196
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,960
Did you catch a cold, Brother?

197
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,470
So cold...

198
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,380
It's Briggs, all right.

199
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,510
We're here, boys.

200
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,810
If you follow this mountain path, you'll get to the Briggs fortress.

201
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:29,690
Thanks.

202
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,770
Oh yeah, you.

203
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:33,530
Me?

204
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:34,780
Yeah, you.

205
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,490
That's not an automail, is it?

206
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,610
Nope.

207
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,200
Oh. Then you should be fine.

208
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,490
What was that about?

209
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,620
No idea.

210
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,580
Everything beyond that fence is owned by the army,
so you'll die if you stray from the path!

211
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,920
Huh?

212
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,920
Let's go!

213
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,010
Yeah.

214
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,730
They say the weather changes rapidly in the mountains, but I never expected something like this...

215
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,280
What should we do, Brother?

216
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,280
We've completely lost our way.

217
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,030
Don't worry!

218
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:28,120
Master Izumi was thrown into the Briggs Mountains in the winter for a month for her training, and she still survived.

219
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,290
There's no way that could be true!

220
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:32,290
How could someone survive for a month out here?!

221
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,790
But she said she defeated a bear, too!

222
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:38,670
The bears at Briggs grow to a height of up to two meters!

223
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,430
Who'd be able to defeat one?

224
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,140
A bear!!!

225
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,480
That's not a bear!

226
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,360
Al!

227
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,620
Hey, hang on!

228
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,620
You're wearing a military uniform!

229
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,870
You have an automail, too?

230
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,420
Just an ordinary one, it seems.

231
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,380
Yours is just plain ugly!

232
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:21,170
How foolish of you to not understand the beauty of this arm!

233
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,510
Combat Model Automail M1913-A Crocodile.

234
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:32,770
Surrender if you don't want to be ripped to shreds, Drakman spy!

235
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,060
Spy?

236
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,020
What the hell are you talking about? I'm...

237
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,320
Why, you...

238
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,450
Can't you be a little more understanding, oaf?

239
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,570
What is this pain?

240
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,790
My automail isn't moving very well!

241
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,330
You're mine!

242
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:53,750
Brother!

243
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,830
You bastard...

244
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,340
Just listen to me!

245
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,130
You're still going to resist?!

246
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,510
Are you serious?!

247
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,350
Wait! Wait! Wait! Just listen!!

248
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:10,060
Your useless automail is mine!

249
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:15,560
More like, your  arm is mine!

250
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,020
Did you do something?

251
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,030
Time out! Time out! Time out! Seriously! Time out!

252
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,910
Why doesn't alchemy work?!

253
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,410
This isn't made out of iron?!

254
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,830
Brother!

255
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,790
Thanks, Al!

256
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,500
Are you okay?

257
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,750
That freak...

258
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,960
I would've been killed by Winry before I froze to death out here.

259
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,050
Not bad, brat.

260
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:48,180
You did well for having a regular automail.

261
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,850
But this is it for you.

262
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:50,470
What?

263
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,730
Security personnel from Briggs?!

264
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:06,110
Geez, at gunpoint again?

265
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,290
Brother.

266
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,290
A wall?

267
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:16,910
What's the matter, Captain Buccaneer?!

268
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:22,090
I'm sorry for causing such a commotion, Major General Armstrong!

269
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,760
Armstrong?

270
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,770
So that's the person Major Armstrong wanted to introduce to us...

271
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,060
...Olivier Mira Armstrong?

272
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,110
Major Armstrong's sister!

273
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,360
But...

274
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,110
She looks nothing like him.

275
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,660
She's not huge.

276
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,820
Who the hell are you?

277
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,000
Edward Elric, the Fullmetal Alchemist.

278
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:01,460
I came to see you, Major General, with a letter of introduction from Major Armstrong from Central.

279
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,460
Please get these guys off of us, first!

280
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,920
Perform a full body check!

281
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,880
What?!

282
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,880
We're not suspicious in the least bit!

283
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,720
How should I know?

284
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:15,100
Anyone can pretend to be someone well-known.

285
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,430
What?! There's no one in here?!

286
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,560
That bitch...

287
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,100
Hm? This is...

288
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:22,900
Ma'am!

289
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,490
That's the letter from Major Alex Louis Armstrong.

290
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:31,280
If you read it, you'll know that we're not suspicious at all.

291
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,370
It really is from Alex.

292
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,670
You're not even going to read it?!

293
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,540
Testimonials mean nothing to me.

294
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,170
I don't need assessments made by others.

295
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,550
I'll judge you with my own eyes.

296
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,360
A-Amazing.

297
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,990
It's huge...

298
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,860
What the hell is this?!

299
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:15,200
Come in, Fullmetal Alchemist.

300
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,410
Awesome! It's so tall! It's huge!

301
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,790
Hurry up and walk, laggards.

302
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:24,380
Want me to rip that antenna off your head?

303
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,010
I'll tell you this now. I won't be treating you like a kid.

304
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,550
This is Briggs, the land of natural defense.

305
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,600
A world where the weak are victims of the strong.

306
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:53,790
Even if we part and meet again, I want to meet at this place.

307
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:53,790
Megurimeguttemo mata koko de aitai

308
00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:00,720
Then we'll hold hands to ensure we'll never be separated again.

309
00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:00,720
Hagurenaiyouni kono te wo tsunagunda

310
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,350
We used to talk all night until the sun rose,

311
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,350
Asahi ga noboru made katariattane

312
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,180
And held hands till the sun went under the horizon.

313
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,180
Yuuhi ga shizumu made tsunaida te

314
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:11,430
Let's walk together like this forever, like light and shadow.

315
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:11,430
Kouyatte asu mo asatte mo tomo ni ayumou hikari to kage

316
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,980
I stand in the city, staring off into space with lonely eyes.

317
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,980
Samishige ni mitsumeru machi no naka de

318
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:21,320
I can't find warmth on my own.

319
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:21,320
Nukumori wa hitori ja mitsukaranakute

320
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:26,830
By meeting you, I realized

321
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:26,830
Ai ga konnani tsuyosa ni narukoto

322
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:32,660
Shittanda kimi ni deaete hajimete

323
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:32,660
How much strength love could give me.

324
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:37,920
Even if we part and meet again, I want to meet at this place.

325
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:37,920
Megurimeguttemo mata koko de aitai

326
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:43,220
Then we'll hold hands to ensure we'll never be separated again.

327
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:43,220
Hagurenaiyouni kono te wo tsunagunda

328
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:48,430
I can't sleep by myself, 'cause I can't dream without you.

329
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:48,430
Hitori ja nemurenai yume wa mirenaikara

330
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:54,190
So take me to a place where uncertainty can't reach us

331
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:54,190
Donna fuan mo todokanai tokoro e

332
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:59,440
And let us bring light to the night sky with no stars.

333
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:59,440
Hoshi no yoru mo terashitsuzukeyou

334
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,940
So long as you're with me, I can go to world's end.

335
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,940
Doko made mo yukeru kimi to nara

336
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,950
Even if it's a path I can't walk on my own,

337
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,950
Hitori ja arukenai michi mo futari nara

338
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,990
If you're by my side, I can walk it while humming a tune.

339
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,990
Hanauta utainagara arukerunda

340
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:11,410
If we're together, the world is mine.

341
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:11,410
Kimi ga ireba shiawase

342
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,530
There it is!

343
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,590
So these are his brother's research documents.

344
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:37,840
A combination of the alchemies from Xing and Amestris.

345
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,550
I wonder if there's anything about immortality in here?

346
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,510
I hope there is.

347
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:50,400
Now, will this become a book of hope,
or will it turn out to be a book of despair...

348
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,490
Let's begin the analysis.

349
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:03,560
The general of Briggs, Olivier Mira Armstrong.

350
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:08,520
Fierce and powerful, she is Amestris' guardian of the north.

351
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:12,900
She has no fears, though there are many that fear her.

352
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:18,240
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

353
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,250
Ice Queen

354
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,250
Episode 34, Ice Queen.

355
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,460
This is how we do things in Briggs.
