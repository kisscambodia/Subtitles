1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:06,190
Drawn by a landscape as white as snow,

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:06,190
Masshiro na keshiki ni ima sasowarete

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,740
I'm headed toward an unseen world.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,740
Boku wa yuku yo mada minu sekai e

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,680
I've been traveling while lost

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,680
Maigo no mama tabi shiteita

7
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,470
Under this gray sky.

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,460
Nezumiiro no sora no shita

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,560
Every day with new maps, stained with my many dreams.

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,560
Higawari no chizu ikutsumo no yume ga nijindeita

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,950
I wonder if someday,

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,950
Itsuka wa sa

13
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,990
Even with these tiny steps of mine,

14
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,990
Chippoke na boku no kono hohaba demo

15
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:43,070
I'll be able to travel beyond those clouds.

16
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:43,070
Ano kumo no mukou made yukeru kana

17
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,700
I put on a bold front.

18
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,700
Tsuyogatte

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,250
End up hurting myself.

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,250
Kizutsuita

21
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,330
Kokoro sukashita youni

22
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,330
I feel empty inside.

23
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,870
It's started to rain,

24
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,870
Furidashita

25
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,040
And the raindrops

26
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,040
Amatsubu tachi ga

27
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,260
Began to repeat their scattered reflections.

28
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,260
Ranhansha kurikaesu

29
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,130
These straight rays of light

30
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,130
Massugu na hikari ga

31
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,850
Kousa shite

32
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,850
Start to cross one another.

33
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,430
And without telling anyone where they're headed,

34
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,430
Yakusaki mo tsugenumama

35
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,720
Across the endless distances,

36
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,720
Doko made mo

37
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,310
They pass through all matter.

38
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,310
Tsukinukeru

39
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:14,140
I burn these faint afterimages onto my eyes.

40
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:14,140
Awai zanzou ryoume ni yakitsukete

41
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,060
Under this sky,

42
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,060
Kono sora no shita

43
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,890
Donna toko ni itemo

44
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,890
Wherever I am,

45
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,190
I should be able to reach

46
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,190
Todoku hazu nanda

47
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:27,000
The unseen world.

48
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:27,000
Mada minu sekai e

49
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,520
Edward, huh?

50
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,480
You've grown.

51
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,110
I heard from Pinako...

52
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,490
...that you attempted human transmutation.

53
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,910
After all this time, why did you come back now?!

54
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,620
There's no place for you here anymore!

55
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,620
Oh, right.

56
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,920
Why did you burn down my house?

57
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,300
We decided we wouldn't turn back anymore.

58
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,720
We did it to show our determination-

59
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,930
That's not it.

60
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,930
You just didn't want to see it again.

61
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,680
You wanted to escape your horrifying memories.

62
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,850
You wanted to conceal all traces of the sin you committed.

63
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,860
That's not true!

64
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,480
You're no different from a child who hides
his sheets after wetting himself in his sleep.

65
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,740
You ran, didn't you, Edward?

66
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,160
What do you know?!

67
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,870
Damn it! You're sickening!

68
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,630
He's so similar to the way I was when I was young.

69
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,660
Father Before the Grave

70
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,720
You haven't changed at all.

71
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,510
Not even a bit from the old days.

72
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,100
Why didn't you come back sooner?

73
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,060
Trisha was always waiting for you.

74
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,200
Pinako.

75
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,120
Hm?

76
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,280
The thing my sons transmuted...

77
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,500
Was it really Trisha?

78
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,620
What?

79
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:03,750
I told you. It didn't even look remotely human.

80
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,300
I can't even call that thing Trisha-

81
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,420
No, that's not what I mean.

82
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,590
For example, the color of her eyes and hair.

83
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,060
What do you mean?

84
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,730
You're telling me that wasn't her?

85
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:26,900
You're telling me those boys lost their bodies by creating something that wasn't even their mother?

86
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,950
What?! You can continue to function without food or sleep?!

87
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,450
Yup, as long as this seal remains unscathed.

88
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,960
That's amazing! You're literally immortal!

89
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:41,830
That's not true.

90
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,380
My body is almost like a bomb.

91
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,340
I heard it from Barry.

92
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,800
It's impossible to place a soul that doesn't belong on a body.

93
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,260
If you force a soul on to one, it will eventually be rejected.

94
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,270
Whether that will be tomorrow or ten years later...

95
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,100
...even I don't know.

96
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,770
No way... then you have to find a way to get your body back as soon as possible!

97
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:14,530
Wait, if your body starts to deteriorate, can't you transfer your soul on to something else and continue to live?

98
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,990
If you do that, you can stay the way you are.

99
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:22,500
Without feeling pain or needing to eat!

100
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,290
What a convenient body!

101
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,130
Of course it's not convenient!

102
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,840
You don't even know anything!

103
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,340
Sorry.

104
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,550
Winry!

105
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
Winry?

106
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:46,980
I'm coming in.

107
00:05:53,990 --> 00:06:00,740
Geez... You and Brother always get mad before I ever can, so I never get to.

108
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,000
It's because....

109
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:13,590
It seems this body can't sleep...

110
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,680
Al...

111
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,690
You'll be able to return to your old body, right?

112
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:27,850
Right?

113
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,280
Give me back my brother's body!

114
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,660
He's... He's the only family I've got!!!

115
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:41,990
Give it back?

116
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,710
What are you talking about?

117
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:47,830
You're the one who put your brother in that state.

118
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,670
Alchemist.

119
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,750
That's right.

120
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,010
You and I are the same.

121
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,010
Edward Elric!

122
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,390
And...

123
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:07,310
Edward... don't leave me like this...

124
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,480
Ed! You still asleep?

125
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,900
Your dad's about to leave.

126
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,080
Can I take this?

127
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,460
It's the only one that has all four of us.

128
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,620
Help yourself.

129
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,960
Thanks.

130
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,340
As a token of my gratitude, I'll tell you something.

131
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,010
Something terrible will happen in this country soon.

132
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,720
Flee to another country.

133
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,640
That's not uncommon here.

134
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:54,020
And besides, there are kids who call this place home.

135
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,610
Don't say I didn't warn you.

136
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,910
Hohenheim.

137
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,160
Come back every now and then for a meal, won't you?

138
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,580
It's a shame, Pinako,

139
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,840
that I won't be able to eat your cooking anymore.

140
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,780
Are you really going to dig that thing up?

141
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Want to call it off?

142
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:54,330
No, it's just that my joints are starting to hurt.

143
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,170
Probably because it's about to rain. Let's get this over with.

144
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,150
Ed!

145
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,570
I told you so!

146
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,330
Let's stop this.

147
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,500
No...

148
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,630
If I don't confirm it, I'll never be able to move forward.

149
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,880
Also...

150
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,210
You ran, didn't you?

151
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,220
No way in hell am I going to run!

152
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,360
Granny.

153
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,650
Mom had auburn hair.

154
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,240
This is black.

155
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,120
The femur is way too long.

156
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,420
The pelvis... This is a man.

157
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,170
Granny.

158
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,630
Ed.

159
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,630
This is not your mother.

160
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:27,820
That's right. You cannot revive the dead.

161
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,200
That's a truth.

162
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,620
It was impossible from the very beginning.

163
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,540
Ed, pull yourself together!

164
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,420
Snap out of it!

165
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,420
I'm fine, Granny...

166
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,590
Since that day, this has been the symbol of despair.

167
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,100
But now, it will lead me to a path with hope.

168
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,190
Al can get his body back.

169
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,800
Hello, you've reached the Curtis'.

170
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,960
Oh, it's you, Ed.

171
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,920
What is it?

172
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:33,180
Umm... There was something I wanted to ask you...

173
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,600
Well...

174
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,220
What's wrong?

175
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,430
Speak clearly.

176
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:44,610
It's about the time you tried to revive your baby...

177
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,780
What about it?

178
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:56,030
Master, the person Al and I transmuted was not our mother.

179
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,710
What do you mean? What are you trying to say?!

180
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:04,960
The child that was created by your transmutation...

181
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,250
Are you sure it was your child?

182
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,690
I see...

183
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,980
So my son and his wife helped a lot on the battlefield, eh?

184
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,780
Good to know...

185
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,160
He...

186
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,910
Where did Hohenheim say he was headed?

187
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,790
Who knows? He didn't mention a word about it.

188
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,420
Oh, I completely forgot!

189
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,460
I had an important message for him.

190
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,720
Message?

191
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,680
Yeah.

192
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,850
Trisha's will.

193
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,180
Could you pass this on to him when he comes back?

194
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,400
Please tell him I couldn't keep my promise.

195
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,030
That I have to leave him first, and that I'm sorry.

196
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,900
A promise? What promise?

197
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,070
No idea.

198
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,780
Sorry to make you do this, but could you tell him for me if you see him?

199
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,290
Why do I have to do it?!

200
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:25,790
He may not look it, but he's actually quite worried about you two.

201
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,300
I'll deliver the message after I give him a good punch in the face.

202
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,550
Are you going back to Central?

203
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:38,300
Yeah, just to get yelled at by Al,

204
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,220
since I went and did a bunch of stuff without telling him.

205
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,850
What the hell is this?!

206
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,560
I'm sorry.

207
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,020
Y-You...

208
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,820
You're in ruins!

209
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,150
And...

210
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,450
What the hell are you guys doing?!

211
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,660
Eating.

212
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,500
Geez, just what happened to you?!

213
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,630
Homunculi and Barry the Chopper?

214
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:14,550
And on top of it all, a rejection reaction due to different souls and bodies, huh...

215
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,680
Stretching the armor that's left...

216
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,900
Al will be able to return to his old body, right?

217
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,360
Of course.

218
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,490
If I say I'll get his body back, I will.

219
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,540
Al...

220
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,710
I dug up the thing we transmuted back in Resembool.

221
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:55,130
W-Why did you do something like that?!

222
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:00,130
As a result, I discovered that what we transmuted wasn't Mom.

223
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,720
What? What does this mean?

224
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,020
But we...

225
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:12,230
We transmuted something completely different.

226
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,940
No way! Then I...

227
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:19,200
And now, I'm also confident we can get your body back.

228
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:20,950
Really?!

229
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,240
Yeah.

230
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,910
But before I get into that...

231
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:33,630
Y-You remember the time we fought over who'd be m-marrying W-Winry... right?

232
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,260
The thing we talked about up on the roof?

233
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,130
Yeah. So you turned Al down?

234
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,140
Yeah. I did.

235
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,470
And so, I have a question for you two.

236
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,640
Why did you turn him down?

237
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,980
"I don't want to marry a guy who's shorter than me."

238
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:58,190
Don't decide a man's worth by his height!!!

239
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:58,990
Huh?

240
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:02,530
Does this have anything to do with getting Al's body back?

241
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:10,580
To sum it up, if Al knows something I don't, and Winry remembers the same thing, too...

242
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,830
...it really happened.

243
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:19,420
Since he remembers something that really happened,
it means the soul affixed to that armor is the real Al's.

244
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:26,430
Even though I could only get your soul,
I was able to pull you back from that gate.

245
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:33,690
If I could pull your soul from the gate, then I should be able to get your body back the same way.

246
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,980
Separated from each other, the body and soul still exist....

247
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,690
Barry the Chopper!

248
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,030
Al, try to remember.

249
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:49,740
The time you were dragged into the truth.

250
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,250
That time...

251
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,920
That was me! I was there!

252
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,050
That's right. So all I have to do...

253
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,590
...is pull your body out like I did with your soul!

254
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:07,800
Brother!

255
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:15,270
I was watching you from that thing's point of view!

256
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,650
So it was you inside that thing?

257
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:24,450
The soul probably didn't affix due to the rejection reaction.

258
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:30,660
So we didn't damage anyone's soul...

259
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,580
Sir Elric.

260
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,040
Miss Izumi Curtis is on the line.

261
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,340
I looked into the family lineages of both my husband and me.

262
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,970
As a result, the skin and hair color of that child...

263
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:52,850
...cannot possibly have come from the two of us.

264
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,270
You were able to find something out, weren't you?

265
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,480
Yes.

266
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,020
Confidence that I'll be able to get Al's body back...

267
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,690
It's impossible to revive the dead.

268
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,490
I see...

269
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,740
It wasn't that I was missing something...

270
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:14,040
...but rather it was impossible from the very beginning.

271
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:16,870
Ed.

272
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,120
Yes, ma'am!

273
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:20,590
Thank you.

274
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,800
What did the master say?

275
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:32,890
I don't really get it, but she thanked me.

276
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,730
Al?

277
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:49,110
To be honest, I've been blaming myself nonstop since that day.

278
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,620
That it was me...

279
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,450
...who put Mom in that state and killed her.

280
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,370
Same goes for me, Al.

281
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,040
Thank you, Brother...

282
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:05,300
I didn't kill Mom!

283
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,720
Izumi.

284
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,890
I feel saved.

285
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,270
I didn't kill our child twice...

286
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,190
But it's true that I put you in that state.

287
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:29,400
I'm going to get your body back, no matter what-

288
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,320
Brother!

289
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,160
We carry the same sin, since I approved of the plan.

290
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,330
Please don't talk as though it's all your fault.

291
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,210
Trying to do everything by yourself...

292
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:46,050
I'm tired of other people having to suffer because of me!

293
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,550
Same with Mr. Hughes, too!

294
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,930
When I heard about his death...

295
00:20:54,470 --> 00:21:00,310
I felt from the bottom of my heart I didn't want to return to my body if other people would have to suffer.

296
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,110
Brother...

297
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,940
...even if they don't have the body of humans...

298
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,740
...I've been watching people who live according to the way they are.

299
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,040
Even if I'm in this state, people around me interact with me as though I'm human.

300
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:25,790
I know my body's like a bomb, but even a body made of flesh could die from accident or disease at any time.

301
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,420
So in order to live a normal life,
this body isn't all that inconvenient either.

302
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,800
I've truly started to feel that way.

303
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,390
But...

304
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,310
...I can't stand it any longer.

305
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,610
I'm... I'm...

306
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,820
...tired of spending nights by myself!

307
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,570
That's my reason for wanting to return to my old body.

308
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,870
Yeah, I'll make it happen.

309
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:05,170
After I beat the shit out of that "truth" guy, I'm going to drag your body out of there!

310
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,210
Yeah!

311
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,300
Huh?

312
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:23,980
Has he always had such a large back?

313
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:37,380
I don't have to act tough, right?

314
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:37,380
Tsuyogaranakute iindane

315
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:44,180
The scribbling someone made...

316
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:44,180
Dareka ga kaitetta

317
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:49,980
On the wall, of a flower is swaying.

318
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:49,980
Kabe no rakugaki no hana ga yureru

319
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,560
No one knows their true selves.

320
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,560
Jibunrashisa nante dermo wakaranaiyo

321
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,860
Even though we both lose and gain

322
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,860
Nagai nagai michi no tochuu de

323
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,280
By embarking on this long, long path,

324
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,280
Nakushitari hirottari

325
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:08,950
And though there may be days loneliness strikes and makes us weep...

326
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:08,950
Kyuu ni samishikunatte naichau hi mo arukedo

327
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:16,460
Let's transform our tears and pains to stars.

328
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:16,460
Namida mo itami mo hoshi ni kaeyou

00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:22,460
Let's light a candle to illuminate our tomorrow.

331
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,590
And we'll hold our small hands over the fire to create stardust,

332
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,590
Chiisana te kazashite futari de tsukurou

333
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:32,810
And an eternity that shines so brilliantly.

334
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:32,810
Hoshikuzu wo tsuyoku hikaru eien wo

335
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:38,190
Farewells may be unavoidable,

336
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:38,190
Sayonara itsuka wa kurukamoshirenai

337
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:44,110
Yet the seasons continue to change obliviously.

338
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:44,110
Kisetsu wa soredemo meguri megutteku

339
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,200
Chiisaku mayottemo aruiteku

340
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,200
Even if I lose myself, I'll continue to walk...

341
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,240
Walk by your side.

342
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,240
Kimi to aruiteku

343
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,540
That's the only thing I'd like to never change.

344
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,540
Sore dake wa kawaranaideiyoune

345
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,310
The figure of a wounded comrade hurries the man's steps,

346
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:11,110
and the boy risks everything he has to escape a dead end.

347
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:16,700
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

348
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,700
Advance of the Fool

349
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,700
Episode 21, Advance of the Fool.

350
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:25,660
You shall be the one to open fire.
