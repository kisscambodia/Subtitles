1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,150
The new morning we've finally found

2
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,150
Yatto mitsuketa atarashii asa wa

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,190
is being hampered by the past.

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,190
Tsukihi ga jama wo suru

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,660
What we chased after wasn't the future,

6
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,660
Mukau saki wa tsugi ja nakute

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,490
but the past so full of remorse.

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,490
Sugi bakari oikaketa

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,960
The ruthless memories won't stop playing;

10
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,960
Nariyamanai yousha nai omoide tachi wa

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,050
they won't be forgiving us for a long time.

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,050
Yurushite kuresou nimonai

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,890
It's about now that a teardrop

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,890
Sorosoro kana tesaguri tsukareta hoho wo

15
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,560
beings to roll down my fatigued cheeks.

16
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,560
Kattou ga koboreochiru

17
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,810
Will this rain ever stop?

18
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,810
Ame wa itsuka yamunodeshouka

19
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:52,030
I've been freezing for a long time.

20
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:52,030
Zuibun nagai aida tsumetai

21
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,320
Why does the rain continue to fix on me?

22
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,320
Ame wa doushite boku wo erabuno

23
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,080
I wonder if it could embrace me.

24
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,080
Tsutsumarete iikana

25
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,870
Today, the rain falls again;

26
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,870
Ame wa yamu koto wo shirazuni

27
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,090
endlessly it falls knowing no end.

28
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,090
Kyou mo furitsuzukukeredo

29
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,130
We nestle close to each other to share the warmth

30
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,130
Sotto sashidashita kasa no naka de

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:28,850
under this umbrella, you gently held out to me.

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:28,850
Nukumori ni yorisoinagara

33
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,820
Huh?

34
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,330
That's strange, I could have sworn it was this way...

35
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,450
No, was it that way?

36
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,460
Are you lost, Fullmetal?

37
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,670
Shut up!

38
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,460
We're lost because we came back to make sure that a certain incompetent moron wasn't doing anything dumb!

39
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,840
No one asked you to do it.

40
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,590
I'm surprised you can say that!

41
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,050
If Scar and I hadn't been there,

42
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,720
you definitely would have fallen from the right path!

43
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,640
Quit demanding my gratitude.

44
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,020
It's thanks to the Lieutenant that I was able to stop myself.

45
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,480
What did you say?!

46
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,980
They're so loud. We're going to be found by the enemy.

47
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,360
Scar, I'm going to go ahead and thank you while I still can.

48
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,910
For convincing the Colonel.

49
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,710
Although it would probably just anger you Ishbalans if you were to be thanked by someone like myself.

50
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,710
I think he was able...

51
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,550
...to return to his old self.

52
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,390
Thank you.

53
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,150
No need to thank me...

54
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,420
The Adults' Way of Life

55
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,660
Okay, roger!

56
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,330
Understood!

57
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,830
Hey! You can stop firing now!

58
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,750
Cease fire!

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,630
A message to the soldiers of the Central Army.

60
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,550
A message to the soldiers of the Central Army.

61
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,970
We, the Briggs forces, have occupied mission headquarters.

62
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,180
Damn those traitors...!

63
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,770
We are currently holding thirteen hostages, including Brigadier General Clemin.

64
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,230
I repeat.

65
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:33,230
We, the Briggs forces, have occupied mission headquarters.

66
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,770
We demand that the soldiers of the Central Army cease fire immediately.

67
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:40,360
We are currently holding Brigadier General Clemin hostage.

68
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,870
So the reason why you were going all flashy with the tanks was to mask the noise of the tunnel digging!

69
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,120
That's right.

70
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,840
What was that?!

71
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,210
I couldn't hear!

72
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,000
What?!

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,210
Is this true?!

74
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,340
What's the matter?

75
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,390
Mission headquarters has fallen to the Briggs soldiers!

76
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,680
Brigadier General Clemin has been taken hostage!

77
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,310
Mission headquarters!

78
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,680
Is Buccaneer there?

79
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,140
Captain!

80
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:17,440
There are a great number of these one-eyed blue humanoid monsters.

81
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,070
It takes a lot to kill them, and they also eat humans!

82
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,700
No matter what happens, keep all the gates closed!

83
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,830
You mustn't let a single one of them out into the city!

84
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,290
Annihilate them within the headquarters grounds!

85
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,210
Aye, ma'am!

86
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,800
What the hell is Clemin doing?

87
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,670
From here on out, I'll take charge!

88
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,180
This will be the new mission headquarters!

89
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,520
The Führer President's chair...

90
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,940
If we overcome this crisis, it'll be mine!

91
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,290
Still more of them?!

92
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,590
M-Major General, what the hell are these things?!

93
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,510
An immortal army, apparently.

94
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,050
They're soldiers that don't fear death,

95
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,600
made by affixing human souls onto dolls.

96
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,350
You soldiers will someday be turned into those.

97
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,700
That thing's still going to move?!

98
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,620
How much does it take to kill it for good?

99
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,740
Then here I go again!

100
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,630
What tenacity...!

101
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,920
Oh no!

102
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,470
Major!

103
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,760
Major General Armstrong!

104
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,390
Don't come!

105
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,270
It's after us only!

106
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,520
Stay away!

107
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,120
So stubborn.

108
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,660
I'm going to kill the female general!

109
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,210
Pull!

110
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,850
Keep it up!

111
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,480
Please, you two! Run away while you can!

112
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:02,940
This way! Hurry!

113
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,820
Now, Major!

114
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,400
Are you asking me to run...?

115
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,910
Are you asking me to run from the battlefield again?!

116
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:19,080
There's no way I could!

117
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,780
I like that resolve not to run.

118
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,490
You're quite handsome.

119
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:57,120
Well, not nearly as handsome as my husband, though.

120
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,910
Who are you?

121
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,170
Ah, the female officer.

122
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,540
Which means you must be Major General Armstrong.

123
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:12,420
Your subordinate with the mohawk asked me to come help you guys.

124
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,800
That was unnecessary of him...

125
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,430
This is such a drag...

126
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,200
Here he comes, Dear!

127
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,700
Gotcha!

128
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,130
Who might that gentleman be?

129
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,380
My husband.

130
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,190
Courage increased by hundred-fold,
muscles increased by thousand-fold!

131
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,560
Ouch...

132
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,740
He can still move?!

133
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,500
Am I... going to die?

134
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,300
Die...?

135
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,680
What does it mean... to die?

136
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,470
It's too much of a drag... to think.

137
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,350
Even living...

138
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:30,810
...is a drag...

139
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,490
Major!

140
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:43,780
Major!

141
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,260
All that's left are the skinny small fries!

142
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,510
Annihilate them with everything you've got!

143
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,220
Roger!

144
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,390
Sorry, I need to take a quick break.

145
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,440
Yes, ma'am!

146
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,850
Please leave the rest to us!

147
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,940
I don't know who you are,
but I very much appreciate your help.

148
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,860
You're welcome.

149
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,870
I assume you must be a famous martial artist.

150
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,290
Me?

151
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,450
No, no, I'm a housewife and an alchemist.

152
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:32,170
You've heard of the Elric Brothers, right?

153
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,630
I'm like a relative of theirs.

154
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,500
So you're Izumi Curtis?

155
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,420
Yup.

156
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,380
Are the Elric Brothers also here?

157
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,970
Yes, they should be.

158
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,560
Well then, I guess we should
take care of the rest of the dolls.

159
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,190
Can you stand, Sister?

160
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,940
This is nothing.

161
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,950
Hey hey, rest up a bit! You're heavily wounded.

162
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:12,120
Us adults can't just lie around while the young ones are fighting.

163
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:18,130
We have to show the young ones, the ones who will carry this world from now on,

164
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,470
the way we adults, the ones who currently carry this world, live our lives.

165
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,430
Then I guess we'll help out too!

166
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,180
That'll be wonderful!

167
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,640
Having you two on our side is equivalent to gaining one hundred men.

168
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:36,190
Nah... don't expect too much out of us.

169
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:40,030
I'm apparently a "human sacrifice" or something,

170
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:44,110
so I'm going to be getting out of here after I fight for a bit.

171
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,160
Before I get captured by someone really dangerous.

172
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,090
You're being so sullen even though we're in the middle of a heartfelt reunion?

173
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,100
You've gotten really boring.

174
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,850
You used to be pretty fun, with all those emotions.

175
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:28,950
Lust, greed, sloth, gluttony, envy, wrath, and pride.

176
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,290
They say that man has seven sins.

177
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,710
Too much greed would certainly destroy one's self,

178
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:43,550
but on the other hand, all of those emotions are absolutely necessary to understand other humans.

179
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,300
Why did you let go of them?

180
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,190
Geez, that was dangerous.

181
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,490
Listen to what I have to say!

182
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,580
You're kidding me!

183
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,040
Cut it out, man.

184
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,840
I'm not too good at fighting.

185
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,690
Answer me!

186
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:52,320
Why did you create the homunculi, keep them by your side, and have them call you 'Father'?!

187
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,210
Back when you were in the flask,

188
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,790
you used to even make fun of the community known as a family!

189
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:10,340
Could it be that you actually wanted a family like other humans have?

190
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,860
Where did he go?

191
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,910
Don't tell me he's going to hide until the
Nationwide Transmutation Circle activates?

192
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,960
It's not that I want to become human.

193
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,760
I want to become a perfect being.

194
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,840
I'm going to be taking...

195
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,470
...the philosopher's stone that's inside of you.

196
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,320
Finally, your expression changed.

197
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,540
What did you do?

198
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,170
Something you didn't do.

199
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,250
You probably won't understand.

200
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,760
You threw away something important along with your emotions.

201
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,890
Something important?

202
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:41,520
Don't even think you'll be able to defeat us easily.

203
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,770
God dammit!

204
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,440
This won't do.

205
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,150
The tire is completely stuck.

206
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,360
Look what you did, mustache boy!

207
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,700
The solar eclipse will begin if we take our time like this!

208
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,320
Shut up!

209
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,450
Hurry up and pull the car out!

210
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,200
Oh boy...

211
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,420
Doctor Marcoh, please back away.

212
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,210
Mr. Heinkel and I can handle it.

213
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,130
No, but...

214
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,260
It'll be fine. Just leave it to us.

215
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,680
Okay, here we go!

216
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,850
One, two, three!

217
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,240
Go surrender to the mission headquarters.

218
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,530
Hurry up and go.

219
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,700
Yes, sir!

220
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,070
Thank you very much!

221
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:44,160
Well, thanks to the dolls getting rid of so many central soldiers,

222
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,830
gaining full control of the place is a piece of cake.

223
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:58,510
We're going to keep up this pace and gain control of the main gate.

224
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,680
Aye, sir!

225
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,860
Looks like there's not much for us to do...

226
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:16,860
You!

227
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,030
Damn you!

228
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,240
Why?!

229
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:24,580
Weren't you made to listen to our orders?!

230
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,040
Was that man lying to us?!

231
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,540
S-Stay away!

232
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,710
I wasn't meant to die here!

233
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,400
I don't know who you are, but good work.

234
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,360
Be my bodyguard.

235
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,320
If you do, I'll specially-

236
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:07,000
Mind telling us about "that man" whom you speak of?

237
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,470
This is gruesome.

238
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,060
Will you take command from here?

239
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:35,020
I don't understand how someone could sit in a place where they'd make such an easy target for a sniper.

240
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,270
Let's go.

241
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,440
Roger!

242
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,860
Sister.

243
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,280
Where does this passage lead to?

244
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,580
Seems like it goes down pretty deep.

245
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,130
Could it be the hole which the dolls came out of?

246
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:57,380
If so, it could lead underground.

247
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,420
Yes.

248
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,670
Okay, understood.

249
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,090
Madam!

250
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,970
Buccaneer and his men have captured the main gate.

251
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:08,310
There was little resistance, and they sustained only minor damage.

252
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,430
The entrance to the main gate has also been seized.

253
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:13,560
They've stationed the tanks there and are using it as a primary defensive position.

254
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:17,520
The Buccaneer squadron shall stay on stand-by.

255
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:24,320
Please be sure not to open the gate until every single one of the dolls have been exterminated.

256
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,820
Roger that.

257
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,620
This is the west gate.

258
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,990
We, the white squadron from Briggs, have taken control of the place.

259
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,250
This is the north gate.

260
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,120
Black squadron, taken control!

261
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,250
Blue squadron, taken control of the east gate.

262
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,710
Yellow squadron, we've seized their arsenal!

263
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,720
It's just as you hear, Major General Armstrong!

264
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:45,970
The Briggs Army has gained control of 90% of Central Headquarters.

265
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,510
Victory is ours.

266
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,980
We won!!

267
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,200
Looks like the Colonel didn't make it in time.

268
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,410
Hip hip, hooray!

269
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,870
Hip hip, hooray!

270
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,290
Hip hip, hooray!

271
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,840
Hip hip, hooray!

272
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,300
Hip hip, hooray!

273
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,670
Did you miss me?

274
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:32,680
Seems like you guys started a party while I was away.

275
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:38,440
From here on out, I myself will take command and annihilate the traitors.

276
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,730
I order all unengaged central soldiers to lend me a hand.

277
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,570
King... Bradley...?!

278
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,780
So he was alive.

279
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,240
Where?!

280
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,830
Where will he attack from?!

281
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,300
Salute the Führer President!

282
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,800
Ano hi kara zutto

283
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,800
Ever since that day passed,

284
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,050
I promised myself that I'd never cry.

285
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,050
Nakanaito kimetekitakedo

286
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:51,600
But even while I hoarded up the pain,

287
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:51,600
Itami wo kasanetemo

288
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,710
there was something I couldn't forgive myself for.

289
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,710
Nanika wo yurusezu ni ita

290
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,150
I'll never be able

291
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,150
Mou modorenai

292
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,650
to return to those days.

293
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,650
Ikutsumo no hibi

294
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:07,740
I'm still powerless.

295
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:07,740
Boku wa mada nanimo dekizuni

296
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:12,990
I watch as the shards of memories disappear, one by one;

297
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:12,990
Kimi no ita kioku no kakera

298
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:18,860
memories of when you were still with me.

299
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:18,860
Mata hitotsu kieteyuku

300
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,880
I long to become

301
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,880
Kyou yori motto

302
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,630
Tsuyoku naritai

303
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,630
stronger than I am now,

304
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:29,770
so that my voice will eventually reach you.

305
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:29,770
Kono koe ga itsuka todokuyouni

306
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,140
If the wind happens to stop

307
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,140
Arukitsuzukete

308
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,850
in the midst of my long journey,

309
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,850
Kaze ga yandara

310
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:39,560
I'll look up at the sky in search of you.

311
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:39,560
Kimi wo sagashite sora miageruyo

312
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:46,900
Yoake no saki ni hikari ga sasuyo

313
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:46,900
Beyond the daybreak, a ray of light breaks free.

314
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:52,450
A rainbow spans across the sky.

315
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:52,450
Niji ga kakaruyo

316
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,580
The king's sword brings about destruction, death,

317
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,750
waste, and despair.

318
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:10,130
He devastates all that stands in his way with unmatched power.

319
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:16,140
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

320
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:20,660
Episode 56, The Return of the Führer

321
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,660
The Return of the Führer

322
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:26,650
His home is the battlefield.
