1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,150
The new morning we've finally found

2
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,150
Yatto mitsuketa atarashii asa wa

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,190
is being hampered by the past.

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,190
Tsukihi ga jama wo suru

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,660
What we chased after wasn't the future,

6
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,660
Mukau saki wa tsugi ja nakute

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,490
but the past so full of remorse.

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,490
Sugi bakari oikaketa

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,960
The ruthless memories won't stop playing;

10
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,960
Nariyamanai yousha nai omoide tachi wa

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,050
they won't be forgiving us for a long time.

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,050
Yurushite kuresou nimonai

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,890
It's about now that a teardrop

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,890
Sorosoro kana tesaguri tsukareta hoho wo

15
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,560
beings to roll down my fatigued cheeks.

16
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,560
Kattou ga koboreochiru

17
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,810
Will this rain ever stop?

18
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,810
Ame wa itsuka yamunodeshouka

19
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:52,030
I've been freezing for a long time.

20
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:52,030
Zuibun nagai aida tsumetai

21
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,320
Why does the rain continue to fix on me?

22
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,320
Ame wa doushite boku wo erabuno

23
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,080
I wonder if it could embrace me.

24
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,080
Tsutsumarete iikana

25
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,870
Today, the rain falls again;

26
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,870
Ame wa yamu koto wo shirazuni

27
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,090
endlessly it falls knowing no end.

28
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,090
Kyou mo furitsuzukukeredo

29
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,130
We nestle close to each other to share the warmth

30
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,130
Sotto sashidashita kasa no naka de

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:28,850
under this umbrella, you gently held out to me.

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:28,850
Nukumori ni yorisoinagara

33
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,070
What's the matter?

34
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,160
The soldiers outside want to start negotiating.

35
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,540
We're only sending one man! He's on his way now!

36
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,500
Be sure not to shoot!

37
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,420
Hands above your head!

38
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,670
Do anything suspicious and we won't hesitate!

39
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,630
He's fine.

40
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,100
Let him through.

41
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,720
He's someone we can trust.

42
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,500
Second Lieutenant!!

43
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,010
I wonder if there's any way for me to see my husband right now...

44
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,090
You mustn't!

45
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,550
There's no telling what could happen to you.

46
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,230
There's still a chance that the army is currently under control of the anti-Bradley faction.

47
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,850
Please be patient for a little longer.

48
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,560
I see...

49
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,150
You're right.

50
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,260
Eye of Heaven,
Gateway of Earth

51
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,710
So, you say you refuse to acknowledge Truth?

52
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,000
That's exactly right!

53
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,250
You also seem to think you've won
after gathering all the human sacrifices,

54
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,380
but you won't have your way with us so easily!

55
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,760
Nonsense.

56
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,220
Can you stand? We're going to get out of here.

57
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,470
Don't bother trying.

58
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,020
All of you are already inside my belly.

59
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,070
What on earth is this?

60
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,870
Is the 'Father' guy inside of that thing?

61
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,910
He should be with our father by now.

62
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,080
Though I certainly can't guarantee that he is with no physical defects.

63
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,220
May!

64
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,130
Midget!

65
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,680
Hey you, with all the eyes! You're immortal, aren't you?

66
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,770
So you're not going to deny it.

67
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,560
Sir Alphonse, let me handle him.

68
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,070
H-Hey, you won't be able to take him on alone!

69
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,820
Nope, I can use Eastern Alchemy.

70
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,370
I get that you'll still be able to use alchemy even after he seals it off, but...

71
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,410
I'm going to need you two to take on the little homunculus.

72
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,130
Easier said than done...

73
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,470
He forced the colonel to open the gate...?

74
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,640
Then why didn't he do that to begin with?

75
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,850
Fullmetal.

76
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,770
When he dragged me into the transmutation,

77
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:03,030
he said, "I didn't really want to have to use this method, but we're fairly short on time."

78
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,820
Meaning it carries a great risk for them.

79
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,870
Probably.

80
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,620
Guess it's worth a shot.

81
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,210
All right! We can use alchemy!

82
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,880
He's running?!

83
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,260
He used to always avoid them using his shadows!

84
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,510
We may have a chance!

85
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,760
Right!

86
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:35,520
Messing up my house again? You evil kids.

87
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,650
Your immortality is mine!

88
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:54,450
You don't belong here.

89
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,540
Out!

90
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,300
Watch out, little girl!

91
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,590
He can transmute without-

92
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,600
May!

93
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,700
Just what on blazes is going on?

94
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,700
We still can't get in touch with headquarters.

95
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,080
Reporting in!

96
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,870
Several Ishbalans have appeared within the city!

97
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,500
They've engaged in combat with the guards in-

98
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,250
You-

99
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,630
My apologies.

100
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,300
We don't really have the time to explain.

101
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,420
Forgive us.

102
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,270
No! No!!

103
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,270
Help me! Someone, help me!

104
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,100
My apologies, lady.

105
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,230
We mean no harm, so please tell us...

106
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,690
This is the house located here on this map, right?

107
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,790
It's starting to get really dark.

108
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,080
I wonder if everyone's doing their job...

109
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,750
You sure this is the right place?

110
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,960
Yeah, positive.

111
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,050
Great.

112
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,090
Now...

113
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,510
The rest is up to you, Scar.

114
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:46,690
It's nice to be face to face with death every once in a while.

115
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,530
Right now, the only thing in my mind is the fact that I'll fight to the death with you.

116
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:01,160
Social status, career, origin,

117
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,670
race, gender, name...

118
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,460
...none of that matters.

119
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:15,140
Not being bound by anyone and fighting just for the sake of it.

120
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,640
How astounding.

121
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,400
I've finally reached this stage.

122
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,200
What's wrong?!

123
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,080
Is this all you've got?!

124
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,000
That's not enough!

125
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,540
Hardly enough!

126
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:52,970
Destroy me, nameless one!

127
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,190
You look surprised.

128
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,480
I don't blame you.

129
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,610
If you were to ask me some time ago,

130
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,700
even I wouldn't have imagined that I'd be using something like this.

131
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:08,420
I had always been thinking about what I was capable of doing.

132
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,460
And this was the conclusion I'd reached.

133
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:19,260
It's the transmutation circle of reconstruction that I obtained from my brother's research documents!

134
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:26,020
You humans just continue to struggle.

135
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,950
May!

136
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,070
Shit!

137
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,790
Al, you go help May.

138
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,950
What about Pride?!

139
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,080
Leave him to me.

140
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,790
I can take him!

141
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,630
Roger that!

142
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,890
Little girl!

143
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:12,690
You keep your mouth shut, Hohenheim.

144
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,700
Sir Alphonse...

145
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,750
What's the matter now?

146
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,960
Those are some weak blows!

147
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,470
Don't get the wrong idea.

148
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,390
Until you perform your duty...

149
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,680
You need to keep me alive, eh?!

150
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,020
Then I'll just kick both of your asses before that happens!

151
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,430
"Kick our asses"?

152
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,140
Do try.

153
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:56,900
Since you have a small stature, you've always been fighting against people larger than you.

154
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:01,570
Thus, you have little experience fighting against those who are smaller than yourself!

155
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,700
I apologize beforehand if I hit you, Dad!

156
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,050
You little...!

157
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,640
I do admit that I've always been fighting against people who were bigger than me!

158
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,680
And that's exactly why...

159
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:34,650
...I know how little guys tend to attack!

160
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,150
Master!

161
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,820
Transmuting with no movement? That's kind of annoying.

162
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,660
It's almost time.

163
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,730
Playtime ends here.

164
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:23,150
Time for you all to get to work.

165
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,000
It's pitch dark...

166
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,920
Hurry...

167
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,250
Hurry and take us to the middle of the transmutation circle...

168
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,590
Hurry!

169
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,720
We can't stay here!

170
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,340
Quit throwing a fit!

171
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,890
Hurry up and take me to the center!

172
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:50,930
Hurry!

173
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,100
We're going to get devoured!

174
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,640
Hurry!!

175
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,160
The time has come!

176
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:32,100
Have you all ever thought of this planet as one life form?

177
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:39,390
Well, it would be more accurate to call it a system rather than a life form.

178
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:45,400
A system that records a tremendous amount of information taken from the universe,

179
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:49,910
which is incomparable to the tiny amount that each of you humans possess.

180
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,910
If one were to open that gate,

181
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,950
how much power do you suppose they would gain?

182
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:59,580
Ever thought of it?

183
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:06,420
I'm going to open that gate here and now
using these human sacrifices!

184
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,680
So that's the center!

185
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,390
Greed!

186
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,900
The center of the world belongs to me!

187
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,070
The world is mine!

188
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,070
He did it.

189
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,250
I knew you'd come, Greed, my son.

190
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:47,800
You're the avarice that was born from me.

191
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:53,930
It's only natural that you'd want everything I'd want.

192
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:00,680
Ed!

193
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,090
The true center of the world...

194
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,050
...is right here!

195
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,730
Damn you...!

196
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,510
W-What's going on?!

197
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,770
This is...!

198
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,770
That's right, allow the gates to fight each other!

199
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,690
Repel one another!

200
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,520
What an immense amount of energy!

201
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,440
I'm almost unable to hold it down by myself.

202
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:25,500
And with this power, I shall open the gate of the planet!

203
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,990
What on earth?!

204
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,760
Win...ry...

205
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,720
What's... going on...?

206
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,270
Miss Pinako, what's...

207
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,730
Hohenheim... I'm going to punch you...

208
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,360
...when you come back...

209
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,820
Ed...

210
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,120
E... d...

211
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:24,840
God!!

212
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,350
Respond to my soul!

213
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,220
Come!

214
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,870
That's right, come!

215
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,790
I shall no longer be chained down by You!

216
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:08,800
I shall drag You down to earth and make You a part of me!

217
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,800
Ever since that day passed,

218
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,800
Ano hi kara zutto

219
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,050
I promised myself that I'd never cry.

220
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,050
Nakanaito kimetekitakedo

221
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:51,600
But even while I hoarded up the pain,

222
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:51,600
Itami wo kasanetemo

223
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,710
there was something I couldn't forgive myself for.

224
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,710
Nanika wo yurusezu ni ita

225
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,150
Mou modorenai

226
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,150
I'll never be able

227
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,650
to return to those days.

228
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,650
Ikutsumo no hibi

229
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:07,740
I'm still powerless.

230
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:07,740
Boku wa mada nanimo dekizuni

231
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:12,990
I watch as the shards of memories disappear, one by one;

232
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:12,990
Kimi no ita kioku no kakera

233
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:18,860
memories of when you were still with me.

234
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:18,860
Mata hitotsu kieteyuku

235
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,880
I long to become

236
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,880
Kyou yori motto

237
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,630
stronger than I am now,

238
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,630
Tsuyoku naritai

239
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:29,770
so that my voice will eventually reach you.

240
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:29,770
Kono koe ga itsuka todokuyouni

241
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,140
Arukitsuzukete

242
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,140
If the wind happens to stop

243
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,850
in the midst of my long journey,

244
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,850
Kaze ga yandara

245
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:39,560
I'll look up at the sky in search of you.

246
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:39,560
Kimi wo sagashite sora miageruyo

247
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:46,900
Beyond the daybreak, a ray of light breaks free.

248
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:46,900
Yoake no saki ni hikari ga sasuyo

249
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:52,450
A rainbow spans across the sky.

250
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:52,450
Niji ga kakaruyo

251
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,790
Bow before him, humans, if he is who you call a god.

252
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,760
But if you do not acknowledge him so, fight!

253
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,380
Stake thy pride.

254
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:16,640
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

255
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,160
Episode 61, He Who Would Swallow God.

256
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:21,160
He Who Would
Swallow God.

257
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:25,860
"God" is an invention of those with nobody else to turn to.
