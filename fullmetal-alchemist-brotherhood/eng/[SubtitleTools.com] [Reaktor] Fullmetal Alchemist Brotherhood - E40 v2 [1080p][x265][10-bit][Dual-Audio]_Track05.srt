1
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:23,460
We sigh whenever we're about to come to a standstill

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:23,460
Owarinaki tabi no tochuu tachidomarisouna toki

3
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,710
While moving on this endless journey.

4
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,710
Fukai tameiki kobosu bokura wa

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,430
Everytime we lunge for it, it escapes and flies off.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,430
Tsukamikaketewa mata hanareteitta

7
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,850
But now, there's nothing to be afraid of

8
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,850
Demo ima wa mou nanimo osoreru koto wa nai

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,780
The powerful ties that bind our hearts

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,780
Kokoro wo tsunagu tsuyoi kizuna wa

11
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,240
Will never come loose.

12
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,240
Keshite hodoke wa shinai sa

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,960
After a lifetime of searching, we finally arrived

14
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,960
Sagashitsuzukete tadoritsuita

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,760
Here, where the period lies.

16
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,760
Kono basho de piriodo ni

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:23,060
Let's change all our sorrow and rage to power.

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:23,060
Kanashimi ikari chikara ni kaete

19
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,980
Destiny is right within our reach.

20
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,980
Unmei wa sugu soba ni

21
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,860
So you're suggesting Major General Armstrong had a hand in Lieutenant General Raven's disappearance?

22
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:39,990
Most likely.

23
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,580
But I'm sure she left no evidence.

24
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,000
You're right.

25
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:50,210
Ah, well. Our job is to take over this fort...

26
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:55,300
...while that fox is being investigated in Central by a herd of tigers.

27
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,390
Oh, if it isn't the Major General.

28
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,810
I still can't believe you were transferred to Central.

29
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,190
What connections did you use?

30
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,820
I believe it's simply an honest display of my capabilities.

31
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,400
Says the fresh meat.

32
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,820
What brings you here today?

33
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,370
I've been summoned by the Führer President.

34
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,740
I may not be able to return to Briggs for a while.

35
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,290
"For a while"?

36
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,500
Then I'm going to have to take you to dinner at least once.

37
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,630
Is it your treat?

38
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,170
If you'll let me eat until you go bankrupt, I don't mind going for dinner.

39
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,630
I guess I'll give up on the meal, then...

40
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,970
Both your wallet and your balls are pea-sized, I see.

41
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,180
How about some flowers instead?

42
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,100
There are many great florists in Central, after all.

43
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:51,650
I see.

44
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,150
You may enter.

45
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,150
Yes, sir.

46
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,170
Now, Major General Armstrong...

47
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:16,550
...let me hear more about
Lieutenant General Raven's disappearance.

48
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,800
What did you do?

49
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,470
I won't be able to hide this.

50
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:28,810
Why would a man as great as you choose to place a fool like Raven by his side?

51
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,440
So you got rid of him?

52
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,150
You don't need him.

53
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:39,360
Having a subordinate with such a loose tongue would do you no good.

54
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,570
What did Lieutenant General Raven tell you?

55
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,450
Something about an immortal army...

56
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,910
...the history of this country, and your real identity.

57
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,830
He told me many things I didn't even ask for.

58
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,090
So you still chose to respond to
my summons after hearing all that?

59
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:03,300
Yes, to request the seat the idiot had been placing his ass on.

60
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,060
Interesting, as expected of you.

61
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,690
Very well. You may have the position.

62
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:18,690
In exchange, I'll have one of my men govern over Briggs. Are you fine with this?

63
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,900
As you wish, sir.

64
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,450
They are powerful soldiers I trained with great care.

65
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,070
I'm sure you'll like them.

66
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,830
Interesting. Do your best, human.

67
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,670
"Nothing ventured, nothing gained."

68
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,970
So the Major General ventured into the enemy's lair by her own will.

69
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,470
Yeah. This place also belongs to them now.

70
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,100
But they're unaware...

71
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:59,940
...Briggs is a giant monolith that can act with a united will, even if its master happens to be away.

72
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,740
From here on, it's a war between bears and tigers.

73
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,260
Homunculus
(The Dwarf in the Flask)

74
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,540
Is that seat free?

75
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,670
Yes.

76
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,250
How's your work progressing?

77
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,800
As you can see,

78
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,630
I can't finish everything unless I multitask during my meals, as well.

79
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,800
And you?

80
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,560
There's so much to memorize; I'm fairly busy.

81
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,190
But the Führer President does his job very quickly, so I do not have to worry about that.

82
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,690
He doesn't loaf either, unlike a certain someone.

83
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,360
I have a feeling this topic is heading in a direction I don't like.

84
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,370
That reminds me...

85
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,000
Scar is apparently up north.

86
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,290
So are the Elric brothers.

87
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,210
I see.

88
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,300
My old classmates, Lucy and Ian, are also up north.

89
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,930
They tell me many things.

90
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,060
If I recall, the north and the east will be holding joint exercises in the spring.

91
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:19,690
Yes, we've been defeated countless times by Major Miles and Captain Buccaneer.

92
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,770
Miles... Buccaneer...

93
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,570
York, Ida, and Sugar, too.

94
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:35,700
Havoc, Oscar, Mike, Uni, Nora, Charley...

95
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,080
Uni again, then Lucy...

96
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Uni comes again, then next... is Sterling!

97
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,010
"Selim Bradley is Homunculus".

98
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,720
I guess there's no way that can't  be true.

99
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,400
Just what is about to happen here in Central?

100
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,280
Boy.

101
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,500
Hey, you over there.

102
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,210
Oh, crap!

103
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,710
Don't worry.

104
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,840
Over here.

105
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,670
What the hell?

106
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,130
Come on.

107
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:34,590
Aren't you at least a little surprised?

108
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,060
If I do get surprised, will you give me something?

109
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,560
I guess you're always at ease. I like you.

110
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,600
What's your name?

111
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,400
Slave Number 23.

112
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,400
I didn't ask for a number. I want your real name.

113
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,820
I don't have a name. I'm a slave.

114
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,030
Slave?

115
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:58,080
People who are stripped of their rights and freedom, and are exchanged as possessions in conveyance?

116
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,200
Conveyance?

117
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,250
To transfer property and rights and such.

118
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:07,250
You're not very bright, are you?

119
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,590
Shut up!

120
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:13,300
I don't understand how I was born from someone like you.

121
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,220
You're the one who gave me blood, aren't you?

122
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:23,060
They did take a lot of blood from me to use for experiments...

123
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,770
I was born because you gave me blood.

124
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,860
Thank you. Umm...

125
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,320
"Slave Number 23" just sounds too cold.

126
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,660
I'll give you a name, then.

127
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,530
Who the hell do you think you are?

128
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:43,410
Don't you want a cool name? Let's see...

129
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:47,880
Teo... Teofrastus Bombastus.

130
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,880
Too long.

131
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,260
Ah, it can't be too long; else you won't be able to memorize it. You're dumb, after all.

132
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,470
Quit saying that!

133
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,760
Then how about Van?

134
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,810
Van Hohenheim.

135
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,770
Van Hohen, eh?

136
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,560
I should be able to remember that.

137
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,190
You spell it like...

138
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,940
Wait, do you know how to read and write?

139
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,780
I don't need to know to work.

140
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,610
The work of a slave, right?

141
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,370
Don't you want freedom and rights?

142
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:25,250
Do you plan on ending your life as a slave without gaining basic human rights?

143
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,170
That's the same as being in this stuffy flask.

144
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,380
I'm going to share my knowledge with you, Van Hohenheim.

145
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,310
Hey... What are  you?

146
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,560
What should I call you?

147
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:51,730
The Little One Inside the Flask. So... call me "Homunculus".

148
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,210
All was created from one, and it eventually returns to one.

149
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,710
In other words, one is all.

150
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:15,380
All exists due to one...

151
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,800
...and all exists within one.

152
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,470
If one does not contain all, then there exists nothing.

153
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,140
You pass.

154
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:28,730
You're now a fine alchemist, Hohenheim.

155
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,060
I'm still not good enough to be on my own.

156
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,570
My abilities are far beneath yours, Master.

157
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,320
You know, I'm really thankful.

158
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,740
For what?

159
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,950
Because you gave me knowledge,
I'm able to live a good life like this.

160
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,620
I'm also happy to be in Master's favor.

161
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:53,630
It may be possible that I can marry someone in the future and start my own family.

162
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,960
A family, eh?

163
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,210
Humans are inconvenient creatures, aren't they?

164
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:02,970
The species can't live on unless they all create a community and expand.

165
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,850
Don't talk like that.

166
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:10,480
It may be stupid in your eyes,
but having friends and family...

167
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,190
...may bring one happiness.

168
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,900
For us humans, that is.

169
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,690
Really?

170
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,240
Then what do you consider happiness?

171
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,200
Let's see...

172
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:28,950
I don't want to be too greedy, but I guess being able to leave this flask would make me happy.

173
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,010
Immortality...

174
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:45,680
I wonder why fools who gained ultimate authority and prosperity begin to wish for that.

175
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,010
Mind your tongue!

176
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,720
You're talking to the King!

177
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,730
If you continue to be disrespectful, I'll break the flask!

178
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:56,610
You're going to destroy the source of the knowledge you don't know about?

179
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,610
Cease your prattling.

180
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,610
Can you make me immortal or not?

181
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,990
Growing impatient as you age, huh?

182
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:09,160
How sad, King of Xerxes.

183
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:16,040
Fine, I'll tell you how to achieve immortality.

184
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,920
What's with the construction?

185
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,800
We're making a waterway for irrigation.

186
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,600
The King ordered a waterway to extend around the entire country.

187
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,060
Nothing less to be expected from the King of Xerxes.

188
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,640
He even thinks about commoners like us.

189
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,890
That's right.

190
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,740
Kill them all. Understood?

191
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,650
Yes, sir!

192
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,630
Hurry! Waste no time!

193
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,340
Hurry and carve a bloody crest into the land!

194
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,100
The village to the north was raided?

195
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,680
I heard everyone there was killed.

196
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,310
And the same thing happened in the village to the west last time.

197
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,940
I wonder who's behind it...

198
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,060
How terrible.

199
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,980
Yeah, how awful.

200
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:44,960
Your Majesty, the transmutation circle is finally complete.

201
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:50,220
Truly, it has been a long time.

202
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,770
This is all we need to do, right?

203
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,850
Yeah, you'll be able to become immortal.

204
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,870
That's amazing.

205
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,880
The King is going to become immortal.

206
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,090
I guess it's what they call the turning point of the century.

207
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,190
So this is immortality...

208
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,740
What's this?!

209
00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:00,040
You said that since we're in the center of it, we wouldn't be harmed!

210
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,630
What?

211
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,840
What's happening?!

212
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,630
Hey! Homunculus!

213
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:17,430
The true center of the transmutation circle is where you're standing right now.

214
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,270
What?!

215
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:23,560
I opened the gate using your blood inside of me.

216
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,320
You're a relative that shares my blood, Hohenheim!

217
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,990
Right now, you and I are at the center of the world!

218
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,190
Your Majesty!

219
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,900
Master!

220
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,120
He's dead.

221
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,170
Is anyone here?!

222
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,170
Willard!

223
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,090
Mechthild!

224
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,920
Linemile!

225
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,510
Tony!

226
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,340
Meiyou!

227
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,030
Please... Someone, say something.

228
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:36,610
It's no use. Everyone has had their souls taken from them.

229
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,070
Your Majesty!

230
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,040
You were all right...

231
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,040
So...

232
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,000
...How do you like your new body?

233
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,460
It's... me...

234
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:57,340
I created a body for myself using
the information stored in your blood.

235
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:03,220
Finally, I can walk with my own two feet.

236
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,270
You're... Homunculus?

237
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,900
What is this?! What did you do?!

238
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:15,900
In return for you giving me blood, I gave you a name and shared my knowledge with you.

239
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,160
I also gave you an eternal body.

240
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,830
Eternal?

241
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:26,250
Try focusing all of your consciousness into yourself.

242
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,790
Can't you hear the voices?

243
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:39,630
The voices of all the people, who lived in this country, sacrificed for your immortal body.

244
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,890
Well, half of them went to me.

245
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,890
Thanks for your help, Hohenheim.

246
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,990
Mr. Hohenheim?

247
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,780
It really is  you!

248
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:15,000
Wow, I didn't know you were Ed and Al's father.

249
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,170
I didn't expect you to be the master of my sons, either...

250
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,470
I hear you did a lot for them.

251
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,550
No, not at all.

252
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,430
Miss Izumi?

253
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,600
Are you all right, Izumi?!

254
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,020
I'll get your medicine...

255
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,390
Let me take a look at her.

256
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,730
I know a thing or two about medicine.

257
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,570
Don't worry, this isn't anything new.

258
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,950
This is certainly something to worry about.

259
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,950
Mr. Sig, please get a cab.

260
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:50,750
Hurry!

261
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,460
R-Right!

262
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,960
Miss Izumi...

263
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,300
You saw the truth, didn't you?

264
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,050
What did you sacrifice?

265
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,680
Please don't try to hide it.

266
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,940
They took a few of my organs.

267
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,400
I tried to revive my dead baby.

268
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,950
I see.

269
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,450
I see...

270
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,910
If you'll excuse me.

271
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,140
Izumi! Hang in there!

272
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,390
Izumi!

273
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,350
Calm down, Dear. I'm fine.

274
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,150
You were stabbed in the stomach!

275
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:00,480
But I can breathe more easily now.

276
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,150
Show me your wound.

277
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,200
There's no wound.

278
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,740
That can't be!

279
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,080
The organs that were taken are the proof of your sins, so I can't bring them back.

280
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,170
But I rearranged your insides a bit to ease the flow of blood.

281
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:23,550
Miss Izumi, you can't die just yet.

282
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,840
Hohenheim...

283
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,300
Just... what exactly are  you?

284
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:37,980
I'm a human by the name of Van Hohenheim...

285
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,020
A philosopher's stone in human form.

286
00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:00,210
The promise we never made

287
00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:00,210
Kawashita hazu no nai yakasoku ga

288
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,000
yet again

289
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,000
Kyou mo

290
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,840
Bokura no mirai wo ubaou to suru

291
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,840
tries to snatch our future away from us.

292
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:11,430
Why is it that we can't rejoice

293
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:11,430
Hoshigatteita mono wo te ni shitemo

294
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,430
straight from the heart

295
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,430
Sunao ni

296
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:17,390
when we obtain something we've always been after?

297
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:17,390
Umaku waraenai nowa nazedarou

298
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:23,110
The overflowing tears aren't from feebleness or remorse.

299
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:23,110
Afureru namida wo yowasa ya koukai ja nai

300
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:27,900
They're fragments born from agony.

301
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:27,900
Itami ga unda kakera de

302
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,950
Of all the moments and destinies,

303
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,950
Donna shunkan datte unmei datte

304
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:41,710
I realized there's one absolute certainty.

305
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:41,710
Hitotsu dake tashika na mono ga aru to shitta

306
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,250
Even if things get tough and I'm at my limit

307
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,250
Genkai datte konnan datte

308
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:48,260
I refuse to give up.

309
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:48,260
Akirametakunaiyo

310
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:53,140
Konomama hanasanaide

311
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:53,140
Please, don't let go.

312
00:22:53,140 --> 00:23:00,980
I can feel the warmth of your right hand

313
00:22:53,140 --> 00:23:00,980
Kataku nigirishimeta kimi no migite no nukumori

314
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,650
where it's tightly joined with my left.

315
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,650
Koko ni arukara

316
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:16,450
The Philosopher's Stone,
the Heavenly Stone, the Great Elixir.

317
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:19,460
Just like how the philosopher's stone has many names,

318
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,750
its form isn't always that of a stone.

319
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:26,170
The one Doctor Marcoh had was almost like a gel.

320
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:31,260
Kimblee's looked like a crystal, and it was about this big.

321
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:35,760
Since it possesses so much energy, I pictured something far larger...

322
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,560
I've never seen one bigger than a pebble.

323
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,940
If it's something even larger, that would mean an enormous number of humans was used to create it.

324
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,240
I'd rather not see one.

325
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:03,250
If one wishes to gain something,
one must present something of equal value.

326
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:07,170
