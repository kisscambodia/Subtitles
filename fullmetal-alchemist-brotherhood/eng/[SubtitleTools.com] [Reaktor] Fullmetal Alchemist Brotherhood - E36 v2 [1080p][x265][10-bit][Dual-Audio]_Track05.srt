1
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:05,980
Donatus.

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,430
Poswell.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,890
Linemile.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:09,980
Johnny.

5
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,020
Colin.

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,310
Tony.

7
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:13,730
Willard.

8
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,230
Ripley.

9
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,440
Mechthild.

10
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,530
Meiyou.

11
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,990
I'm sorry... I need to use you.

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,400
Family Portrait

13
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,410
13 Years Ago

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,770
Why don't you just give them a pat?

15
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,640
They're your kids, aren't they?

16
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,270
I don't want them to become monsters like me.

17
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:57,030
Geez, if it were something you could "catch" like a cold, I would have become one a long time ago.

18
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:03,660
I've witnessed many deaths since gaining this body.

19
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:11,290
But I was able to suppress the sadness by telling myself that death is just a speck in the grand scheme of things.

20
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:18,590
Whenever I'd witness something beautiful or wondrous, I'd accept this body, thinking it'd give me time to see them all...

21
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,550
That's how it's always been for me.

22
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,310
Until I met you and had kids, Trisha.

23
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:34,810
I never age, but I'm watching
my kids age and grow like trees...

24
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,820
I'm terrified all of a sudden.

25
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,860
It reminds me that I truly am a monster.

26
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,790
Dear!

27
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,330
Dear, come here for a second!

28
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,250
What is it?

29
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,250
Good day, sir.

30
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,380
A photographer?

31
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,210
Try to look nice, now.

32
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,220
We've never taken a family portrait before, have we?

33
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,050
But this is so sudden...

34
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,730
Hold on to Ed.

35
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,610
Okay...

36
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,440
We're ready now.

37
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,530
Please take the picture.

38
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,530
I don't like this...

39
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,540
Face this way, please.

40
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,660
Don't move, okay?

41
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,290
You know... someday, I'll turn into a wrinkled old woman who looks like a monster.

42
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,180
But no matter how I end up looking, I'll always be happy to take a picture with the family where everyone is smiling.

43
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,300
So please... stay with your family.

44
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,430
Don't distance yourself from us and leave us alone.

45
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,810
Don't hurt yourself by saying you're a monster.

46
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,070
Okay! Say cheese!

47
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,320
Smile, Dear.

48
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:23,510
I was planning to accept this body and continue living like this.

49
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,470
But I've changed my mind.

50
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:35,560
I want to age and die with Trisha and the kids.

51
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,150
That bastard...

52
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,120
That should do it...

53
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,710
What were you doing up there?

54
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,540
Fixing the swing.

55
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,630
You're not really used to these things, are you?

56
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,670
I couldn't do a single thing for them, so I wanted to at least do this.

57
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,930
Trisha, I'm going.

58
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,470
Please wait for me.

59
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:18,440
Okay.

60
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,940
Don't tell the kids about my body.

61
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,110
Sure.

62
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,070
Don't you want to say goodbye to them?

63
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,200
If I see their faces, I'll...

64
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,290
You blockhead. It's okay if you cry.

65
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,090
H-Hey, why are you two up so early?

66
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,880
Al says he needs to go pee...

67
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,050
Oh, so you were looking after Al.

68
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,010
Thank you, Ed.

69
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,140
Just a bit longer.

70
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,870
Can't focus. My body is still puzzled about what to do.

71
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,870
Shuuchuu dekitenaina mada karada ga mayotteirunda

72
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,630
I'm trembling. I can't stop even if I try to control myself.

73
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,630
Furueteitanja kontoroorushitatte burerunda

74
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,380
Taiyou mo tsuki mo nanmo kanzen ni kocchi muiteinaiga

75
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,380
Although neither sun nor moon are on my side,

76
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,800
"I've no choice but to try,"

77
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,800
Yarushikanainda

78
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,470
Those were the words I muttered to myself.

79
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,470
Iikikaseruyouni sotto tsubuyaita

80
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:04,060
The odds aren't on my side, but running way'd be gutless.

81
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:04,060
Joukyou wa waruiga tada nigedasunja konjou nainaa

82
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,060
Even if I can't see the future, I'll just have to win it over with courage.

83
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,060
Tenbou wa naiga dokyou de kuria suru shika naiya

84
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,560
Need to keep distance from the target as I hold myself back.

85
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,560
Shoudou wa osaetamama taagetto to no kankaku sagure

86
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,860
Hitsuyou na mon wa katsu puraido

87
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,860
All that's needed for victory is pride to win.

88
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,950
Will we celebrate with the wine of victory

89
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,950
Ajiwau nowa shouri no bishu ka

90
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:21,950
Or'll we end up kissing their feet in defeat?

91
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:21,950
Soretomo haiboku no kujuu ka

92
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,700
There are two outcomes to everything.

93
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,700
Sou subete wa futatsu ni hitotsu

94
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,420
I want to control destiny.

95
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,420
Ayatsuritai unmei no ito

96
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,750
I need to seize the golden opportunity with my hands.

97
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,750
Zekkou no goorudentaimu kono te de tsukame

98
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,840
I'll finish it up with my best poker face,

99
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,840
Konshin no pookaafeisu kimete shikakeruyo

100
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,800
Iryuujon no sekai e hikizurikonde

101
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,800
And drag them into a world of illusions.

102
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,140
I'll find my way out of this endless pressure game,

103
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,140
Saigennai puresshaageemu sururito nukete

104
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:54,150
And leap over the borderline of honor.

105
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:54,150
Eikou no boodaarain tobikoeru tameni

106
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:58,860
How many? What'll I need to sacrifice to make it happen?

107
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:58,860
Haumenii? Dorekurai no daishou ga iru?

108
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,120
What is the one thing I don't want to let go?

109
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,120
Tebanashitakunai mon wa dore?

110
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,270
Any luck?

111
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,240
No, I still can't reach them.

112
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:17,160
This isn't good... we can't contact the guys at base.

113
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,700
What now? Should we keep going?

114
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,080
There should be an exit somewhere to toss the rubble that was dug out.

115
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,250
Let's keep going for just a bit.

116
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,210
Smith, you go back to report on the situation.

117
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:28,830
Roger!

118
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,090
What's wrong?

119
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,220
Spread out!

120
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:21,220
Are you interested in a perfect, immortal army?

121
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,890
He fell for it!

122
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,770
No death, no decay...

123
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,270
Aren't you interested?

124
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,190
I want to cut him to pieces!

125
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,320
It's just that the idea is so wild; I don't know how to respond.

126
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,820
There are only two choices:
You're either interested, or you're not.

127
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,990
I'm intrigued.

128
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:53,710
So when that day comes, not just I,
but my men will also be able to benefit from this?

129
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,840
When that day comes, yes.

130
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,470
So he can't guarantee that much, huh...

131
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:06,010
If I accept their offer, they'll force me to assist them in causing a bloodbath at Briggs.

132
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,980
And if I decline, they'll put someone else in charge of the base, and I'll most likely be demoted or reassigned.

133
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,980
Now, I wonder what my best option is...

134
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,490
Pardon me.

135
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,030
What is it?

136
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,240
I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am!

137
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,740
The advance unit that went into the underground tunnel-

138
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,330
What about the underground tunnel?

139
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,170
It's okay. Say it.

140
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:32,620
Roger.

141
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,340
Something has happened to them.

142
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,460
Understood. I'll be right there.

143
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,630
I'll go, too.

144
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,340
All right, let's move.

145
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,550
Hang on!

146
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,060
We'll need to be tied up, right?

147
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:56,940
What's all this, Buccaneer?

148
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:02,150
I'm currently transferring the Elric Brothers from the east cells to the west cells, sir!

149
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,030
Who is that gentleman, if I may ask?

150
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,410
Solf J. Kimblee.

151
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,290
He's Lieutenant General Raven's guest.

152
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:12,160
Kimblee... So he's the Crimson Alchemist.

153
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:17,040
The Elric Brothers... So you must be the Fullmetal Alchemist.

154
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,670
Now I see why you were given that name.

155
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,220
Oh... it's you.

156
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,180
It's been a while since anyone's made that mistake!

157
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,180
Nice to meet you, Fullmetal Alchemist.

158
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,270
Likewise.

159
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,270
General!

160
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,360
What happened?

161
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,150
We've lost contact with the platoon that went to investigate the tunnel.

162
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:48,580
And soon after, Smith's horse came back with an arm presumed to be his.

163
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,120
Just his arm?

164
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,330
What about his body?

165
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,000
Missing, ma'am.

166
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,380
The horse he was on is too worked up
and can no longer be used.

167
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,460
Henshel, send in a rescue party imme-

168
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,420
This isn't good, Major General Armstrong.

169
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,340
That hole is far too dangerous.

170
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,600
What did you do with that biological weapon you were talking to me about?

171
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,480
Put him back into the tunnel and
cover up the hole, Major General.

172
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,860
But our men are still-

173
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,230
I'm talking to the Major General.

174
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,440
Isn't that the law here?

175
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,200
Obey the ones with power, Major General Armstrong.

176
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,750
I'm Raven from Central.

177
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:43,000
I've heard everything from the Führer President.

178
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,380
Pleasure to meet you.

179
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:47,130
It seems you've been keeping your mouths shut.

180
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,680
We promised, after all.

181
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,800
You don't seem too happy.

182
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,140
Wouldn't it be strange to be happy after having people taken hostage?

183
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,810
Umm... when can we get out of here?

184
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,730
The deal was that we'd be able to continue
our journey as long as we didn't get in your way.

185
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,860
Don't worry, I'll get you out of here soon.

186
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,740
That hole... it's also a part of your plan, isn't it?

187
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,370
If they find out...

188
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,450
You don't need to worry about that, either.

189
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:22,000
Major General Armstrong agreed to returning
the Homunculus in the tunnel and sealing the hole.

190
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,380
The Major General joined forces with us, too.

191
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,140
General!

192
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,060
Aren't we going to search for the missing unit?

193
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,310
Silence, Henshel.

194
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:38,270
But they may still be alive and need assistance!

195
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,690
I said, silence!

196
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,560
Shut up and obey.

197
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,450
"Obey the ones with power", eh?

198
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:53,870
So even the impregnable "Northern Wall of Briggs" has to give in to authority.

199
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,950
Well, that's the smart approach to things.

200
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,010
Oh? So that's the...

201
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,890
Good morning, Sloth.

202
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,600
Did you sleep well?

203
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,560
Who are you?

204
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,480
I'm still sleepy...

205
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,650
Hey, now. You still have some work to do.

206
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,150
Didn't Pride tell you so?

207
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,150
Pride?

208
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:35,160
It's a drag... but I have to do it...

209
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,460
What a drag...

210
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:44,040
Why was it a drag again?

211
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,300
Trying to remember is a pain...

212
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,680
No need to worry.

213
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,310
He's a chimera that's performing a task for the Central Army.

214
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:02,810
He's working to make this country stronger.

215
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:06,190
But it's still a top-secret mission.

216
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:10,690
Now, cover up this hole, my friends at Briggs.

217
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,530
You all are kindred spirits who I've shared my secrets with!

218
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:32,300
The essential parts have been replaced with ancient Ishbalan, so I can't read it.

219
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,130
I guess we can't help that, huh...

220
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,720
If Scar were here, we might be able to figure it out.

221
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:41,730
If he's an Ishbalan monk, there's a chance he'd know the ancient language.

222
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,900
I wonder if something happened to Mr. Scar?

223
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,110
We've found her!

224
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,030
A little girl carrying a black and white cat!

225
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,700
Okay, let's move.

226
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,040
Mr. Scar! Sir Yoki!

227
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,920
Did you find the research documents?

228
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,300
Yes, we did!

229
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,920
Let's switch locations.

230
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,260
The soldiers from Briggs have already found this place.

231
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,430
Hurry.

232
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,800
A Few Days Later

233
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,270
This is fine.

234
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:31,570
We, the chosen ones, will be granted a body close to God's, and we'll rule this world.

235
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,190
Was his name Smith?

236
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,070
Nothing can be done about the advance unit.

237
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,740
So the weak should become victims for the chosen ones to survive?

238
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,620
That's right. Survival of the fittest.

239
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:49,880
The weak become the foundations of a nation, and the strong prosper above them.

240
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,300
So Ishbal was also...

241
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,550
That's right.

242
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,090
Ishbal was also a part of our plan.

243
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,800
Those weak people were destined to be destroyed.

244
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,430
I see.

245
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,480
Please leave that to me.

246
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:06,940
Yes, sir.

247
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,810
Sorry for the wait.

248
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,990
You certainly make a lot of phone calls, don't you?

249
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,030
Where is Lieutenant General Raven?

250
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,660
I have something to tell him.

251
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:31,420
You were on the verge of death, but you somehow managed to make a recovery on the same day.

252
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,590
What kind of magic spell did you use?

253
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,340
Don't worry about it.

254
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:41,090
And besides, you were jailed for killing officers. How did you manage to get out?

255
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:44,720
I told you, don't worry about it.

256
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,350
Since when has this plan been in motion?

257
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:51,560
I've heard it's been in motion since this country was created.

258
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,280
And it'll finally be complete during my generation.

259
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:59,360
I thank you for your cooperation, Major General Armstrong.

260
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,320
I'll negotiate with the higher-ups and prepare a seat for you.

261
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:05,700
No need.

262
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,870
What?

263
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,750
Was that Smith's left arm? Or his right?

264
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,880
W-What are you...

265
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,220
Aging is truly horrifying, isn't it, Lieutenant General Raven?

266
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:28,270
I'm sure you used to be a young, dignified soldier who loved this country from the bottom of his heart.

267
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,180
Y-You...

268
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,310
You have the chance to become a chosen one...

269
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,730
I promised you a seat...

270
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,400
There's no need for another seat.

271
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,910
I'll be taking the seat your rotten ass has been sitting on!

272
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,330
You useless geezer!!!

273
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,500
Immortality... is right in front of you...

274
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,010
You can lie there and literally become a foundation of this base, Lieutenant General Raven.

275
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:08,220
I wanted... to become immortal...

276
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,640
Buccaneer, contact Miles.

277
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,390
Yes, ma'am!

278
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,730
Everyone else, continue working as if nothing's happened!

279
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,730
General.

280
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:17,360
Thanks.

281
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,240
Smooth the concrete, got it?

282
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,240
Roger.

283
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,780
You're being very pushy.

284
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:32,160
Is it because I'm a State Alchemist who served in the Ishbalan War?

285
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,790
What can I do to satisfy you?

286
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:39,460
Do you want to know what kind of deaths your people experienced?

287
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,760
Shut up, Kimblee.

288
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,880
Don't you want to know?

289
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,880
I told you to shut up!

290
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,760
Do you have a moment, Major?

291
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,770
I have a message from Major General Armstrong.

292
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,690
She says, "Mission complete.
You don't need to buy any more time."

293
00:18:58,690 --> 00:18:59,900
Roger.

294
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,980
Good grief.

295
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,530
Finally, I'm relieved from talking with that freak.

296
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:07,280
Even though I was putting on an act, it was exhausting.

297
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,660
Kimblee.

298
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,450
Apparently, Lieutenant General Raven is missing.

299
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:16,040
Do you happen to know where he'd be?

300
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,250
Missing?

301
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,000
This isn't good.

302
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,050
The base isn't built safely enough for people to just walk around.

303
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,180
If something happens to the Lieutenant General-

304
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,180
That's good for me.

305
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:38,150
I received permission from the Führer President to act independently if something happened to Lt. General Raven.

306
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,030
Could you drive me down to the base of the mountain, Major Miles?

307
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,450
Do you understand?

308
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:51,450
My orders right now hold equal importance to those of the Führer President's.

309
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,790
Please wait, General!

310
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:00,380
Before you cover the hole completely, please send in a search squad for Smith and the unit...

311
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:07,300
The Fullmetal Alchemist created a secret passage in case a situation like this arose.

312
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,720
She killed him?!

313
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,180
Lieutenant General Raven?!

314
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,600
Well, that's all I needed to tell you.

315
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,440
Hey! Wait!

316
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,940
When the hell are you guys going to let us out?!

317
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,940
Who knows? Ask the Major General.

318
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,780
Dammit...

319
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,030
Getting impatient won't do us any good, Brother.

320
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,450
It's more important to rest for now...

321
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:34,950
I can't stay put when so many things are going on!

322
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,420
Hey, how's it going?

323
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,800
I've come to speak with the Fullmetal Alchemist-

324
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:50,180
Oh? It seems as though I'm not very popular here.

325
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,720
I've brought a guest today for you two.

326
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,060
A guest?

327
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,480
You idiot!!!

328
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,730
Why did you come here?!

329
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,900
"Why"?!

330
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,900
To switch your automail to the kind they use up here, of course!

331
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,150
Why are you guys in jail, anyway?!

332
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,740
No one called you out here!

333
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,370
What the heck is your problem?

334
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,160
I was so worried about you!

335
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,000
I wouldn't have known if the people from the military hadn't told me about it!

336
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,000
The military?!

337
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,000
Come on, you two.

338
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:25,500
The Führer President was very worried to hear of the situation.

339
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:38,770
Even if we part and meet again, I want to meet at this place.

340
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:38,770
Megurimeguttemo mata koko de aitai

341
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:45,700
Then we'll hold hands to ensure we'll never be separated again.

342
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:45,700
Hagurenaiyouni kono te wo tsunagunda

343
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,330
We used to talk all night until the sun rose,

344
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,330
Asahi ga noboru made katariattane

345
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:51,160
And held hands till the sun went under the horizon.

346
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:51,160
Yuuhi ga shizumu made tsunaida te

347
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:56,410
Let's walk together like this forever, like light and shadow.

348
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:56,410
Kouyatte asu mo asatte mo tomo ni ayumou hikari to kage

349
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,960
I stand in the city, staring off into space with lonely eyes.

350
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,960
Samishige ni mitsumeru machi no naka de

351
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,300
I can't find warmth on my own.

352
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,300
Nukumori wa hitori ja mitsukaranakute

353
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:11,810
By meeting you, I realized

354
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:11,810
Ai ga konnani tsuyosa ni narukoto

355
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:17,640
How much strength love could give me.

356
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:17,640
Shittanda kimi ni deaete hajimete

357
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,900
Even if we part and meet again, I want to meet at this place.

358
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,900
Megurimeguttemo mata koko de aitai

359
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:28,200
Then we'll hold hands to ensure we'll never be separated again.

360
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:28,200
Hagurenaiyouni kono te wo tsunagunda

361
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,410
I can't sleep by myself, 'cause I can't dream without you.

362
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,410
Hitori ja nemurenai yume wa mirenaikara

363
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:39,170
Donna fuan mo todokanai tokoro e

364
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:39,170
So take me to a place where uncertainty can't reach us

365
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:44,420
And let us bring light to the night sky with no stars.

366
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:44,420
Hoshi no yoru mo terashitsuzukeyou

367
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,920
So long as you're with me, I can go to world's end.

368
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,920
Doko made mo yukeru kimi to nara

369
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,930
Even if it's a path I can't walk on my own,

370
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,930
Hitori ja arukenai michi mo futari nara

371
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,970
If you're by my side, I can walk it while humming a tune.

372
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,970
Hanauta utainagara arukerunda

373
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:56,390
If we're together, the world is mine.

374
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:56,390
Kimi ga ireba shiawase

375
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,350
Kimblee?

376
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,560
Yeah.

377
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,020
I heard from a friend who works as a nurse at the foot of Briggs.

378
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,230
He was hospitalized with serious injuries,

379
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:12,690
but his wounds were healed right after Lieutenant General Raven came to visit, and he was released right away.

380
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,780
Raven and Kimblee...

381
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,990
That's about all the information I have for today.

382
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,530
Thanks.

383
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,910
I'll ask for your help again when I need it.

384
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,500
Stop by at the shop again, okay?

385
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,050
You were dumped, eh?

386
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,720
Why don't you buy some flowers and chase after her?

387
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,130
I know when to give up.

388
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,640
I'll pass.

389
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,970
There are women who will dump you, but there are also women who are looking for a match.

390
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,390
I have a message from
Major General Olivier Mira Armstrong,

391
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,980
Colonel Roy Mustang.

392
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,610
I'll be buying all of those flowers.

393
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:03,480
The chain binding them appears in unusual form.

394
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:07,480
Boy, unbind the chains and wrench them off.

395
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,900
Reel it in and expose the enemy.

396
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:15,990
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

397
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:20,990
The First Homunculus

398
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:20,990
Episode 37, The First Homunculus.

399
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,410
Stratagems and blackmailing.

400
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:26,330
Those are the measures taken to fulfill one's desires.
