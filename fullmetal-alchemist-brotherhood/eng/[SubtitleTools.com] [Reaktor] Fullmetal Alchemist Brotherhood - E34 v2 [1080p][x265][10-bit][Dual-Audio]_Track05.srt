1
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,870
Can't focus. My body is still puzzled about what to do.

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,870
Shuuchuu dekitenaina mada karada ga mayotteirunda

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,630
I'm trembling. I can't stop even if I try to control myself.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,630
Furueteitanja kontoroorushitatte burerunda

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,380
Although neither sun nor moon are on my side,

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,380
Taiyou mo tsuki mo nanmo kanzen ni kocchi muiteinaiga

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,800
"I've no choice but to try,"

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,800
Yarushikanainda

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,470
Those were the words I muttered to myself.

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,470
Iikikaseruyouni sotto tsubuyaita

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,060
The odds aren't on my side, but running way'd be gutless.

12
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,060
Joukyou wa waruiga tada nigedasunja konjou nainaa

13
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,060
Even if I can't see the future, I'll just have to win it over with courage.

14
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,060
Tenbou wa naiga dokyou de kuria suru shika naiya

15
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,560
Need to keep distance from the target as I hold myself back.

16
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,560
Shoudou wa osaetamama taagetto to no kankaku sagure

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,860
All that's needed for victory is pride to win.

18
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,860
Hitsuyou na mon wa katsu puraido

19
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,950
Will we celebrate with the wine of victory

20
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,950
Ajiwau nowa shouri no bishu ka

21
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,950
Or'll we end up kissing their feet in defeat?

22
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,950
Soretomo haiboku no kujuu ka

23
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,700
There are two outcomes to everything.

24
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,700
Sou subete wa futatsu ni hitotsu

25
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,420
Ayatsuritai unmei no ito

26
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,420
I want to control destiny.

27
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,750
I need to seize the golden opportunity with my hands.

28
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,750
Zekkou no goorudentaimu kono te de tsukame

29
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,840
I'll finish it up with my best poker face,

30
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,840
Konshin no pookaafeisu kimete shikakeruyo

31
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,800
And drag them into a world of illusions.

32
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,800
Iryuujon no sekai e hikizurikonde

33
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,140
I'll find my way out of this endless pressure game,

34
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,140
Saigennai puresshaageemu sururito nukete

35
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,150
And leap over the borderline of honor.

36
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,150
Eikou no boodaarain tobikoeru tameni

37
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,860
Haumenii? Dorekurai no daishou ga iru?

38
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,860
How many? What'll I need to sacrifice to make it happen?

39
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,120
What is the one thing I don't want to let go?

40
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,120
Tebanashitakunai mon wa dore?

41
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,110
S-Superficial?

42
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,120
In other words, chilblains.

43
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,540
You were close to getting frostbite.

44
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,460
If you walk around in a blizzard for
a long time with an automail like that,

45
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,170
you'll get frostbite where it is connected to your body.

46
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,040
You also won't be able to move very well unless you change your oil.

47
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,670
Is that Buccaneer guy's automail made differently?

48
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:06,680
It's no good, Doc. I can't get this helmet off.

49
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,930
Hey! That's my head!

50
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:17,440
All automail here must be made to be flexible, lightweight, and resistant to cold.

51
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:24,950
So through trial and error, an automail made with duralumin, carbon fiber, nickel, and copper was developed.

52
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,990
I thought it was just made of iron.

53
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,330
No wonder I couldn't destroy it.

54
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,170
Hey Doc, you're not planning on spilling all the beans, are you?

55
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,460
Why, what's wrong?

56
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,290
He's a famous State Alchemist.

57
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,590
Are you sure he's real?

58
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,590
He has the silver pocketwatch.

59
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,390
A guy like this is of equal standing to a major?

60
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,850
If you're planning on staying up north for a while, you should switch to a cold climate automail.

61
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,100
Where does your automail mechanic work?

62
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,520
Rush Valley.

63
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,030
They knew a customer was heading up north and didn't even bother to tell you the dangers or offer a replacement?

64
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,490
Well... I didn't tell her that I was going to be up here.

65
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,910
If you don't want to die, you need to get it replaced;
even if it means your mechanic has to take a trip here.

66
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,620
Fine.

67
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,420
That'll be 100 cenz for the coffee.

68
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,250
What a cheap trick...

69
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,050
And this coffee tastes worse than the one at Eastern Headquarters.

70
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,670
Your fault for letting your guard down.

71
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:32,180
So? What did you come here to do with that normal automail of yours?

72
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,310
Coming along without even passing through Headquarters.

73
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,640
That's right!

74
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,690
We came here with a letter of introduction to see if Major General Armstrong could help us out,

75
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,610
but that general didn't even listen to me and was
blabbering on about how she'd pluck my antenna off...

76
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,400
Did you call, little brat?

77
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,450
"L-Little"...

78
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,240
What is it?

79
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,910
If you've got something to say, just say it.

80
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,410
M-My hair...

81
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,920
I look ridiculous...

82
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,950
Ice Queen

83
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:15,060
So... I hear you're on good terms with my little brother, Alex.

84
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,060
Is he doing well?

85
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,180
Yeah.

86
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,270
As muscular as always.

87
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,810
He's as cheerful as can be.

88
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,480
"Tch"?!

89
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,030
Nevermind that.

90
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,990
Moving right along, tell me why you came to see me without going through Headquarters first.

91
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,780
Don't forget to include why that armor is empty, as well.

92
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,210
It's actually... something I don't want a lot of people to know about.

93
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,370
You've got nothing to worry about.

94
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,880
Most of the people here have circumstances of their own.

95
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,210
It's not uncommon for us to have things we don't want others to hear, as well.

96
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:53,300
It's the kind of thing that could get me
court-martialed if people were to find out...

97
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,680
I've done things of that caliber, as well.

98
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,100
Brother, listen.

99
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,270
I don't think she'll forgive us unless we tell her something.

100
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,560
But Winry is practically a hostage.

101
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,020
I have an idea.

102
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,480
Let's leave out the part about the
Führer President and the Homunculi.

103
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,900
What are you whispering on about?!

104
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,990
I don't have all day!

105
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:15,370
Then I guess we can just tell her,
"We're on a journey to get our bodies back".

106
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:29,500
I see. So that's why you're looking for a girl who carries this cat around.

107
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,420
I get it now.

108
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,220
Then will you help us-

109
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:41,350
I get you are scatterbrains who act without thinking and end up adding fuel to flames because of your carelessness.

110
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,350
I don't want to keep fools like you in my castle.

111
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:49,360
Seriously... why don't the higher-ups at Central keep fools like you chained up?

112
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,110
Leave here at once!

113
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,950
...is what I'd like to say, but I'm highly interested in Eastern Alchemy.

114
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:02,870
You two are acquainted with that girl from Xing, right?

115
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,870
Yeah, I guess you could say that...

116
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,210
It's technology we don't have in this country.

117
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,380
I want it.

118
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,260
You can never have enough technology.

119
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:15,380
Especially in this land, where we frequently combat Drakma, a large nation.

120
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,640
Depending on how we apply it, Eastern Alchemy may become a useful combat tool for us.

121
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,890
Hang on!

122
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,350
Eastern Alchemy is especially versed in medicinal purposes.

123
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:24,890
Using that for war-

124
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,230
Did I give you permission to speak?

125
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,440
You're nothing but dogs that do nothing but bark within the borders of the country.

126
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:35,700
Don't you forget for a second that you fools are living in peace because there exist those who protect the borders.

127
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,530
I am in charge of protecting the northern border.

128
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,950
If the technique would be useful to my duty, then I'll take it. Whatever it may be.

129
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,170
Leave the search for the little girl to us.

130
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,790
I don't want you two out of the fortress.

131
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,090
And Major Miles.

132
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:53,840
Ma'am?

133
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,300
Give these two some work to do.

134
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,090
W-What?!

135
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,590
"If a man will not work, he shall not eat."

136
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,220
Can't argue with that...

137
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:07,100
They've got quite a rough history behind them.

138
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:13,610
Although they seem to be fairly experienced in combat, I now know that they're just brats on the inside.

139
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,110
Also...

140
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,610
It seems like they have some secrets they're not willing to share with us.

141
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,920
Hey, what are you going to make us do exactly?

142
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:38,550
The doctor said that a lot of people here have
circumstances of their own. Does that go for you, too?

143
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:45,350
So you ask us about every detail of our lives,
and now you're ignoring us? Talk about unfair!

144
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,350
Do you really want to know?

145
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,110
Red eyes?!

146
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,110
An Ishbalan?!

147
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,740
Why...

148
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:02,530
I heard that all of the soldiers of Ishbalan descent were purged before the extermination...

149
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:07,200
I do have some Ishbalan blood in me.

150
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,830
However, my grandmother, my father, and my wife do not.

151
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:17,260
The colors of my skin and eyes came from my grandfather.

152
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,470
Amestrian...

153
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:25,510
You sure had your way with
the land of my ancestors, didn't you?

154
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:40,280
You Ishbalans burned down my hometown, too, and even killed my friend's parents.

155
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,780
Cut it out, Brother!

156
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,880
Sorry about that.

157
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,750
You're actually the first one who talked back after I said that.

158
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,170
You were testing me, weren't you?

159
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,800
I apologize.

160
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:07,010
It's just that people view me with pity after that civil war.

161
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,310
To be honest, I was getting sick of it.

162
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,810
But you were different.

163
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:19,320
Well, I've met Ishbalans who wanted to kill me, ones who tried to kidnap me, and others I've made peace with.

164
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,490
So I've been through a lot.

165
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,580
And besides, I believe it's possible for individuals to be able to talk as equals without having to worry about race.

166
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,220
Were you enlisted in the military during the extermination, Major Miles?

167
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,220
Yeah.

168
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,390
I served as assistant to Major General Armstrong then, too.

169
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:52,100
The extermination began as soon as I was stationed here,

170
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,480
and all of my Ishbalan relatives, beginning with my grandfather, were killed in the East.

171
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,900
My life was saved due to my narrowly missing the requirements of the purge statute.

172
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,900
Did you not come to despise the military?

173
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,910
You don't hesitate to ask anything, do you?

174
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,700
I hate being ignorant.

175
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,660
I apologize if I offended you in any way.

176
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,580
A State Alchemist being ignorant, huh...

177
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,470
I did despise what the military did.

178
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:29,550
And at the same time, I had doubts about the
Major General for keeping me as her assistant.

179
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:36,480
By having someone like me, a person with Ishbalan blood around, it could cause trouble with the soldiers here.

180
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:41,940
Yet, the Major General didn't exile me,
so I turned on her in anger and demanded answers.

181
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,740
Briggs shall not fall, no matter what happens.

182
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:54,200
Every soldier here must be strong and flexible, fulfilling my every command.

183
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,750
They must make up a sturdy army that would keep calm under all circumstances.

184
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,090
In other words, there's no time for racism.

185
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:12,470
Because the blood of many races runs through your veins,
you view this country from many angles and with many values.

186
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:19,020
Because I was born and raised an Amestrian, I need someone like you by my side for me to be able to stand at the top.

187
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,770
Follow my command without complaint, Miles!

188
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,530
Perfectly logical.

189
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,740
Not to mention that her words carried no deception.

190
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:35,370
I proceeded to ask her, "Even then, what if the Ishbalan in me couldn't forgive the army and took over my mind?"

191
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,750
How do you think she responded to that?

192
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,000
Very well. Bring it on.

193
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,250
I'll accept a duel from you at any time, as a representative of the army.

194
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,670
Is what she said.

195
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,550
What an evil woman.

196
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,760
It should be easy saying that with a battalion at her back.

197
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,760
No, I'm fairly certain...

198
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,890
I'll slice you up in a one-on-one duel!

199
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,680
...her eyes were saying that.

200
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,110
Are you aware of the universal law at this base?

201
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,280
"Survival of the fittest", was it?

202
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,530
That's right.

203
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:10,280
Ones without power will die,
and ones with power will survive.

204
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:14,580
This is always true, under any circumstances.

205
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,040
It's very simple.

206
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:21,460
There are no underlings, bosses, and no distinctions between race, ethnicities, and gender.

207
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,720
There's a good example of the survival of the fittest concept.

208
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,130
You lived through it because you had good luck.

209
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:36,010
Looks like the guys who were supposed to be removing the icicles loafed on the job.

210
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,020
It's your job now.

211
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,520
I'll tell one of my men to give you
a tour of the inside once you finish.

212
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,860
I can't reach that high!

213
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,490
Huh? Don't tell me...

214
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,240
Warrant Officer Falman!

215
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,780
Elric Brothers!

216
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,450
What are you doing here?

217
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,870
Speak for yourself! I thought you were getting transferred to Northern Headquarters!

218
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,380
I was actually sent here from Northern Headquarters.

219
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,420
You were promoted to Second Lieutenant!

220
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,380
Yeah.

221
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,090
Oh. Congratulations on your promot-

222
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,510
But why are you in charge of the icicles?

223
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:15,970
If you're here working the duties of the enlisted...

224
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,890
Looks like that'll be your last promotion.

225
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,770
Shut up!

226
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,230
This is the development lair.

227
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,150
Wow, what's that?

228
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:36,660
They're developing weapons using the best technology in the country under orders from Major General Armstrong.

229
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,330
Even automails for combat?

230
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:39,950
Yes.

231
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,080
Let me show you something else.

232
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,010
This is the lowest level of Briggs.

233
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,340
It's really warm down here.

234
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,760
Totally different from how it is up at the top.

235
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:00,350
The lifeline of the fortress is gathered here.

236
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:04,890
Even if the top of the fortress is attacked,
the central part underground will remain unscathed.

237
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,480
Out of my way!

238
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,530
Don't be milling around!

239
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:11,860
Sorry.

240
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,110
Hey Bobby, this way!

241
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,320
It's this pipe.

242
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,370
This sound...

243
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,790
It's coming from underground.

244
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,130
What?!

245
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,880
It sounds like... someone's digging.

246
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,300
Don't tell me the Drakmans are building
an underground passage beneath the fortress?!

247
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,470
It's really close!

248
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,010
What a drag...

249
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,640
Really, what a drag...

250
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,230
It's such a drag, I could die.

251
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,400
But dying is also a drag.

252
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,130
Solf J. Kimblee?

253
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:19,470
He was badly injured on a freight train on the way here and was hospitalized at the foot of the mountain.

254
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,140
He requests that Briggs supports him.

255
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,020
Wasn't the Crimson Alchemist serving in jail?

256
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:30,150
Apparently, he was discharged.
Under orders from the Führer President.

257
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,110
I don't like the sound of that.

258
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,610
What's the matter?!

259
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,650
Intruders, ma'am! From underground!

260
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,320
What?!

261
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,710
Homunculus!

262
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,050
Dammit!

263
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:06,220
So they knew we came up here to search for ways to fight against the Homunculi?!

264
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,860
Don't fall asleep!!!

265
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,080
What?

266
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,160
Well, you know.

267
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,330
You heard about us from your Father at Central, right?

268
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,870
Y-Yeah.

269
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:35,090
We just came here to search for ways to get our bodies back...

270
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,260
Who... are you guys?

271
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,470
I... have to dig.

272
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,430
What a drag...

273
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,760
Such a drag...

274
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,520
Wait, could it be that he...

275
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:53,270
Yeah. Maybe neither Father nor the
Führer President have told him about us yet.

276
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:00,360
You bastard! So you are  spies from Drakma!

277
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,030
We're not!

278
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,870
Then why are you speaking to the intruder like you're friends?!

279
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,700
We're not friends!

280
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,740
You can't trick me!

281
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,870
This is in the way.

282
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,620
We're not lying!

283
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,410
We're just...

284
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,880
There's... so much room here.

285
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,300
Where am I?

286
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:29,720
Do I not have to dig anymore?

287
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,930
Fire!

288
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,110
Bullets are ineffective?!

289
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,780
Where... am I?

290
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,580
This is bad! He's headed for the development lair!

291
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,290
After him!

292
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,670
Contact the men up there!

293
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,920
We need to go after him, too!

294
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,750
Right!

295
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,610
He's huge...

296
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,240
It's... warm in here...

297
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:29,410
Stay where you are!

298
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,210
Put out the fire.

299
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,090
Roger!

300
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,470
I know I hit him...

301
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,600
It's no use, Boss!

302
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,850
Bullets don't work against him!

303
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:57,980
What did you say?!

304
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,860
All noncombatants are to withdraw immediately.

305
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,400
Shut off the alarm, too.

306
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,740
Don't let Drakma know about this commotion.

307
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,030
I've brought it, Boss!

308
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,990
Has it been tested?

309
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,160
There's no need for that.

310
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,750
It's the proud of work of us developers!

311
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,960
Remove the fuse from the shell!

312
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,080
Aye, ma'am!

313
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,220
First shell, loaded!

314
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,560
Fire!

315
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,060
Bull's eye!

316
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:46,070
Oww...

317
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:54,120
It's a drag to feel pain, too...

318
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,710
Don't just sit there!

319
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,460
Load the next shell!

320
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,750
Fire!

321
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,190
Oww...

322
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:23,190
Oh yeah, I forgot about my job.

323
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,110
I have to dig.

324
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,630
It's no use, General!

325
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,550
He won't die no matter what!

326
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,010
Won't die?!

327
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,300
What do you mean?!

328
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,510
Why do you know so much about that thing?!

329
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,520
I-I...

330
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,270
I don't like dilly-dalliers!

331
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:05,150
Answer everything that you can  answer!

332
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:08,070
How do you know about that thing?!

333
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,490
Are you a spy from Drakma?!

334
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:10,650
No!

335
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,780
Then is that thing a spy?!

336
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,450
I don't think so.

337
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,330
Does that thing know you?!

338
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,080
Probably not.

339
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,160
What is  that thing?!

340
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,790
I can't answer.

341
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,840
Who is commanding him to act?!

342
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,300
I can't answer!

343
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,800
And why can't you answer?

344
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,300
Please try to realize...

345
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,020
This is my last question.

346
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,560
Do you two plan to ally yourselves with us?

347
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,810
I don't want to see the people here die.

348
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,570
Tell me what his body is made of.

349
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,570
I'm fairly certain his body structure and composition are identical to humans.

350
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,120
Identical to humans, huh...

351
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,160
Buccaneer, bring me some tank fuel.

352
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,330
I'm going to pour it on him.

353
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,040
Roger!

354
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,670
I'm telling you, it's useless!

355
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,540
Even if you light him on fire, he won't...

356
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,800
I've already gathered from the
previous attacks that he won't die.

357
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,670
In that case, I'll just shut off his bodily functions.

358
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,550
I'll let him have something far worse than flames.

359
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,890
I'll show you how we do things at Briggs.

360
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:37,830
Even if we part and meet again, I want to meet at this place.

361
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:37,830
Megurimeguttemo mata koko de aitai

362
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:44,760
Then we'll hold hands to ensure we'll never be separated again.

363
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:44,760
Hagurenaiyouni kono te wo tsunagunda

364
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,390
We used to talk all night until the sun rose,

365
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,390
Asahi ga noboru made katariattane

366
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:50,220
And held hands till the sun went under the horizon.

367
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:50,220
Yuuhi ga shizumu made tsunaida te

368
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:55,470
Let's walk together like this forever, like light and shadow.

369
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:55,470
Kouyatte asu mo asatte mo tomo ni ayumou hikari to kage

370
00:22:55,560 --> 00:23:00,020
I stand in the city, staring off into space with lonely eyes.

371
00:22:55,560 --> 00:23:00,020
Samishige ni mitsumeru machi no naka de

372
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:05,360
I can't find warmth on my own.

373
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:05,360
Nukumori wa hitori ja mitsukaranakute

374
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,870
By meeting you, I realized

375
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,870
Ai ga konnani tsuyosa ni narukoto

376
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:16,700
How much strength love could give me.

377
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:16,700
Shittanda kimi ni deaete hajimete

378
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:21,960
Even if we part and meet again, I want to meet at this place.

379
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:21,960
Megurimeguttemo mata koko de aitai

380
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:27,260
Then we'll hold hands to ensure we'll never be separated again.

381
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:27,260
Hagurenaiyouni kono te wo tsunagunda

382
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:32,470
I can't sleep by myself, 'cause I can't dream without you.

383
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:32,470
Hitori ja nemurenai yume wa mirenaikara

384
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:38,230
So take me to a place where uncertainty can't reach us

385
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:38,230
Donna fuan mo todokanai tokoro e

386
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:43,480
And let us bring light to the night sky with no stars.

387
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:43,480
Hoshi no yoru mo terashitsuzukeyou

388
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,980
So long as you're with me, I can go to world's end.

389
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,980
Doko made mo yukeru kimi to nara

390
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,990
Even if it's a path I can't walk on my own,

391
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,990
Hitori ja arukenai michi mo futari nara

392
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:52,030
Hanauta utainagara arukerunda

393
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:52,030
If you're by my side, I can walk it while humming a tune.

394
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,450
If we're together, the world is mine.

395
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,450
Kimi ga ireba shiawase

396
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,400
The bodies that clash against each other..

397
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,230
The shells that explode in the air...

398
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,740
The battle against the Homunculus threatening the North defense.

399
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:11,080
Will it be us who will win the battle? Or perhaps...

400
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:15,870
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

401
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:19,870
The Shape of This Country

402
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:19,870
Episode 35, The Shape of This Country.

403
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,460
All that stands in our way shall be annihilated.

404
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:25,260
That is the law of the North.
