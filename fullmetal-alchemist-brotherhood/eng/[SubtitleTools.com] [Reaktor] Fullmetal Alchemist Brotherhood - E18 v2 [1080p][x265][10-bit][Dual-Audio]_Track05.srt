1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:06,190
Drawn by a landscape as white as snow,

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:06,190
Masshiro na keshiki ni ima sasowarete

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,740
I'm headed toward an unseen world.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,740
Boku wa yuku yo mada minu sekai e

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,680
I've been traveling while lost

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,680
Maigo no mama tabi shiteita

7
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,470
Under this gray sky.

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,460
Nezumiiro no sora no shita

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,560
Every day with new maps, stained with my many dreams.

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,560
Higawari no chizu ikutsumo no yume ga nijindeita

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,950
I wonder if someday,

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,950
Itsuka wa sa

13
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,990
Even with these tiny steps of mine,

14
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,990
Chippoke na boku no kono hohaba demo

15
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:43,070
I'll be able to travel beyond those clouds.

16
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:43,070
Ano kumo no mukou made yukeru kana

17
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,700
I put on a bold front.

18
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,700
Tsuyogatte

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,250
End up hurting myself.

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,250
Kizutsuita

21
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,330
I feel empty inside.

22
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,330
Kokoro sukashita youni

23
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,870
It's started to rain,

24
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,870
Furidashita

25
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,040
And the raindrops

26
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,040
Amatsubu tachi ga

27
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,260
Began to repeat their scattered reflections.

28
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,260
Ranhansha kurikaesu

29
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,130
These straight rays of light

30
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,130
Massugu na hikari ga

31
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,850
Start to cross one another.

32
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,850
Kousa shite

33
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,430
And without telling anyone where they're headed,

34
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,430
Yakusaki mo tsugenumama

35
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,720
Across the endless distances,

36
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,720
Doko made mo

37
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,310
They pass through all matter.

38
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,310
Tsukinukeru

39
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:14,140
I burn these faint afterimages onto my eyes.

40
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:14,140
Awai zanzou ryoume ni yakitsukete

41
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,060
Under this sky,

42
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,060
Kono sora no shita

43
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,890
Wherever I am,

44
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,890
Donna toko ni itemo

45
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,190
I should be able to reach

46
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,190
Todoku hazu nanda

47
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:27,000
The unseen world.

48
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:27,000
Mada minu sekai e

49
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,810
Resembool! We're in Resembool!

50
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,950
So what exactly are the Colonel's orders?

51
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,910
Can't you tell me already, Major?

52
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,410
I don't know many of the details, either.

53
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:52,910
I was simply told to bring you along to Resembool to meet up with the others.

54
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,750
Meet up with who?

55
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,880
Good day, Major Armstrong.

56
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,550
And...

57
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,130
Yo, Boss.

58
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,800
Second Lieutenant Breda?!

59
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,160
The Arrogant Palm
of a Small Human

60
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:15,140
Brother should have arrived in Resembool a while ago...

61
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,310
...but he still hasn't called...

62
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,650
And besides, I'm here if he needs to have his arm repaired.

63
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,860
There's so much we don't know,
including Second Lieutenant Ross' case...

64
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,820
Which is why I'm here to explain.

65
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,620
S-Since when?!

66
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,460
Where did you even come in from?!

67
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,420
The window.

68
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,170
I'm technically a criminal, after all.

69
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,170
SMUGGLED INTO THE COUNTRY

70
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:42,670
AND

71
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,170
BROKE OUT OF JAIL

72
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,430
Well, you guys don't need to worry about Edward.

73
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,970
Right now, he's probably...

74
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,930
So hot...

75
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,650
That damn Colonel... he didn't mention a word about us having to leave the country...

76
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,860
Mr. Han, are we almost there?

77
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,660
We've been here for a while now.

78
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,910
See? The Xerxes ruins.

79
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,510
Whew~

80
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,930
I almost burned myself with my automail...

81
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,510
Why is the brat with you?

82
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,180
For certain reasons.

83
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,940
Xerxes, huh...

84
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,560
I remember reading about it in
the tale about the Sage of the East.

85
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,320
Sage of the East?

86
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,360
Yeah.

87
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,490
A fairy tale about the alchemist who introduced alchemy to our country.

88
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:53,490
It's a legend about the sole survivor of the
Xerxes Kingdom, which was destroyed in one night,

89
00:03:53,490 --> 00:04:00,040
and how he arrived in Amestris, just recently founded
at that time, and spread alchemy throughout the country.

90
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,710
In our country, there's a legend stating he arrived from the west.

91
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:12,590
Eastern alchemy as we know it today is a combination of the skills he brought us and Xing's technology.

92
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,220
Oh, the one developed as a method of healing?

93
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,470
That's right.

94
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,100
We refer to him with respect,

95
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,230
as the "Sage of the West".

96
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,940
And this is where that sage was from?

97
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,780
That's what's been told.

98
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,320
Wow...

99
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,990
I wanted to see the Xerxes ruins.

100
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,500
Now I see why...

101
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:46,550
But I wonder if it's truly possible for them to be destroyed in one night despite having advanced technology like this.

102
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,050
It could just be a legend.

103
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,390
What are you doing?

104
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,390
This way.

105
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,830
We're going in pretty deep, aren't we...

106
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,250
Edward!

107
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,090
Eastern Headquarters, where I used to be stationed, was great.

108
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:38,310
It lacks the bustle of large cities,
and most of all, there are so many beauties.

109
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,020
That stupid colonel!

110
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,400
Second Lieutenant Ross!!!

111
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,280
Now, for the embrace of reunion!!!

112
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,400
I'll pass!

113
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,280
Second Lieutenant Ross!

114
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,240
There's no telling when we'd get caught if a dead person was walking around the country, so we had her flee.

115
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,790
So the Colonel knew all along
Second Lieutenant Ross was innocent?

116
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,130
Don't you think you're being a bit too flashy?

117
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,960
You think so, too?

118
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,800
Yes.

119
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,550
Hauling her down to the police station in front of a crowd...

120
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:20,180
Murdering a colleague is an embarrassment to the military, and yet, to have it make headlines...

121
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,560
It's me.

122
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,480
A call from Warrant Officer Falman on a general line, sir.

123
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,190
Put it through.

124
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,650
Colonel! About the murder of Brigadier General Hughes...

125
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,280
Hey Falman! Let me talk to him for a bit.

126
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,200
Barry?!

127
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,540
Yo, Mr. Mustang! Did you see the paper?

128
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,040
I've got something interesting to tell you.

129
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,710
Hey, Barney! You shouldn't use this line for private use!

130
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,420
I'll call you back from outside my office, so hang tight!

131
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,260
What? Is that true?

132
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,840
Yeah, the bullet the lieutenant used was the one she shot me with.

133
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,100
I still have the hole in my right hand.

134
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,730
I think we can set something up...

135
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,140
Huh?

136
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,100
Barry, don't you miss going on rampages?

137
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,900
Roger. I won't kill.

138
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,110
The second passage to the warehouse district, right?

139
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,330
Breda, go find these ingredients right away.

140
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,460
Pork bones and meat, carbon, ammonia.

141
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,050
What's all this for?

142
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,300
I'm going to whip up a burnt corpse.

143
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,010
H-Human transmutation?!

144
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,050
Don't be stupid.

145
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,890
It's going to be something that resembles a burnt corpse.

146
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,510
But if the medical examiner looks closely...

147
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,770
I'm going to burn it up so badly they won't even be able to have it appraised.

148
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,480
But what will you do if they decide to check the treatment marks on her teeth?

149
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,650
It's all under control.

150
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:55,780
Will you be able to do it?

151
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,120
I'm no expert, but I do know enough to make it happen.

152
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,200
I'm also good at transmuting burnt corpses.

153
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,710
Hurry!

154
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,630
You're Maria Ross, right?

155
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,100
It's a dummy.

156
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,640
You're going to die here tonight.

157
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,030
Don't just sit there.

158
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,500
Oww...

159
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,720
Yo, Fullmetal.

160
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,350
What's the meaning of this, Colonel?!

161
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,430
Huh? Was that the fullmetal boss?

162
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,190
That's not good... this was unexpected.

163
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:13,980
Edward...

164
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,860
Well, the Colonel will take care of it.

165
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,860
Let's go.

166
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,530
Roger.

167
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:28,910
While Barry was helping Ms. Ross break out of jail,
he made a deal with the Young Master.

168
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:34,620
And the Young Master commanded me to escort her to the east.

169
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:39,500
And we promised him we'd meet here to set Second Lieutenant Ross free.

170
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,260
I see.

171
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,380
I still don't like it...

172
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,800
It means the bastard colonel pulled a fast one on us, right?

173
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,140
It's more convincing to actually have you see her than to explain it in words, right?

174
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,480
I know, I know.

175
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,270
The Colonel is totally right this time.

176
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,650
Speaking of the Colonel...

177
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:06,660
I also recall him saying, "Having a pissed-off brat around the place would just be a total nuisance to the mission!"

178
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,240
That damned colonel!!!

179
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,080
What is this mission you speak of?

180
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,160
Is there something else to do aside from rescuing Second Lieutenant Ross?

181
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,420
Yes.

182
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,670
We decided to fish out the mastermind hiding within the military.

183
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,250
Next time I see him...

184
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,010
Fish out?

185
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:28,010
Barry, who knows the secret behind
Research Laboratory 5, went out and made a mess.

186
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,220
They'll definitely come to shut him up for good.

187
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,110
So that's how it was.

188
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:49,620
So the only reason they took Ed was because he'd be a nuisance?

189
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,370
I guess you could say that.

190
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:58,460
And I lent them a hand in exchange for Barry telling me the secret to his body.

191
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,130
But it turns out...

192
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,760
The scientist who turned me into this is long dead, so I don't really know.

193
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,930
What?! That's not fair!

194
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:13,470
Oh yeah, that Alphonse guy is kind of in the same boat as me, so why don't you try asking him?

195
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,440
So I decided to come to you instead.

196
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,560
It's a promise, so I'm counting on you!

197
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,030
Umm... I really don't have anything to do with that promise...

198
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,280
I really have nothing to do with this, do I...

199
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,410
Philosopher's stones... Homunculus...

200
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,700
I wonder why I was dragged into all this.

201
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,710
Now we have quite a bit of information.

202
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,000
If we discover the truth behind the murder of the Brigadier General, the situation will change, too.

203
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,510
We'll definitely prove you were falsely accused.

204
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:53,180
Lieute- Brigadier General Hughes...

205
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,520
He's really gone, isn't he...

206
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,520
What do you plan to do now?

207
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,150
Move forward on the path you're content with.

208
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:15,620
We have someone who's willing to collaborate with us, even though we committed taboo...

209
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,830
We also have someone who'll scold and support us...

210
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,000
I have a younger brother who I made a promise with... to return to our bodies...

211
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:30,130
I also don't have anywhere to return...

212
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:35,390
With that said, I have no choice but to move forward...

213
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,770
In a way that won't cause a single death of anyone important to me.

214
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,770
If it seems someone is going to be victimized, I'll protect them.

215
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,440
It may be difficult.

216
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:54,700
It's hard enough keeping my own head, but protecting others, too...

217
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,700
It may be arrogant of me,

218
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,160
but this is the only thing I can think of,

219
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,670
so I'm going to move forward.

220
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:17,970
Second Lieutenant Ross, what do you plan to do now?

221
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,980
I plan to go to the country of Xing.

222
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,730
Should I at least let your parents know?

223
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,490
No.

224
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:40,450
If it happens that information about me being alive is leaked from my parents, it'd be irreparable.

225
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,710
I see.

226
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,250
Major Armstrong. Second Lieutenant Breda.

227
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,130
Hm?

228
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,420
Please pass a message to Colonel Mustang for me.

229
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,470
"I greatly appreciate you saving me."

230
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,970
Ask him to order me back in the case of emergency.

231
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,640
I will gladly risk my life to assist him if that ever happens!

232
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,140
I will.

233
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:10,020
Stay well, Edward.

234
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,530
I never got you back for that slap.

235
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,530
Maybe next time.

236
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,920
Yeah. Maybe next time.

237
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,420
You have good friends.

238
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,550
Mr. Fu, what is Xing like?

239
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,180
It's a pleasant country, with great food and nice people.

240
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,930
There's no need to worry.

241
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,940
So I can expect a paradise after crossing this desert, right?

242
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,860
You sure can.

243
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:54,110
However, crossing this desert is a cruel task in itself.

244
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,700
Careful.

245
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,280
You should conserve your fluids.

246
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,790
I'll drop by your store tomorrow.

247
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:09,130
What do you want as your gift, Elizabeth?

248
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,840
Pardon me, Roy.

249
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,260
Kate, we have customers.

250
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,590
Could you go get Jacquelyn?

251
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,090
Jacquelyn, we have customers.

252
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,970
Roger.

253
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,070
Whoa!

254
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,940
Barry!

255
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,610
Calm down, Falman.

256
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,700
You can't kill this one!

257
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,750
This smell of cigarettes...

258
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,960
Second Lieutenant Havoc?!

259
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:02,050
Hey! What do you think I'm disguised for?!

260
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,970
This is why I can't stand guys who aren't used to battles!

261
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,600
I-I'm sorry, sir!

262
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,390
You were only "dragged in".

263
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,150
So don't attack him.

264
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:14,110
Someone from the army could be watching us at any moment.

265
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,780
You...

266
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,530
We're heading outside!

267
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,080
But there may be enemies outside!

268
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,750
We don't have to worry about that.

269
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,350
Shit!

270
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,260
Second Lieutenant!

271
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,820
Don't worry, we have the hawkeye on our side.

272
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,370
I just heard a loud noise. Is something wrong?

273
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,620
Nothing at all.

274
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:10,960
The customer played a prank on Jacquelyn, so I hit him a little.

275
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,290
Oh my.

276
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,790
You're harsh, Elizabeth.

277
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,800
All right, don't move.

278
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,550
We have a lot to ask you... er...

279
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,680
Does he understand what we're saying?

280
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,220
You've gotta be kidding me...

281
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,310
This is...

282
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,680
That's my body!!!

283
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,690
What?! How could this be?!

284
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:37,900
They threw in some kind of experimental animal or a soul inside my body!

285
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,690
And now, he's here to get his soul back!

286
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,860
This brings back so many memories!

287
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:49,040
I haven't seen it since I had my soul pulled out of me!

288
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,880
A transmutation circle.

289
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,170
It's similar to the one I saw in Research Laboratory 5.

290
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,680
A two-headed dragon... A sun...

291
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:07,640
Agh, dammit! The top part's gone, so I can't tell anything!

292
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,600
Need something from me?

293
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,360
If it's money, I don't-

294
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,270
An Ishbalan?

295
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:33,000
Young lad, would you become a hostage in order for us to get our holy land back from the army?

296
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,250
There's no way the army would give in for one kid like me.

297
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:41,710
The civil war began with the death of a child, as well.

298
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:46,090
We don't know what could be
the beginning of a change in history.

299
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,510
Cut it out; this is disgraceful.

300
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,220
Lady Shan!

301
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,770
You idiots...

302
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,270
Are you trying to bring shame to the Ishbalan name?

303
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,820
Could you let that man go?
He won't try to harm you anymore.

304
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,740
Why did you save me?

305
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,200
Don't you all hate Amestrians?

306
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:19,210
I know that not all Amestrians are evil.

307
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:28,010
Both Lady Shan and I were saved by Amestrian doctors when we were badly injured during the civil war.

308
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:35,350
In all honesty, we despise your kind, but I wouldn't be here today if it weren't for that couple.

309
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,560
Couple?

310
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,690
Could you be talking about the Rockbells?!

311
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,110
You know Doctor Rockbell?

312
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,610
Y-Yeah...

313
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,620
The doctor saved so many of us Ishbalans.

314
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:54,620
I see...

315
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,040
So Uncle and Aunt Rockbell...

316
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:05,210
They stayed with us, despite the war getting worse and worse.

317
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,130
How were their last moments?

318
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,640
They were killed by an Ishbalan...

319
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,140
...an Ishbalan patient they saved.

320
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,900
No way...

321
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,110
We're so sorry...

322
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,700
We couldn't stop him.

323
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,780
Who was it?!

324
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,290
I couldn't see his face.

325
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,540
But he was an Ishbalan with a tattoo on his right arm.

326
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:56,390
When you get the chance, please convey our feelings to their gravestones.

327
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,890
Both our gratitude... and our apologies...

328
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,120
This is just grand!

329
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:25,590
This is like the once-in-a-lifetime chance for me to cut up my own body as much as I want!

330
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,090
You told me earlier not to kill him!

331
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,590
To hell with this mission!

332
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,100
My soul keeps shaking... It wants to cut him up!

333
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,430
You can't do that.

334
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:41,770
Besides, wouldn't the normal approach to this be wishing to go back inside your old body?

335
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,100
That body won't last much longer.

336
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:48,360
Oh, so it's rotten...

337
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,740
I can't stand it anymore!!!

338
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,110
I'm going to cut him up!

339
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,860
I get to decide what to do with my own body!

340
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,450
I said, no!

341
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,580
What's wrong?

342
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,950
I wonder if it's a fight?

343
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,580
Seems like there's some trouble between her and the customer.

344
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,630
Oops, I'm going to have to call you back.

345
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,340
I've got a customer, too.

346
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:37,380
I don't have to act tough, right?

347
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:37,380
Tsuyogaranakute iindane

348
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:44,180
Dareka ga kaitetta

349
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:44,180
The scribbling someone made...

350
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:49,980
On the wall, of a flower is swaying.

351
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:49,980
Kabe no rakugaki no hana ga yureru

352
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,560
No one knows their true selves.

353
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,560
Jibunrashisa nante dermo wakaranaiyo

354
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,860
Even though we both lose and gain

355
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,860
Nagai nagai michi no tochuu de

356
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,280
By embarking on this long, long path,

357
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,280
Nakushitari hirottari

358
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:08,950
And though there may be days loneliness strikes and makes us weep...

359
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:08,950
Kyuu ni samishikunatte naichau hi mo arukedo

360
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:16,460
Namida mo itami mo hoshi ni kaeyou

361
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:16,460
Let's transform our tears and pains to stars.

362
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:22,460
Let's light a candle to illuminate our tomorrow.

363
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:22,460
Ashita wo terasu akari wo tomosou

364
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,590
And we'll hold our small hands over the fire to create stardust,

365
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,590
Chiisana te kazashite futari de tsukurou

366
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:32,810
And an eternity that shines so brilliantly.

367
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:32,810
Hoshikuzu wo tsuyoku hikaru eien wo

368
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:38,190
Farewells may be unavoidable,

369
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:38,190
Sayonara itsuka wa kurukamoshirenai

370
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:44,110
Yet the seasons continue to change obliviously.

371
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:44,110
Kisetsu wa soredemo meguri megutteku

372
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,200
Chiisaku mayottemo aruiteku

373
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,200
Even if I lose myself, I'll continue to walk...

374
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,240
Walk by your side.

375
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,240
Kimi to aruiteku

376
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,540
That's the only thing I'd like to never change.

377
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,540
Sore dake wa kawaranaideiyoune

378
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:02,650
She's a strong, proud woman.

379
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:06,320
A beautiful woman, loved by her comrades.

380
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:12,580
But her weapon which shoots down enemies has lost its power, and her flame of life fleetingly went out.

381
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:17,580
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

382
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:21,580
Death of the Undying

383
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:21,580
Episode 19, Death of the Undying.

384
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:25,880
She becomes anguished.
Her memories bring about her suffering.
