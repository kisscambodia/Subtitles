1
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,430
One human only has the power to do so much.

2
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,780
That's why I'm going to protect...

3
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,370
...even if it's just a handful of them...

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,250
...the ones most important to me.

5
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,630
A subordinate protects their subordinate, and so forth.

6
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,300
That should be possible, even for us puny humans.

7
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,630
Geometric progression?

8
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,510
Which means this.

9
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,810
If you want to protect this whole country,

10
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,480
you have to be at the top of the summit.

11
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,310
It must feel great up there, Hughes.

12
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,490
But I can't climb to the top with my own strength.

13
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,240
I'm sure of it.

14
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,620
What are you getting all worked up for?

15
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,120
Sounds interesting.

16
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,080
I'm in.

17
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,670
I want to see what kind of changes
your naive ideals will bring to this country.

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,630
Colonel...

19
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,390
Colonel.

20
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,810
Why not head to the nap room if you're tired?

21
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,180
Yeah... sorry.

22
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:39,570
I wanted to finish up the documents I've started before I get transferred to Central.

23
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,360
I haven't slept much lately.

24
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,570
It seemed you were dreaming about something.

25
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,660
What? Just a boring flashback.

26
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,020
Seperate Destinations

27
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,920
I've still got a lot of years ahead of me

28
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,920
Kono omoi wo keshiteshimau niwa

29
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,840
To just erase these feelings?

30
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,920
Mada jinsei nagai desho?

31
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:57,880
To just erase these feelings?

32
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:57,920
To just erase these feelings?

33
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,930
I want to go back and finish

34
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,930
Yarinokoshiteru koto

35
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,560
The things that I've yet to finish.

36
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,560
Yarinaoshite mitai kara

37
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:20,820
I was supposed to be chasing after my ongoing dream,

38
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:20,820
Yume no tsuzuki oikaketeita hazu nanoni

39
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:27,160
Magarikunetta hosoi michi hito ni tsumazuku

40
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:27,160
Yet I faltered over others while walking this thin, winding path.

41
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,330
It's not that I want to return to those days.

42
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,330
Ano koro mitainitte modoritai wake ja nai no

43
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,840
I'm searching for the sky I lost.

44
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,840
Nakushitekita sora wo sagashiteru

45
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,500
Don't make that sad face, as if you've fallen victim.

46
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,500
Wakatte kuremasu youni

47
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,720
As if you want people to pity you.

48
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,720
Gisei ni natta youna kanashii kao wa yameteyo

49
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,430
Tears aren't the end of your sins.

50
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,430
Tsumi no saigo wa namida ja nai yo

51
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,100
You have to bear them painfully, forever.

52
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,100
Zutto kurushiku seottekunda

53
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,760
Who are you waiting for in the maze of emotions,

54
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,760
Deguchi mienai kanjoumeiro ni

55
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,430
Where you can't even see the exit?

56
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,430
Dare wo matteruno?

57
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,230
I want to blurt it out more justly,

58
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,230
Shiroi nooto ni tsuzutta youni

59
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,980
Just like how I wrote it in my white notebook.

60
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,980
Motto sunao ni hakidashitai yo

61
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,650
What do you want to run from?

62
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,650
Nani kara nogaretainda

63
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,270
That thing called "reality"?

64
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,270
Genjitsu tte yatsu?

65
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,610
Kanaeru tame ni ikiterundatte

66
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,610
I just want to scream out,

67
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,030
"I'm only living to fulfill my wish." Can you hear me?

68
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,030
Sakebitaku naru yo kikoeteimasuka?

69
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:05,160
I can't take the safe way out of everything.

70
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:05,160
Bunan ni nante yatterarenaikara

71
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,950
I don't even have a place to return to.

72
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,950
Kaeru basho mo nai no

73
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,250
I'm always thankful for everyone's kindness,

74
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,250
Yasashisa ni wa itsumo kansha shiteru

75
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,630
That's why I want to become stronger. (I'm on the way)

76
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,630
Dakara tsuyoku naritai (I'm on the way)

77
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,590
This is reminding me of the old days.

78
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,590
Natsukashiku naru

79
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,840
Konna itami mo kangei jan

80
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,840
This pain is all right with me.

81
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,880
I don't remember anything after being kicked by this guy.

82
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:31,640
"Guardians with only souls",
"precious sacrifices", "being kept alive".

83
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,220
"Tattoo of Ouroboros", and
"transmutation circle for a philosopher's stone".

84
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,140
According to Dr. Marcoh,
the stones were used in Ishbal, as well...

85
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,310
There are too many mysteries for it to be an ordinary experiment.

86
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:49,360
I'd like to look into it some more,
but the research lab is in ruins now.

87
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,360
Hmm...

88
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,990
Seems like they're discussing something tricky...

89
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:00,410
I don't feel like getting involved in something dangerous again, so I refuse to listen!

90
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,170
Hey, you two...

91
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,090
Is this the Fullmetal Alchemist's recovery room?

92
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,630
Yes, he's in here...

93
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:15,180
We may be able to discover something if we look through the court-martial chamber.

94
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:22,140
I'll go and investigate the ones who were participating in the research of the stones under Dr. Marcoh.

95
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,190
Sorry to intrude.

96
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,280
F-Führer-President... King Bradley!

97
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,330
Quiet down. You can be at ease.

98
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,450
Your Excellency, may I ask why you are here?

99
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,120
Why I'm here?

100
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,870
To visit this boy, of course.

101
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,540
Are you fond of melon at all?

102
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,000
Oh... thank you.

103
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,840
Wait, something's wrong here!

104
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,550
Seems like you've been doing a lot of investigating of the military leadership, Major Armstrong.

105
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,600
Huh?! Well... that's...

106
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,140
How did you...

107
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,350
Don't underestimate my intelligence network.

108
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,600
And you, Edward Elric...

109
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,440
The philosopher's stone, right?

110
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,320
Just how much did you find out?
Depending on that, I may have to...

111
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,460
I'm joking!

112
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,880
No need to get tense.

113
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,040
What?

114
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:34,340
I, too, was aware there have been
disquieting activities within the military.

115
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,300
I've always wanted to do something about them, but...

116
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,220
Oh, that's...

117
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,680
A list of people who were researching the philosopher's stones, eh?

118
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,980
Every one of them has been reported missing.

119
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,560
What?!

120
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,820
They have been reported missing a few days prior to the destruction of Research Laboratory 5.

121
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,740
The enemy is always ahead of us.

122
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,530
Even with my intelligence network,
we still don't know the scale of it all,

123
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:04,330
their objectives, or how close they are to achieving them.

124
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,000
So you're saying it's extremely dangerous for us to look into it.

125
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,130
That's right.

126
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,960
Lt. Colonel Hughes,

127
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,880
Major Armstrong,

128
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,550
Elric Brothers,

129
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,970
I've decided you all are trustworthy people.

130
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:24,730
I forbid you to continue investigating this matter or to disclose it to others!

131
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:30,980
You cannot trust anyone in a situation like this,
when you cannot even distinguish friend from foe!

132
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,990
Regard all of the military as your foe and proceed carefully!

133
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,490
However...

134
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,410
When the time comes, I will have many tasks for all of you.

135
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,580
So be prepared.

136
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,660
Yes, sir!

137
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,460
Your Excellency!

138
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,620
Where have you gone, Your Excellency?!

139
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,210
Ah, drats! Here comes my annoying subordinate.

140
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,220
I snuck out of my office, after all.

141
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,180
Farewell!

142
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,930
Hey, Ed.

143
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:06,520
Huh?

144
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,850
What are you guys doing?

145
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,440
Let's just say... a storm just went by.

146
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,570
I went out and bought the tickets you asked for.

147
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,700
Tomorrow's afternoon train, right?

148
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,030
Yeah, thanks.

149
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:27,500
Why are you in such a rush?
Your wounds haven't even healed yet.

150
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,080
I can't stay in a place reeking of antiseptics like this forever.

151
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,460
Where are you going this time?

152
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,090
Dublith?

153
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,300
Yeah.

154
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,050
After discussing it with Al, we decided to stop by our master's place.

155
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,850
I'm scared, Brother...

156
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,930
We're probably going to get killed!

157
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,810
C-Courage, my little brother!

158
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,560
I'm just as scared as you are!

159
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,110
What kind of person is your master...

160
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,240
Dublith is quite far from here.

161
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,530
Where is it?

162
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:03,280
Let's see... It's here. It's right in the middle of the South.

163
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,910
W-What?!

164
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,790
This place! Before Dublith!

165
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,000
The Holy Land of Automails, Rush Valley!

166
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,800
I've always wanted to go there!

167
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,420
Please take me! Please take me!

168
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,220
Take me! You better take me!

169
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,050
Why don't you go by yourself?

170
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,300
Who's going to pay for the trip, then?

171
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,010
You're planning on making me  pay for it?!

172
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,560
Sure, why not? It's on the way, after all.

173
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,640
I guess it's okay...

174
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,190
Hooray!

175
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,940
I'm going to give Granny a call!

176
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,320
Yeah, she'll make a grand wife.

177
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,820
Don't tell me  that!

178
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,200
Not as grand as my wife, though!

179
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,120
Well, Papa's going to be on his way!

180
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,250
Are you going to come home early today, Papa?

181
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,710
Hmm, I wonder?

182
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,750
Papa's got a lot of work to do!

183
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,760
But I'll come home as soon as I can!

184
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,640
You're going to be late.

185
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,810
You're going to be leaving today, right, Winry?

186
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,980
I can't see you off because of work, so...

187
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,440
Take care of yourself.

188
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,860
I'm truly indebted to you, Mr. Hughes.

189
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,150
Be sure to drop by if you ever come to Central again.

190
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,570
Think of it as your home.

191
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,330
And give my regards to those boys, too.

192
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:28,990
Okay!

193
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,450
Good luck at work, Papa!

194
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,870
See you!

195
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,550
Why did you decide to go visit your master all of a sudden?

196
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,140
Two reasons.

197
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,810
First off, we've kind of been on a losing streak.

198
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:52,720
What?!

199
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,770
You're going because you want to get stronger?!

200
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,140
What are you guys, muscleheads?

201
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:59,980
Idiot! It's not that simple!

202
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,690
We don't just want to get stronger physically, but should we say mentally, too...

203
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:04,280
Right?

204
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,950
Yeah.

205
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:10,030
Anyway, we feel like we'll be able to get stronger if we visit our master.

206
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,040
I want to become far stronger than I am now.

207
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,670
And your second reason?

208
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,800
I want to ask about philosopher's stones.

209
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,130
The real truth that is beyond truth...

210
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:27,880
We never found out the meaning of those words, after all.

211
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,680
Our master might know something about it.

212
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,890
We can't be caring about how we're going to look out there.

213
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:37,480
We're going to ask our master while being prepared to be killed...

214
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,560
Ask...

215
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,610
Ask...

216
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,280
It was a short-lived life.

217
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,660
I wish I could have had a girlfriend, at least...

218
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,820
What kind of person is your master?

219
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,950
A riot in Lior?

220
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:54,870
Yes.

221
00:10:55,290 --> 00:11:01,540
Apparently, the riot caused by some Leto cult
deceiving the citizens has finally calmed down.

222
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,840
I see...

223
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,970
With Ishbal and other riots...
the East sure have their hands full.

224
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:12,430
Not just the East, but there are riots and border wars
sparking up in the North and the West.

225
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,890
Mountains of corpses everywhere, huh...

226
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,100
We may even get a coup soon...

227
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,570
Where are you headed, Lt. Colonel?

228
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,280
To the library.

229
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,370
Riots throughout Lior.

230
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,080
The ingredients of philosopher's stones are humans...

231
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,590
What we did in Ishbal...

232
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:49,970
Whoa now, who's the mastermind behind all of this?

233
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,260
I've got to hurry and let the Führer-President know...

234
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,430
Nice to meet you, Lt. Colonel Hughes.

235
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:02,600
Or should I say... farewell?

236
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,580
Cool tattoo you've got there.

237
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,000
You found out too much, Lt. Colonel Hughes.

238
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,770
Dammit...

239
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,730
That's something I  should be saying.

240
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,820
Oh, Lt. Colonel Hughes.

241
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,200
If you're here to call someone about your family again-

242
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,950
Lt. Colonel, you're bleeding!

243
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:02,040
It's nothing. I need to use the phone...

244
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,130
I need to call the Führer-President building...

245
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,180
Sorry to bother you...

246
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,590
Lt. Colonel!

247
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,430
Hello? You've reached Eastern Headquarters.

248
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,350
Let me talk to Roy... Colonel Roy Mustang.

249
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,440
We're not permitted to relay direct calls from an outside line.

250
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,520
I'm Lt. Colonel Hughes from Central!

251
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,400
I'm calling from a phone booth because of an emergency!

252
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,650
Please give me the code.

253
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,690
What a bother!

254
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:38,830
Uncle-Sugar-Oliver-Eight-Zero-Zero!

255
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,330
I've verified the code.

256
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,790
One moment, please.

257
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,040
Hurry up!

258
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,290
The military is in danger!

259
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,760
Could you put down the receiver, Lt. Colonel?

260
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,510
The receiver, please.

261
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,850
2nd Lt. Ross... or not.

262
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:02,890
Who are you?

263
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,770
I'm 2nd Lt. Maria Ross. Have you forgotten?

264
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:07,900
No, you're not.

265
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,900
2nd Lt. Ross has a mole under her left eye!

266
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,150
Huh? Really?

267
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,030
I was careless.

268
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,040
How's this?

269
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,290
What the hell...

270
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,290
It's as if I'm dreaming.

271
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:32,670
Your quick-wittedness brought the end of you, Lt. Colonel Hughes.

272
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,050
Hey now, give me a break.

273
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,090
I've got a wife and a daughter waiting for me at home.

274
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,930
There's no way...

275
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,060
...I can die here!

276
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,890
Perfect staging, right?

277
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,600
Damn you!!!

278
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,120
Lt. Colonel Hughes from Central is on a public line.

279
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,410
Again?

280
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,790
Put him through.

281
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,990
It's me.

282
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,330
If it's about your daughter again, I'm hanging up.

283
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:10,710
Hughes?

284
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,210
Hughes...

285
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,550
Hey, Hughes!

286
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,890
Humans are so foolish.

287
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,310
Risking their lives for something so stupid.

288
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,280
Elicia... Gracia...

289
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,110
I'm sorry...

290
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:45,830
I don't think I can... keep my promise...

291
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,710
Wow, this is delicious!

292
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,590
These apple pies are awesome!

293
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,970
Miss Gracia is such a good cook!

294
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,390
I know that.

295
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,470
The quiche she made for us once was really good.

296
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,890
It's on my "list of things to eat when I get my body back".

297
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:15,270
She taught me how to make it, so I'll bake one for you when you get your body back, Al.

298
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,860
Yay!

299
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,740
Mr. Hughes and Miss Gracia are both wonderful people.

300
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:27,740
Lt. Colonel Hughes is such a doting father...
and kind of annoying because he's so meddlesome.

301
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,250
He always came to poke fun at you in your hospital room, didn't he?

302
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,920
Seriously.

303
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:40,130
He's always saying he's busy with work, yet he paid me a visit every day.

304
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,930
We have to thank him next time.

305
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,010
Yeah.

306
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:20,300
Mama... why are they burying Papa?

307
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,800
Elicia...

308
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,890
Papa won't be able to go to work if they do that.

309
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,430
Elici...

310
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,730
Papa said he had a lot of work to do!

311
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:35,980
Stop!

312
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,190
Don't bury him!

313
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,320
Papa!!!

314
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,160
Specially promoted two ranks after being killed in the line of duty.

315
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,320
Brigadier General Hughes... huh?

316
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,040
You said you were going to work under me and support me.

317
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,960
What's the point if you surpass my rank?

318
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,580
Idiot...

319
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:58,840
Colonel.

320
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:07,220
Alchemists are unpleasant creatures, aren't they, Lieutenant?

321
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:14,480
I'm desperately putting together the theory of human transmutation in my head.

322
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:21,110
I feel like I know how those boys felt when they tried to transmute their mother.

323
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,610
Are you all right?

324
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:28,490
Yeah.

325
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,490
Ah, it looks like it's beginning to rain.

326
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:36,330
No, I don't think so...

327
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,250
No, it's raining all right.

328
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,420
You're right.

329
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,220
Let's go back.

330
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,510
We'll catch colds.

331
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,560
He left the room saying that
he was going to go to the library.

332
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:58,060
That was the last I saw of the Lt. Colonel.

333
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,400
Did he fight with someone in here?

334
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,690
Most likely.

335
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:07,820
There were bloodstains from the room to the hallway.

336
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,740
And his next destination was...

337
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,870
Lt. Colonel tried to make a phone call,
even while he was injured...

338
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:20,370
But... he left without doing so.

339
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,920
He realized something in the court-martial chamber...

340
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:31,640
...and took the trouble to contact me from the outside when he could have called from within the building.

341
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:37,640
The telephone operator in the Eastern Headquarters heard Hughes say, "The military is in danger".

342
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:39,770
What is it?

343
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,480
What was he trying to tell me?

344
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:49,450
Colonel, I've brought Major Armstrong.

345
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:57,330
We have an idea of the ones who murdered Lt. Colonel Hughes.

346
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,290
Then why don't you take them into custody?!

347
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:03,670
We have an idea, but we don't know exactly who they are.

348
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,670
What do you mean? Tell me in detail.

349
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,670
I cannot.

350
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,010
I, a Colonel, am telling you to speak.

351
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,550
Are you going to disobey a senior officer?!

352
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,560
I cannot speak.

353
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,190
Understood.

354
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,020
Sorry for calling you out here.

355
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,150
You may go.

356
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,020
Yes, sir.

357
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,820
Sir, I forgot to mention.

358
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,700
The Elric Brothers had been staying here until a few days ago.

359
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,960
The Elric Brothers?

360
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,330
Yes, the Elric Brothers.

361
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,710
Did they find what they were looking for?

362
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,920
No.

363
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,220
What they are looking for is almost legendary.

364
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,090
I see. Thanks.

365
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:00,810
We couldn't get much out of him, could we?

366
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,600
Seriously...

367
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,310
The Major is truly good-natured.

368
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,190
He said specifically,
"ones who murdered Lt. Colonel Hughes".

369
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:11,070
Which means there were several.

370
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:14,110
It could be that they're working as an organization.

371
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,330
If he can't speak, even under order from a colonel,

372
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:24,500
that means someone higher ranked than me is imposing silence on him.

373
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,500
We can assume the top of the military is behind it.

374
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,510
And the thing the Elric Brothers are looking for...

375
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,380
In other words, the philosopher's stone.

376
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:41,560
An organization that has a hand in the military leadership, the philosopher's stone, and Lt. Colonel Hughes...

377
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,430
Just how does it all relate...

378
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,020
As for now, we don't know.

379
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:53,150
But once I get transferred to Central, I'll investigate the leadership and find out who killed Hughes.

380
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,740
It's unlike you to mix up private and public matters.

381
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,780
There are no "private" or "public" matters involved.

382
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:03,120
Aiming to become Führer-President and avenging Hughes' death...

383
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,540
...are both my will as an individual.

384
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,040
Our target will be the military leadership. You're coming with me, right?

385
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,300
Like I'll back down now.

386
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:33,090
Say, the sky we saw that day, the scarlet sky.

387
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:33,090
Ano hi mita sora akaneiro no sora wo

388
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:38,300
Do you remember it from that day?

389
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:38,300
Nee kimi wa oboeteimasuka

390
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:44,230
We made a promise and a vow while the early summer wind circled us.

391
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:44,230
Yakusoku chigiri shoka no kaze ga tsutsumu

392
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,480
And we clung close together.

393
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,480
Futari yorisotta

394
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:57,530
Muri na egao no ura

395
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:57,530
Your forced smile

396
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:02,910
Holds elongated shadows.

397
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:02,910
Nobita kage wo kakumau

398
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:12,170
I pretend not to notice and continue on.

399
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:12,170
Dakara kizukanu furi saisei wo erabu

400
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:21,680
All the while waiting for you to deliver some news at the table.

401
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:21,680
Teeburu no ue no furuenai shirase machitsuzukete

402
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:30,060
Empty nights, mornings that will never arrive,

403
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:30,060
Kuuhaku no yoru mo kuru hazu no nai asa mo

404
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:34,820
I could see them from a mile away.

405
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:34,820
Zenbu wakattetanda

406
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:40,450
Say, the sky we saw that day, the scarlet sky.

407
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:40,450
Ano hi mita sora akaneiro no sora wo

408
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:45,370
I'm sure you'll remember it one day.

409
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:45,370
Nee itsuka omoidasu deshou

410
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:51,210
While holding the promise we couldn't keep,

411
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:51,210
Hatasenakatta yakusoku wo idaite

412
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:55,460
We take our first steps down our own paths.

413
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:55,460
Futari arukidasu

414
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:05,510
Ed and Al run through Rush Valley, chasing after Paninya, a girl who stole Ed's silver pocket watch,

415
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,850
although they have no idea what's awaiting them.

416
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:16,560
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

417
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:20,570
Episode 11, Miracle at Rush Valley.

418
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,580
Miracle at Rush Valley

419
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,490
The words the boy engraved were words of resolve.

420
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,740
Or could they be...
