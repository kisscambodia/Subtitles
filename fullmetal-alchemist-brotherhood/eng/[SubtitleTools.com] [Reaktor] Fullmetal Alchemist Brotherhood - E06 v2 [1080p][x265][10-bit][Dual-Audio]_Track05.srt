1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:05,850
Alchemy is a science where one understands the structure of matter, breaks it down, then rebuilds it.

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:11,480
However, it is not an all-powerful technique,
as one cannot create something out of nothing.

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:17,610
If one wishes to gain something,
one must present something of equal value.

4
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:22,030
This is the concept of equivalent exchange, the fundamental basis of alchemy.

5
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,700
However, there is a taboo in alchemy. Human transmutation.

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,540
One must not commit this act.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,970
I've still got a lot of years ahead of me

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,970
Kono omoi wo keshiteshimau niwa

9
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,880
To just erase these feelings?

10
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,970
Mada jinsei nagai desho?

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:35,930
To just erase these feelings?

12
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:35,970
To just erase these feelings?

13
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,970
I want to go back and finish

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,970
Yarinokoshiteru koto

15
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,600
The things that I've yet to finish.

16
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,600
Yarinaoshite mitai kara

17
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:58,870
I was supposed to be chasing after my ongoing dream,

18
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:58,870
Yume no tsuzuki oikaketeita hazu nanoni

19
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:05,210
Yet I faltered over others while walking this thin, winding path.

20
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:05,210
Magarikunetta hosoi michi hito ni tsumazuku

21
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,380
It's not that I want to return to those days.

22
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,380
Ano koro mitainitte modoritai wake ja nai no

23
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,880
I'm searching for the sky I lost.

24
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,880
Nakushitekita sora wo sagashiteru

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,550
Don't make that sad face, as if you've fallen victim.

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,550
Wakatte kuremasu youni

27
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:18,760
As if you want people to pity you.

28
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:18,760
Gisei ni natta youna kanashii kao wa yameteyo

29
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,470
Tears aren't the end of your sins.

30
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,470
Tsumi no saigo wa namida ja nai yo

31
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,140
You have to bear them painfully, forever.

32
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,140
Zutto kurushiku seottekunda

33
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,810
Who are you waiting for in the maze of emotions,

34
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,810
Deguchi mienai kanjoumeiro ni

35
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,480
Where you can't even see the exit?

36
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,480
Dare wo matteruno?

37
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,270
I want to blurt it out more justly,

38
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,270
Shiroi nooto ni tsuzutta youni

39
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,020
Just like how I wrote it in my white notebook.

40
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,020
Motto sunao ni hakidashitai yo

41
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,690
What do you want to run from?

42
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,690
Nani kara nogaretainda

43
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,320
That thing called "reality"?

44
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,320
Genjitsu tte yatsu?

45
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,650
I just want to scream out,

46
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,650
Kanaeru tame ni ikiterundatte

47
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,070
"I'm only living to fulfill my wish." Can you hear me?

48
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,070
Sakebitaku naru yo kikoeteimasuka?

49
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:43,200
Bunan ni nante yatterarenaikara

50
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:43,200
I can't take the safe way out of everything.

51
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't even have a place to return to.

52
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,000
Kaeru basho mo nai no

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,290
I'm always thankful for everyone's kindness,

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,290
Yasashisa ni wa itsumo kansha shiteru

55
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,670
That's why I want to become stronger. (I'm on the way)

56
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,670
Dakara tsuyoku naritai (I'm on the way)

57
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,630
This is reminding me of the old days.

58
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,630
Natsukashiku naru

59
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,880
This pain is all right with me.

60
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,880
Konna itami mo kangei jan

61
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,510
Scar, a man who only targets State Alchemists,

62
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,760
attacked Edward Elric.

63
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:12,560
Although Ed accepted death at Scar's hand,

64
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,770
his life was saved thanks to interference by Colonel Mustang and his men.

65
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,900
Ed and Al, who discovered the joy of being alive,

66
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:28,610
decided to return to their birthplace, Resembool, to restore their bodies.

67
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,110
Road of Hope

68
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,710
Yo.

69
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,460
Lt. Colonel Hughes.

70
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,460
The guys at Eastern Headquarters said that they were too busy to come.

71
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,130
So I'm here to see you off instead.

72
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,970
That's fine with me, but...

73
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,180
...why is the Major...

74
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,600
It's only natural you'd get an escort.

75
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Getting attacked by Scar in your state wouldn't be too pretty, would it?

76
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:01,270
Just accept the Major's kindness.

77
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,730
Children don't need to be reserved.

78
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,150
Don't treat me like a kid!

79
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,860
And Al is going to be on this ride, too, right?

80
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,660
Of course.

81
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,410
I thought he'd be lonely riding alone.

82
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,620
What the hell do you take my brother for?!

83
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,460
Oh, it's time.

84
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,670
Well guys, take care.

85
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,380
If you ever happen to stop by Central again, come say hi.

86
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,420
Dr. Marcoh!

87
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,920
You're Dr. Marcoh, aren't you?!

88
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,890
It's me, Alex Louis Armstrong from Central!

89
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,930
Someone you know?

90
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,850
He's a talented alchemist who used to reside in Central.

91
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,400
He was studying how to apply alchemy to medical treatment,

92
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,030
but he had been reported missing after the civil war in Ishbal.

93
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,570
Let's get off here, Major.

94
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,570
I have a feeling he'd know something about the transmutation of living organisms.

95
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,500
Do you know someone who looks like this?

96
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,710
Wow, you're good at drawing.

97
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,880
Drawing portraits is a skill that has been passed down in the Armstrong household for generations.

98
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,300
This is Dr. Mauro, isn't it?

99
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:52,880
"Mauro"?

100
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,300
We were in a tight spot because our doctors were drafted for the civil war.

101
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,640
I don't know what would have happened if Dr. Mauro hadn't come.

102
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,150
He doesn't abandon a single patient
no matter who it is. We owe him so much.

103
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,650
It's like something flashes before your eyes,
and suddenly, your wounds are already healed.

104
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,740
This must be the place.

105
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,070
Hello?

106
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,330
Whoa!

107
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,330
Why did you come here?

108
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,250
Are you here to take me back?!

109
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,580
Please calm down, Doctor.

110
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,790
I don't want to go back there anymore.

111
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,830
Please, let me go!

112
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,210
No, you've got it all wrong! We just...

113
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,300
Then did you come here to seal my mouth?!

114
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,630
No, we...

115
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,300
You can't trick me!

116
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,640
I'm asking you to please calm down!

117
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,810
Al!!!

118
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,810
I had no idea you were hiding out in the countryside under an assumed name.

119
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,440
I heard a rumor you took some classified documents with you when you disappeared.

120
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,070
I couldn't stand it any longer.

121
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,740
Sure, it was an order from the superiors...

122
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,950
...but because of it, I had to stain my hands by conducting research on such a thing...

123
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,450
"Such a thing"?

124
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:11,210
So many innocent people died because of it in the civil war in Ishbal...

125
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:17,720
I can't atone for what I've done, even with my life.

126
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:23,350
So I decided to become a doctor for this town because I wanted to do all I could to pay for my sins.

127
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:30,110
Doctor, what exactly were you ordered to research?

128
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,860
The Philosopher's Stone.

129
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:41,280
The things I took with me are
the research data and the stone itself.

130
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,870
You have the stone?! Here?!

131
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,170
Isn't that a liquid, not a stone?

132
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,760
"The Philosopher's Stone"...

133
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,260
"The Heavenly Stone"...

134
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,100
"The Great Elixir"... "The Red Tincture"...

135
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,560
"The Fifth Element".

136
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:17,320
They aren't necessarily in the shape of a stone,
just as how the stone itself has many different names.

137
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,240
But this is incomplete.

138
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,160
I don't know when it'll reach its limit and become unusable.

139
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:29,210
But it definitely displayed its power during the Ishbalan war.

140
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,080
Same with the bogus High Priest of Lior.

141
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:37,460
His abilities were improved,
even though the stone was incomplete.

142
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:44,600
If something like that can be made,
it's possible to perfect it if we give it more research!

143
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,430
Dr. Marcoh, please show me the research data!

144
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,110
Major... who is this boy?

145
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,020
He's a State Alchemist.

146
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,900
A boy like this...

147
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,370
There were so many alchemists who gave up their state qualifications after the civil war...

148
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:10,210
...because they couldn't stand being human weapons...

149
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,040
And yet, you...

150
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,500
I know it's stupid!

151
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:21,840
But I'm willing to go through hell until I achieve my goal!

152
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,020
I see... so you broke the taboo...

153
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,600
I'm amazed.

154
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,440
You were able to affix the soul of a human being.

155
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,610
You just might be able to create a perfect Philosopher's Stone.

156
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,820
Then...

157
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,530
I can't show you the data.

158
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,530
But!

159
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,040
You mustn't desire such a thing.

160
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,080
Even if it's to get our bodies back?!

161
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,040
You mustn't!

162
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,460
That is the Devil's research.

163
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,590
You'll see Hell if you study it.

164
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,670
I've seen Hell already!

165
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,300
Sorry. Please, leave...

166
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,610
I've seen Hell already!

167
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,530
Is it really okay?

168
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:35,210
It's incomplete, but we could have taken at least the stone by force.

169
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:40,050
Of course I wanted it. I wanted it so badly, but...

170
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:46,260
We don't want to steal the only support the people in this town have in order to get our bodies back.

171
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:51,260
It's good enough that we found out
a Philosopher's Stone can be created.

172
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,810
We'll look for another way.

173
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,980
But what about you, though?

174
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,780
Don't you have to report Dr. Marcoh to Central?

175
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,070
The person I met today is
a town doctor by the name of Mauro.

176
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:09,990
Hey!

177
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,580
Dr. Marcoh.

178
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,830
This is where the data is hidden.

179
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,590
If you still feel you won't regret
discovering the truth, take a look.

180
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,840
You may be able to reach
the real truth that is beyond truth...

181
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:33,140
No... this is unnecessary.

182
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,020
I pray you boys will be able to get your bodies back.

183
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,530
What does it say, Brother?

184
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,660
National Central Library, 1st Branch.

185
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,410
Makes sense. A forest would be
an ideal place to hide a tree, after all.

186
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,040
There are enough books in there to last several lifetimes.

187
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,380
I can find a clue to getting the stone here.

188
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,930
There you are, Marcoh.

189
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,280
Winry! Winry!

190
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,780
You've got an old customer at the door!

191
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,410
Yo, Granny.

192
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,450
We're back!

193
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,460
God, what happened to you two?

194
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,750
A lot. We're going to need your help again.

195
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,880
This is Major Armstrong.

196
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,590
Pleasure to meet you, I'm Pinako Rockbell.

197
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,470
But gosh darn, looks like Ed got shorter after not seeing him for some time.

198
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,350
Hey, I'm pretty sure you're supposed to say "got taller" at times like this...

199
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,100
If you really did, then I'd say so.

200
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,980
What did you say, you minimum hag?!

201
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:11,990
Didn't I tell you to give me a call
before stopping by for maintenance?!

202
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,030
You trying to kill me, Winry?!

203
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,750
Welcome back!

204
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:19,910
Yeah.

205
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,420
My bad, my bad. It broke.

206
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,550
"Broke"?

207
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:31,510
An automail of the highest quality... That I worked so hard on...

208
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,010
Yeah, to smithereens.

209
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,470
And Al is broken, too?

210
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,640
What the heck have you guys been doing?

211
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,230
All you ever do is worry me!

212
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,900
I see.

213
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:56,700
So you want to return to Central as soon as possible to get that data, eh?

214
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,330
Yeah. So I want you to fix me up as quick as you can.

215
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,040
Looks like I'll need to adjust your leg,
too, and not just your arm.

216
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,960
Oh my, seems like you've at least grown a bit.

217
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,590
Shut up!

218
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:12,090
Unlike your leg though, I'm going to have to remake your arm from scratch.

219
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,680
Will it take a week?

220
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,340
Don't underestimate me.

221
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,600
Three days.

222
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,770
You'll have to bear with a spare for now.

223
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:24,640
Okay.

224
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,110
It's tough to walk when you're not used to the leg.

225
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,230
I'll fix it up before you get used to it.

226
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,690
But seriously...

227
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,740
Materials... Assembly... Connection... Calibration...

228
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,910
It'll be all-nighters, no doubt.

229
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,740
Sorry for being so unreasonable.

230
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,950
But you want to go back to Central as soon as possible, right?

231
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,210
Then we'll work to make that happen!

232
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:48,960
But we'll charge extra for the express fee!

233
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,720
It's finished.

234
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,430
Thanks.

235
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,520
I don't see Edward Elric around.

236
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,270
Yeah, he said that he was visiting his mother's grave.

237
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,280
Major.

238
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,540
What kind of lives have those boys been living?

239
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,790
They don't even send us a single letter.

240
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:33,210
They are famous alchemists, even in Central.

241
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:37,010
That drags them into trouble, as well...

242
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:41,260
But don't worry. Those boys are strong.

243
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,390
Are they?

244
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,020
That makes me feel better, at least.

245
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,820
Are those two like grandchildren to you?

246
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,280
I've been watching over them ever since they were born.

247
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,660
Their father was an old drinking buddy of mine,

248
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,080
but he left the village, leaving his wife and children behind.

249
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,330
I don't even know if he's still alive.

250
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,140
Now that I think about it, where are Miss Winry's parents?

251
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,720
They died.

252
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,640
During the Ishbalan war.

253
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:31,940
My son... her parents... were surgeons.

254
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:36,150
They left for the battlefield because there was a shortage of doctors, but...

255
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:39,150
It was a horrible war.

256
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,450
It sure was.

257
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,950
Oh, shucks.

258
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,460
It's about time to start preparing supper.

259
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,880
You look like you'd eat a lot,
so you can expect a big dinner.

260
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,170
Oh no, I can't trouble you any further...

261
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,380
A meal tastes better with more people at the table.

262
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,590
There's an extra bed open for patients, so you can sleep there.

263
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,970
This is the only place those brothers can stay, anyway.

264
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,600
Adding an extra guest won't make a difference.

265
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,980
What about their home?

266
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,610
It's gone.

267
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,280
They don't have a home to return to.

268
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:26,450
They burnt their house down the day Ed decided to leave this village after getting his state qualification.

269
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:33,250
They probably did it to make sure there would be no going back.

270
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,800
Let's go back.

271
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,590
They're all waiting for us.

272
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:48,310
We're ba-

273
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,220
Edward Elric!

274
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,230
Your innocent love that drove you to attempt to revive your mother!

275
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:01,780
Your tremendous love that drove you to affix your brother's soul while prepared to throw your own life away!

276
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:07,410
Your unearthly determination that drove you to destroy your way out by burning down your home filled with memories!

277
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:11,330
Accept my embrace!!!

278
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,250
Get away! It's too hot!

279
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,540
Stop it!!!

280
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,610
Wow, you guys are at it already! So early in the morning, too!

281
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:38,900
We've been working all night.

282
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,870
Wow, it's so late and you guys are still working!

283
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,280
You'll be done pretty soon at this rate, won't ya?!

284
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,990
Another all-nighter tonight.

285
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,540
Wha...

286
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,090
Out!

287
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,850
They said they'd get it done in three days, so wait patiently.

288
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:21,770
I know, but I just can't sit still when I know a secret to the Philosopher's Stone lies in Central!

289
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,700
Sorry for the wait! We're done!

290
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,410
You up for this?

291
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,490
Y-Yeah.

292
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,370
Ready...

293
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,290
Set...

294
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,040
Go!

295
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,710
This feeling of connecting my nerves gets me every time.

296
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:46,720
Well, I won't have to deal with this pain once I get the Philosopher's Stone!

297
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,840
That's too bad. You were a real money-spinner.

298
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,350
Yeah. There's no need to go through the trouble of getting your limbs back!

299
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,140
And besides, what's wrong with this?

300
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,850
The smell of oil, the groaning of bearings...

301
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:04,690
This beautiful form that was designed based on human engineering!

302
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,940
Ah, how amazing!

303
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,490
Automails, that is!

304
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,820
Machine freak.

305
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,950
Shut up, Alchemy freak.

306
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,490
All right, it's complete!

307
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,250
How is it?

308
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,370
Yeah! Feels great!

309
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:24,300
We raised the ratio of chromium this time so it would be more resistant to rust.

310
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:28,130
But that makes it less durable, so don't overuse-

311
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,630
Hey, listen to me!

312
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,720
Al, sorry for the wait!

313
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,720
Will you be able to fix him quickly?

314
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,350
Yeah. There's a trick to it, though.

315
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:43,360
This seal right here acts as the mediator between Al's soul and this suit,

316
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,650
so I have to make sure I don't mess it up.

317
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,120
There! Perfect!

318
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,740
What do you say we test it out!

319
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:56,870
Sure!

320
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,250
It'll get quiet around here.

321
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,170
It's finally time!

322
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:09,010
We're going to go find Dr. Marcoh's data at Central!

323
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,720
We're leaving on the first train tomorrow!

324
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:26,020
He's sleeping with his belly out, again.

325
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,480
Seriously...

326
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,940
You're like his guardian, Al.

327
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,030
It's a pain having such a needy brother.

328
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,240
How old are you boys now?

329
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,540
I'm fourteen, and Brother is fifteen.

330
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:48,130
He's so short, the same age as me,
and they call him a human weapon?

331
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,720
Look how defenseless he is right now.

332
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,180
Thanks a lot, you two.

333
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,510
What's this formality all of a sudden?

334
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:02,730
You've always welcomed us as family. I'm really thankful of you two.

335
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,190
He might not say it, but Brother feels the same way.

336
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,730
Al...

337
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,900
Hey, we know.

338
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,610
You don't need to say it.

339
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,490
Granny... Winry...

340
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,450
Thank you.

341
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,420
Thanks for everything, Granny.

342
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,250
Sure.

343
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,460
Huh? Where's Winry?

344
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,670
Her last few nights have all been all-nighters, so I bet she's exhausted.

345
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,130
Want me to go wake her up?

346
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:34,010
Nah, don't worry about it.

347
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:37,050
She'll just keep on ranting about maintenance and all that stuff.

348
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:37,930
Later.

349
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,850
Hey, you two.

350
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,690
Stop by for a meal every once in a while, will ya?

351
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:45,900
We will.

352
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,940
Coming to a place so deep in the mountains just for a meal?

353
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,690
Ed, Al.

354
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,950
Have a safe trip...

355
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:00,830
Yup!

356
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:14,010
Say, the sky we saw that day, the scarlet sky.

357
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:14,010
Ano hi mita sora akaneiro no sora wo

358
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:19,220
Do you remember it from that day?

359
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:19,220
Nee kimi wa oboeteimasuka

360
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:25,140
We made a promise and a vow while the early summer wind circled us.

361
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:25,140
Yakusoku chigiri shoka no kaze ga tsutsumu

362
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:29,400
And we clung close together.

363
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:29,400
Futari yorisotta

364
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:38,450
Your forced smile

365
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:38,450
Muri na egao no ura

366
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:43,830
Holds elongated shadows.

367
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:43,830
Nobita kage wo kakumau

368
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:53,090
I pretend not to notice and continue on.

369
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:53,090
Dakara kizukanu furi saisei wo erabu

370
00:22:54,710 --> 00:23:02,600
Teeburu no ue no furuenai shirase machitsuzukete

371
00:22:54,710 --> 00:23:02,600
All the while waiting for you to deliver some news at the table.

372
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:10,980
Empty nights, mornings that will never arrive,

373
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:10,980
Kuuhaku no yoru mo kuru hazu no nai asa mo

374
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:15,740
I could see them from a mile away.

375
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:15,740
Zenbu wakattetanda

376
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:21,370
Say, the sky we saw that day, the scarlet sky.

377
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:21,370
Ano hi mita sora akaneiro no sora wo

378
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:26,290
I'm sure you'll remember it one day.

379
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:26,290
Nee itsuka omoidasu deshou

380
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:32,130
While holding the promise we couldn't keep,

381
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:32,130
Hatasenakatta yakusoku wo idaite

382
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:36,380
Futari arukidasu

383
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:36,380
We take our first steps down our own paths.

384
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,600
I slept for the whole day.

385
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,980
Seriously... this place turns into a battlefield whenever he comes.

386
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,190
Oh.

387
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,980
Whoops?

388
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:02,530
Clues to the Philosopher's Stone are certainly there.

389
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:06,740
However, the enemy's evil hand has seized its target,

390
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:14,040
and the boys are drawn into a labyrinth by the real truth that is beyond the truth.

391
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,210
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

392
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,160
Hidden Truths

393
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,220
Episode 7, Hidden Truths.

394
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:25,810
If you wish to reach it, you must not avert your eyes.
