1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,890
Alchemy is a science where one understands the structure of matter, breaks it down, then rebuilds it.

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:11,560
However, it is not an all-powerful technique,
as one cannot create something out of nothing.

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:17,570
If one wishes to gain something,
one must present something of equal value.

4
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:22,110
This is the concept of equivalent exchange, the fundamental basis of alchemy.

5
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,700
However, there is a taboo in alchemy. Human transmutation.

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,040
One must not commit this act.

7
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,930
I've still got a lot of years ahead of me

8
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,930
Kono omoi wo keshiteshimau niwa

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,840
To just erase these feelings?

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,930
Mada jinsei nagai desho?

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:35,890
To just erase these feelings?

12
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:35,930
To just erase these feelings?

13
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,930
Yarinokoshiteru koto

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,930
I want to go back and finish

15
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,560
The things that I've yet to finish.

16
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,560
Yarinaoshite mitai kara

17
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:58,830
I was supposed to be chasing after my ongoing dream,

18
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:58,830
Yume no tsuzuki oikaketeita hazu nanoni

19
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:05,170
Yet I faltered over others while walking this thin, winding path.

20
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:05,170
Magarikunetta hosoi michi hito ni tsumazuku

21
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,340
It's not that I want to return to those days.

22
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,340
Ano koro mitainitte modoritai wake ja nai no

23
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,840
I'm searching for the sky I lost.

24
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,840
Nakushitekita sora wo sagashiteru

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,510
Don't make that sad face, as if you've fallen victim.

26
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,510
Wakatte kuremasu youni

27
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:18,720
As if you want people to pity you.

28
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:18,720
Gisei ni natta youna kanashii kao wa yameteyo

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,430
Tears aren't the end of your sins.

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,430
Tsumi no saigo wa namida ja nai yo

31
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,100
You have to bear them painfully, forever.

32
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,100
Zutto kurushiku seottekunda

33
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,770
Who are you waiting for in the maze of emotions,

34
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,770
Deguchi mienai kanjoumeiro ni

35
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,440
Where you can't even see the exit?

36
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,440
Dare wo matteruno?

37
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,230
I want to blurt it out more justly,

38
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,230
Shiroi nooto ni tsuzutta youni

39
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,980
Motto sunao ni hakidashitai yo

40
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,980
Just like how I wrote it in my white notebook.

41
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,650
What do you want to run from?

42
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,650
Nani kara nogaretainda

43
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,280
That thing called "reality"?

44
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,280
Genjitsu tte yatsu?

45
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,610
I just want to scream out,

46
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,610
Kanaeru tame ni ikiterundatte

47
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,030
"I'm only living to fulfill my wish." Can you hear me?

48
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,030
Sakebitaku naru yo kikoeteimasuka?

49
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,160
I can't take the safe way out of everything.

50
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,160
Bunan ni nante yatterarenaikara

51
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,960
I don't even have a place to return to.

52
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,960
Kaeru basho mo nai no

53
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,250
Yasashisa ni wa itsumo kansha shiteru

54
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,250
I'm always thankful for everyone's kindness,

55
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,630
That's why I want to become stronger. (I'm on the way)

56
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,630
Dakara tsuyoku naritai (I'm on the way)

57
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,590
This is reminding me of the old days.

58
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,590
Natsukashiku naru

59
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,840
This pain is all right with me.

60
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,840
Konna itami mo kangei jan

61
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,010
Maes Hughes is dead.

62
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,970
He was murdered by mysterious people who have tattoos of Ouroboros.

63
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,850
Mustang, doubtful of the reason behind Hughes' death, upon learning the military leadership had a hand in the plot,

64
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,520
decided to make his way to Central.

65
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:28,320
At the same time, Ed and Al, knowing nothing of this, headed south with Winry toward Dublith where their master lives.

66
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,660
However...

67
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,020
Miracle at Rush Valley

68
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,000
Rush Valley!

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,500
Automail!

70
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,000
Automail~

71
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,500
Automail!

72
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,880
I'm so blessed!

73
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,470
It's a Gotts eleventh year model!

74
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,180
I never thought I'd be able to lay my eyes on one!

75
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,900
As expected from the Holy Land of Automails.

76
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,690
This place is packed.

77
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:08,740
Where's the fun in staring at automails all day in this hot weather?

78
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,740
We should have just left Winry
and headed straight for Dublith!

79
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,000
Hey you, do you have a moment?

80
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,830
This automail's a rare make.

81
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,500
You're right. Take a look, everyone.

82
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:23,920
Hey.

83
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,920
Hey, whoa-

84
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,090
Cut it out! C-Cut it-

85
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,380
I said cut it out! N-Not there!

86
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,340
No! N-No!!!

87
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,010
Everyone's so eager to learn!

88
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,850
Get off me!

89
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,150
Geez... This is why I can't stand automail mechanics...

90
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,520
U-Umm...

91
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,940
Huh?

92
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,980
What's wrong?

93
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,650
I can't find it...

94
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,780
Find what?

95
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,780
The sign of a State Alchemist...

96
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,370
...my silver pocket watch!

97
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,700
I can't find it.

98
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,790
That's probably Paninya's doing.

99
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,210
Paninya?

100
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,090
She's a pickpocket who goes after tourists.

101
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,260
Any idea where she is?

102
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,010
It's something really important!

103
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,880
I don't mind telling ya...

104
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,970
...But in exchange...

105
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,600
Let me see your automail one last...

106
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,350
She's at an automail mechanic by the name of Dominique's place!

107
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:31,030
They said he lives deep in the mountains because you can find high quality ore, but...

108
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,030
This really is the right path... right?

109
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,490
They didn't trick us, did they?

110
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:42,580
It's your fault for saying you wanted to go to that city in the first place!

111
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,630
Getting your silver pocket watch stolen was due to your own carelessness!

112
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,590
Shut up!

113
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,260
Hey, you two!

114
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,050
What do you want?!

115
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,670
Isn't that the girl?

116
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,900
Found her!!!

117
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,040
Give it back...

118
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,210
You're amazing! What the heck are you?

119
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,880
I'm... an alchemist!

120
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,130
Wow, awesome!

121
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,390
Moving about so much...

122
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,020
Hey, you're running out of breath!

123
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,810
I've been waiting for you.

124
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,200
Well done!

125
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,240
What do you say you give it back now...

126
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,160
...my silver pocket watch...

127
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,330
It's not really a rare sight, is it?
Considering the city you were just at.

128
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,540
And also...

129
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:11,340
A 1.5 inch culverin in my left leg.

130
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:12,880
Wait!

131
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,380
Catch me if you can!

132
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,350
Don't even try to escape!

133
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,100
Good work, Winry! Don't let go of her!

134
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,770
That's the plan!

135
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,440
I won't let go of you until you let me examine your automail!

136
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,950
Oh my, Paninya.

137
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,580
You brought friends over?

138
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,200
Give up already!

139
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,540
Well, about that...

140
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,710
It's my first time seeing an automail like this!

141
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,380
The suspension is powerful, but what's even more amazing is the overall balance!

142
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,630
This efficient design is a work of art!

143
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,720
Umm... about my silver pocket watch...

144
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,510
This is amazing! How did they do this?

145
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,510
It's no use, Brother...

146
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:06,980
You have my deepest respect for being able to make such an automail!

147
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:10,360
No, I'm not the one who made it.

148
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,360
It's mine.

149
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,370
Isn't it a bit heavy?

150
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,410
Yeah... I agree.

151
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,160
It's not good to put a strain on the recipient.

152
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,540
Maybe that's why this guy's so small?

153
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,830
Don't call me small!

154
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,920
Which means I'd get bigger if it's made lighter.

155
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,840
There's a possibility.

156
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,760
You're huge, Brother!

157
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,430
You're so tall!

158
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,470
You guys are so puny.

159
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,810
I've decided.

160
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,980
Mister Dominique!

161
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,980
Hmm?

162
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,770
Please make me your apprentice!

163
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,780
No can do.

164
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,530
You could at least give it a little more thought...

165
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,780
Shut up. I don't take apprentices.

166
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,700
I'm begging you!

167
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:07,500
Could you please teach her how to build an automail that would help me grow?

168
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,790
Shut up, flea.

169
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,630
Sorry about that.

170
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,720
My old man's pretty stubborn.

171
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,550
Yeah...

172
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,930
Flea... Flea...

173
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,770
Flea...

174
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:29,770
Hm?

175
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,020
That's... a baby, right?

176
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,490
That's right.

177
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,570
Can I feel your belly?

178
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,530
Sure, go ahead.

179
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,640
It's kind of mysterious.

180
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,850
Yeah.

181
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:12,100
It's weird to think we were in
our mom's womb like this once, too...

182
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,610
Are you all right?!

183
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,360
Y-Yeah...

184
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:26,160
The junctions start to ache when the weather is no good.

185
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,370
Why do you wear an automail?

186
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,540
I lost both my parents and my legs in a train accident.

187
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,920
It really felt like the end of the world for me,

188
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:46,430
since I had no relatives, nor was I able to walk at all.

189
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,350
And that's when I met Mister Dominique.

190
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,490
You've got a look saying,
"I'm the most miserable person in the world".

191
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,370
Ones like you piss me off the most!

192
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,160
Let me go! Let me go!

193
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,540
Eyes of a corpse.

194
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,710
I probably looked dreadful back then...

195
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:25,380
And so, while I had no idea what was going on, he stuck these on me.

196
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:31,390
The surgery was painful, and the rehab was backbreaking; everything was horrible.

197
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,560
But...

198
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,480
When I was able to stand on my feet again,
I felt like the world was mine.

199
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:46,070
I'm really thankful to Mister Dominique.

200
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,910
I plan on repaying the debt,
even if it takes my whole life to do it.

201
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:54,500
Even though I've never gotten him to accept any kind of payment...

202
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,080
So that's why you pickpocket...

203
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:01,210
If you're truly thankful, then stop pickpocketing!

204
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:01,840
Huh?

205
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:06,170
Mister Dominique gave you these legs in good faith.

206
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,510
So you have to respond to that with the same, too!

207
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:15,850
If you're really planning on spending your whole life trying to repay him, stand up and work hard to earn money!

208
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,690
With those legs he gave you!

209
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:24,190
I'm sure that would make Mister Dominique much happier.

210
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,150
I see...

211
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,120
You're right!

212
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,530
Yeah! I'll stop pickpocketing!

213
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,450
I'll repay him by earning money honestly!

214
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,000
Oh, that's right...

215
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,160
I have to give this back to him.

216
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,120
Right!

217
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,920
Huh?

218
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,630
Uh-oh... Did I break it?

219
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,300
It won't open...

220
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,470
Let me see.

221
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,430
No, he's sealed it with alchemy.

222
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,220
How come?

223
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,970
The answer is obvious.

224
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,850
Because there's something embarrassing in here he doesn't want anyone else to see!

225
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,070
Got it!

226
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,530
Now, let's see what Ed's got in here...

227
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,450
"Don't forget. 3. Oct. 11."

228
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,120
What is this?

229
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,130
Please give this back to Ed.

230
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,540
Winry?

231
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,250
I'm...

232
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,050
I'm going to try asking Mister Dominique for an apprenticeship again!

233
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,390
What's wrong?

234
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,480
B-Being bo...

235
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,850
Bingo?

236
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,730
Being bo... Bo...

237
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,690
What about bingo?

238
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,360
B...

239
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,320
B-

240
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,490
Miss Sadila says the baby's being born!!!

241
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,880
We can't take her to a hospital in the city in this weather.

242
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,340
I'll rush over there and bring back a doctor.

243
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,640
My old man will be back with a doctor soon.

244
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,930
Just hang in there, okay?

245
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,270
I can't exactly "hang in there"
if the baby's trying to come out...

246
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,520
What's wrong?!

247
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,820
What's she saying? I can't make it out.

248
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,450
The baby's being born!

249
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,200
B... B... Being born?!

250
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,450
What are we going to do?! There's no doctor around!

251
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,960
What are we going to do?! What are we going to do?!

252
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,040
Hey, you! What are we going to do?!

253
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,380
We have to do it!

254
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,300
Do what?

255
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,550
The delivery.

256
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,760
What?!

257
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,890
D-Do you have experience delivering a baby?

258
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:00,010
I don't. But...

259
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,680
We don't have time to sit around, either!

260
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,400
We need to work together to help the baby be born!

261
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,860
Ed and Al, you two go boil some water!

262
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,900
Got it!

263
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,190
Paninya, collect all the towels you can find!

264
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,110
Roger!

265
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:17,910
And Mr. Riddle, do you have any rubbing alcohol?

266
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,660
I think we have some in the storehouse!

267
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,500
Oh, and please prepare some water for Miss Sadila to drink!

268
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,550
Say... Do you think she can handle this?

269
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,300
She was born into a family of doctors,

270
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:38,260
so she basically grew up reading medical books.

271
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,220
Yup.

272
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,890
What?! Then that means she didn't actually study how to...

273
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:46,230
I'm sure she only remembers those things vaguely.

274
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,560
No way...

275
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,860
But right now,

276
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,980
we need to put faith in her knowledge and courage.

277
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,530
First, boil water, then sterilization...

278
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,740
What else is there to do?

279
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,910
Try to remember... Try to remember...

280
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,120
Winry.

281
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,920
You can do it!

282
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,000
Yeah.

283
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,300
Paninya, help me out in here.

284
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,970
O-Okay.

285
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,650
Brother...

286
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,570
I'm always powerless in critical moments...

287
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,820
Oww! Oww! Oww! Oww!!!

288
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,330
I'm going to die!

289
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,160
It hurts so much!

290
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,830
I can't take it anymore!!!

291
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,500
I don't believe in God, but...

292
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,840
Yeah.

293
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:59,090
If you exist, then please... just for now...

294
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,150
Brother!

295
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,820
H-Hey!

296
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:20,200
B-Blood...

297
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,860
I can't... take it...

298
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,200
What happened? Hey!

299
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,430
She did it!

300
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,680
Hooray!

301
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,180
That's awesome! The baby was really born!

302
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,480
That's so awesome! Awesome, I tell you!

303
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,570
You sound like a little kid saying that.

304
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,440
Think about it! It's the birth of a life!

305
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:03,200
It's what alchemists have been spending hundreds of years trying to do.

306
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,450
A human creating a human.

307
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:09,500
Don't group alchemy with the mysteries of life.

308
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,080
I can't help it; I'm an alchemist.

309
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,750
But still, that's awesome.

310
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,840
Humans are awesome.

311
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,430
Well, since the baby was safely born,

312
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,930
is there anything I can help out with?

313
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,680
Good question.

314
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,140
For starters, help me up...

315
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,140
Huh?

316
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:37,320
It's humiliating to be carried by a guy shorter than me.

317
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,980
Don't make me drop you.

318
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,610
Ed...

319
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,490
Hm?

320
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,820
I saw what you wrote inside your silver pocket watch...

321
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,870
Oww...

322
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,580
Did you force it open?

323
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,010
Sorry...

324
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,640
Idiot.

325
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,610
I haven't even shown it to Al.

326
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:21,610
But why?

327
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,530
A lesson for myself and to show my determination.

328
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,120
It's kind of girly of me.

329
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,830
That I have to hold on to that day in a shape like this...

330
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,800
Why are you  crying?

331
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,310
There's no going back now...

332
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:57,690
Yeah.

333
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,580
Why are you  crying?

334
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:21,040
I'm crying for  you, since neither you nor Al ever cry.

335
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,840
Idiot.

336
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,800
Hey... I think you should go back to Resembool.

337
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,720
Granny's probably lonely being all by herself.

338
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,510
No, I'm not going back.

339
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,430
Hey...

340
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,060
After seeing your determination...

341
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:42,770
I can't be walking around with
half-assed determination, either.

342
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,530
No, it's not like you have to carry the burden either...

343
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,860
I want to keep getting better,

344
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,660
so I can equip you with better automail.

345
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,450
So you can continue your journey with peace of mind.

346
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,960
So I'm going to try asking Mister Dominique for an apprenticeship again!

347
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,340
I see...

348
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:06,800
Good luck.

349
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,260
Thanks.

350
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:12,800
Winry, Mister Riddle wants to see you.

351
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:15,060
Huh? What's the matter?

352
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,520
No, it's nothing. I'll be right there.

353
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,940
Paninya...

354
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,020
Oww! What was that for?!

355
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,650
Shut up! Give me my watch back, you thief!

356
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,450
You didn't have to hit me with your right hand!

357
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,070
Then I'll hit you again with my left!

358
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,410
It's your grandpa!

359
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,910
So cute!

360
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,250
His personality's changed...

361
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,920
Both you and your baby are in excellent condition.

362
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,960
The post-birth care was also very well done.

363
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:50,840
Even an adult would panic if they happened to witness childbirth for the first time.

364
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,680
Oh! Well... I panicked a little.

365
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,760
I owe all of you a huge thank you.

366
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,140
Especially you, young lady.

367
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,560
Thank you so much.

368
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,360
Please don't be so formal!

369
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,110
Oh, geez... I'm embarrassed.

370
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,990
How about it? Taking an apprentice here might be a...

371
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,870
This and that are two different things.

372
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,580
I won't take any apprentices.

373
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,330
But, if you insist...

374
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:25,630
I'll introduce you to a skilled technician that lives at the foot of the mountain.

375
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,760
U-Umm...

376
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,970
Can I visit to observe your work from time to time?

377
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:37,600
You can come visit to see my grandchild, sure.

378
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,140
You, too, Paninya!

379
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,690
Oh no! Hurry!

380
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:51,740
If we miss it, we're going to have to wait
another three days for the next train to Dublith!

381
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,490
Take care of yourselves, now!

382
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,490
You, too!

383
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,910
Be sure you give Granny a call!

384
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,410
I don't want to hear that from you !

385
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,790
Make sure you steal that geezer's techniques,

386
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:10,630
so you can equip me with a
better automail the next time you see me!

387
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,760
And there he goes.

388
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,010
You can count on me.

389
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:33,090
Say, the sky we saw that day, the scarlet sky.

390
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:33,090
Ano hi mita sora akaneiro no sora wo

391
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:38,310
Do you remember it from that day?

392
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:38,310
Nee kimi wa oboeteimasuka

393
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:44,230
We made a promise and a vow while the early summer wind circled us.

394
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:44,230
Yakusoku chigiri shoka no kaze ga tsutsumu

395
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,480
And we clung close together.

396
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,480
Futari yorisotta

397
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:57,530
Your forced smile

398
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:57,530
Muri na egao no ura

399
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:02,910
Holds elongated shadows.

400
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:02,910
Nobita kage wo kakumau

401
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:12,170
I pretend not to notice and continue on.

402
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:12,170
Dakara kizukanu furi saisei wo erabu

403
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:21,680
All the while waiting for you to deliver some news at the table.

404
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:21,680
Teeburu no ue no furuenai shirase machitsuzukete

405
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:30,070
Empty nights, mornings that will never arrive,

406
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:30,070
Kuuhaku no yoru mo kuru hazu no nai asa mo

407
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:34,820
I could see them from a mile away.

408
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:34,820
Zenbu wakattetanda

409
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:40,450
Say, the sky we saw that day, the scarlet sky.

410
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:40,450
Ano hi mita sora akaneiro no sora wo

411
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:45,370
Nee itsuka omoidasu deshou

412
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:45,370
I'm sure you'll remember it one day.

413
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:51,210
While holding the promise we couldn't keep,

414
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:51,210
Hatasenakatta yakusoku wo idaite

415
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:55,470
We take our first steps down our own paths.

416
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:55,470
Futari arukidasu

417
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,050
The boys reminisce of the times they were in training...

418
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:05,550
...when they visit Dublith, the city where their master lives.

419
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,600
That becomes their first step toward the truth.

420
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:15,230
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

421
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:20,230
Episode 12, One is All, All is One.

422
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,250
One is All, All is One

423
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,780
He hesitates to speak,

424
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,660
because he wants to protect them.
