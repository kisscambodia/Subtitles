1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:06,190
Drawn by a landscape as white as snow,

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:06,190
Masshiro na keshiki ni ima sasowarete

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,740
I'm headed toward an unseen world.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,740
Boku wa yuku yo mada minu sekai e

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,680
I've been traveling while lost

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,680
Maigo no mama tabi shiteita

7
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,470
Under this gray sky.

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,460
Nezumiiro no sora no shita

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,560
Every day with new maps, stained with my many dreams.

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,560
Higawari no chizu ikutsumo no yume ga nijindeita

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,950
I wonder if someday,

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,950
Itsuka wa sa

13
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,990
Chippoke na boku no kono hohaba demo

14
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,990
Even with these tiny steps of mine,

15
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:43,070
I'll be able to travel beyond those clouds.

16
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:43,070
Ano kumo no mukou made yukeru kana

17
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,700
I put on a bold front.

18
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,700
Tsuyogatte

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,250
End up hurting myself.

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,250
Kizutsuita

21
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,330
I feel empty inside.

22
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,330
Kokoro sukashita youni

23
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,870
It's started to rain,

24
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,870
Furidashita

25
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,040
And the raindrops

26
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,040
Amatsubu tachi ga

27
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,260
Began to repeat their scattered reflections.

28
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,260
Ranhansha kurikaesu

29
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,130
These straight rays of light

30
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,130
Massugu na hikari ga

31
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,850
Start to cross one another.

32
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,850
Kousa shite

33
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,430
And without telling anyone where they're headed,

34
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,430
Yakusaki mo tsugenumama

35
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,720
Across the endless distances,

36
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,720
Doko made mo

37
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,310
They pass through all matter.

38
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,310
Tsukinukeru

39
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:14,140
Awai zanzou ryoume ni yakitsukete

40
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:14,140
I burn these faint afterimages onto my eyes.

41
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,060
Under this sky,

42
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,060
Kono sora no shita

43
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,890
Wherever I am,

44
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,890
Donna toko ni itemo

45
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,190
I should be able to reach

46
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,190
Todoku hazu nanda

47
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:27,000
The unseen world.

48
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:27,000
Mada minu sekai e

49
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,810
This is the bullet used in the murder of Brigadier General Hughes.

50
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,730
.45 caliber, and only one shot was fired.

51
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:54,190
I'd like to say the murderer was skilled, but it was a close proximity shot.

52
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,200
Not impossible for a woman to do.

53
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,830
What is the caliber of your gun?

54
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,460
.45.

55
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,090
This is your ammunition request application.

56
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,670
Am I right?

57
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,840
It's written here you only needed to be supplied with one shot.

58
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,470
What did you use it for?

59
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,220
As it says right there,

60
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,100
I used it at Research Laboratory 5, while I escorted Edward Elric...

61
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,190
But Research Laboratory 5 is closed down, and there shouldn't be anyone there.

62
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,980
But there were.

63
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,490
...According to you.

64
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,740
Should I order a search for this bullet you supposedly shot?

65
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,910
Research Laboratory 5 is in ruins now due to an unknown explosion.

66
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,920
So the place where you say you used
your gun is usually unvisited by people,

67
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,010
and even if we wanted to search for
the bullet, it'd be under a heap of rubble...

68
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:06,680
There's witness testimony stating you left the scene of the crime, on the exact date and time it occurred.

69
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,980
That's ridiculous!

70
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,980
Compose yourself.

71
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,230
What were you doing at the time?

72
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,820
I was on leave that day and at my parents' house.

73
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,490
You can confirm with them.

74
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,580
Testimony from family members or people whom you are close with cannot be accepted as an alibi.

75
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,670
Second Lieutenant Maria Ross is currently being interrogated.

76
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,710
Though you may be her superior, I cannot allow you to see her.

77
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,170
I see...

78
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,180
Major Armstrong!

79
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,600
Sergeant Brosh.

80
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,680
You were here, too, Major?

81
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,600
Yeah. Are you here for Second Lieutenant Ross?

82
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,890
Yes. The truth is-

83
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:59,570
The truth is, like the lieutenant, I also fired one round at Research Laboratory 5 while escorting the Elric Brothers.

84
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,490
What?

85
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,240
I reported that, but they didn't listen at all.

86
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,790
So they're planning on passing her off as the murderer?

87
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,500
Cold Flame

88
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,310
Now that I look closely, you're really scratched up.

89
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,180
Not an easy journey, huh?

90
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,190
Say, what are you going to do now?

91
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,700
Hey...

92
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,790
I wonder...

93
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,920
Mama, don't cry.

94
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,130
What do you want me to do?

95
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,350
What?

96
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,900
No, it's just that you've never asked me for advice about something concerning yourselves...

97
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,270
Oh...

98
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,910
It really scares me.

99
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:33,330
Both of you are fighting in a place so dangerous that Mr. Hughes was killed.

100
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,210
I got really scared when I thought about that.

101
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,090
Because... you both could die.

102
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,590
And suddenly disappear from my side.

103
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,350
Just like Mom and Dad...

104
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,440
I got really scared when I thought about that.

105
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,400
To be honest, I want you to end your journey.

106
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,570
I want you two to get your bodies back.

107
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,410
But I don't want you to go on any dangerous journeys.

108
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,290
Because...

109
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,460
But...

110
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,750
Sorry.

111
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,220
I don't really know what I want either.

112
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,720
You're really kind, Winry.

113
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,140
Huh?! W-W-What are you saying?

114
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,980
I'm always kind!

115
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,270
Stop! You're going to scratch me up even more!

116
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,440
PLACEHOLDER

117
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,360
Geez Al, what are you saying?

118
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,030
There.

119
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,530
Evening paper!

120
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,950
Finally!

121
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,700
What, the paper again?

122
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,170
I'm forced to watch over you all day.

123
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,210
This is about the only thing I can look forward to.

124
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,550
Warrant Officer Falman speaking. I'm calling from an outside line.

125
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,510
Please put me through to Colonel Mustang.

126
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,970
That's right. My code is...

127
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,180
What's the deal?

128
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,940
Airam, George, Oliver, 4649.

129
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,690
It's that lady from back then!

130
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,200
Philosopher's stones...

131
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,200
Ones who have tattoos of Ouroboros...

132
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,080
Homunculus...

133
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,620
How are they...

134
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,500
Brother!

135
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,830
Look at this...

136
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,000
Don't scare me like that.

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,710
I... got this from the front desk!

138
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,380
What is it?

139
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,550
What?!

140
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:58,980
"Second Lieutenant Maria Ross convicted on charges of the murder of Brigadier General Hughes"?!

141
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,270
I don't believe this.

142
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:06,360
Maybe the colonel or the major might know something.

143
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,820
Aren't you going to tell Winry?

144
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,780
I'll explain it to her later.

145
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,370
I don't like this thing.

146
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,830
Quit complaining. It's kind of like a collar for a dog.

147
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,910
Oh, and I'm going to ask again just to be sure...

148
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,170
Are you really fifteen?

149
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,670
Yeah.

150
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,040
Stop lying.

151
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,420
But it's true...

152
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,420
What's all this?

153
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,340
What's going on?

154
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,470
An intruder!

155
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,760
Please lend us a hand!

156
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,680
What?!

157
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,680
You'd better behave!

158
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,430
Yes, sir!

159
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,060
Weak, weak, weak!

160
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,690
Are you guys even trying?!

161
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,570
What's with this guy?!

162
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,070
Guns aren't working at all!

163
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,320
Move!

164
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:53,950
You-

165
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,660
Whoa!

166
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,010
But it's awfully boring not being allowed to cut them.

167
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,090
Hello! Guy who's not affected by guns!

168
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,140
Could you let me out of here?

169
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,760
Who are you?

170
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,890
An illegal alien from Xing.

171
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,220
Oh, I see.

172
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,730
Must have been a long trip.

173
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,600
I'll help you if you let me out!

174
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,110
I don't have time to mess around with you...

175
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,030
What country did you say you're from?

176
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,610
Xing of the East.

177
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,740
Come with me.

178
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,910
Thanks.

179
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,330
What?

180
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,880
Hello, Honey!

181
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,760
I've finally found you!

182
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,310
You were at Research Laboratory 5-

183
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,230
I'm glad you remember me.

184
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:10,360
I think of you every time I see the hole in my right hand you shot through.

185
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,320
Ms. Murderer of Hughes.

186
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,150
That's a misunderstanding!

187
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,530
Is it really?

188
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:20,030
The paper says it's confirmed.

189
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,160
No way...

190
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:26,750
At this rate, it looks like you're going to have the guilt pinned on you and get executed by a firing squad.

191
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,540
You're kidding...

192
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,500
There's no way... If they investigate thoroughly-

193
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,750
Make a decision!

194
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:36,760
Get tortured to death by these guys or escape with me!

195
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,090
Those are the two choices you've got!

196
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,390
That's horrible...

197
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,730
Are those the only choices available?

198
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,390
Looks that way.

199
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,270
God, damn it!

200
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:55,570
Mom, Dad, I'm sorry!

201
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,280
Fine, I'll escape. Happy?

202
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,450
You'd better escort me, you stupid bone armor!

203
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,660
Wow, you've got spunk.

204
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,500
Women have to have guts!

205
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,710
Yes.

206
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,250
Yes, I understand.

207
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,630
Notify the entire city.

208
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,140
Maria Ross has escaped from jail.

209
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,270
She's with a fiendish partner. Capture her immediately.

210
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,020
If she resists...

211
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,060
...don't hesitate to kill her!

212
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,440
How much longer are we going to run?!

213
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,360
Shut up and keep running!

214
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,580
Second Lieutenant Ross?!

215
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,490
Edward! Alphonse!

216
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,670
Hey! You're that guy from-

217
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,210
And Ling, too?!

218
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,170
Hiya!

219
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,710
What are you guys up to?

220
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,800
That's what we should be asking!

221
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,550
We don't have much time!

222
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,220
You...

223
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,220
Lady, go straight down that alley to reach the warehouse district!

224
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,220
It's dark enough over there to make your escape!

225
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,100
Second Lieutenant Ross, about Lt. Colonel Hughes...

226
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,190
Hurry up! If the military police finds you, they'll shoot you dead!

227
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,020
Second Lieutenant Ross!

228
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,270
Don't follow her!

229
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,400
Second Lieutenant!

230
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,190
Second Lieutenant Ross!

231
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,540
You're Maria Ross, right?

232
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,760
What?!

233
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,550
Oh, so she did it?

234
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,510
Hey!

235
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,720
Hold it!

236
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,690
Whoa!

237
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,600
We're going, thin-eyes!

238
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,730
You got it!

239
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,730
Ling! Why are you working with a guy like that?!

240
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,480
We'll talk later!

241
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,490
Seriously...

242
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,500
Yo, Fullmetal.

243
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,000
What's the meaning of this...

244
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,630
What's the meaning of this, Colonel?!

245
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,530
Why...

246
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,030
Lt. Colonel Hughes was...

247
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,030
Why would Second Lieutenant Ross...

248
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,830
Why didn't you tell me in the first place?!

249
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,080
Attacking a superior?

250
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,250
Know your place!

251
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,180
You can't, Brother!

252
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,180
Let go of me, Al!

253
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,560
No!

254
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,980
This bastard just killed Second Lieutenant Ross!

255
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,770
Second Lieutenant Ross?

256
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,440
What is this, Colonel?!

257
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,490
There was a kill-on-sight order issued for Maria Ross, an escaped convict.

258
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,740
That's all there is to it.

259
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,370
"That's all"?!

260
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,960
I do apologize for hiding Hughes' death.

261
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:41,250
But do not object to orders. Do not seek explanation.

262
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,250
Simply obey.

263
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,510
That's what it means to be a soldier!

264
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,770
Colonel Mustang.

265
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,230
Explain the situation to me.

266
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,610
There should have been a notice issued saying if she resists, we could gun her down.

267
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,530
She resisted, so I killed her.

268
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,490
The Brigadier General was a good friend of yours from what I hear.

269
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,950
Yeah.

270
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,410
He was a good man.

271
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:24,050
It weren't your men who helped
Second Lieutenant Ross escape from jail, right?

272
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,210
Mine?

273
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,170
Why would I?

274
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,420
Why?

275
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,260
So you could burn her to death like that yourself.

276
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,770
I'd appreciate it if you didn't make assumptions.

277
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:52,530
I'm truly sorry for not telling you about Brigadier General Hughes' death.

278
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,790
Because of me...

279
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,710
Don't brood over it.

280
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,420
It is not your fault.

281
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,090
So you're all here.

282
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,340
Dr. Nox...

283
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,350
The damage is extensive.

284
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:19,850
But from a scar on her tooth that was just narrowly left unscathed, we were able to identify her as Maria Ross.

285
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,690
How horrible.

286
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,320
Turning a babe like that into charcoal.

287
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,990
You must have really had something against her, eh, Mr. Mustang?

288
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,830
Are you satisfied you were able to avenge your friend's death?

289
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:48,170
It makes me sick a hero from the Ishbal War
would go so far against a little girl.

290
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:58,600
Colonel, I can't express to you how sorry I am for what my subordinate did.

291
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,600
I had no idea Second Lieutenant Ross would murder...

292
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:08,020
She's always been honest... hardworking...

293
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:11,190
And thoughtful...

294
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,830
Looks like you're exhausted, Major.

295
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,500
Why not take a vacation?

296
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,510
Eastern Headquarters, where I used to be stationed, was great.

297
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:38,680
It lacks the bustle of large cities,
and most of all, there are so many beauties.

298
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:52,490
And so, Mustang was able to avenge his best friend.

299
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,030
And everyone lived happily ever after.

300
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,030
You petered out.

301
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,790
Wasn't the purpose of this mission to make the colonel behave?

302
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,450
Who cares?

303
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,830
The dog ate its bait.

304
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,340
And it seems he's provoking people's antipathy.

305
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,340
His own men may even be disgusted at him.

306
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,220
What's this?

307
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,470
Request for leave.

308
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,800
At this time of the year?

309
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,350
Is something wrong?

310
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,430
No, it's fine. I permit it.

311
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,270
Thank you very much.

312
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,450
Oh, for crying out loud!

313
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,750
Why did you leave this place?! There's no knowing what the colonel will say to me if he finds out!

314
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:50,460
No one saw me coming back.

315
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,500
That's not the problem here!

316
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,010
You're a poor soldier that's in the hands of a vicious criminal, so it's okay.

317
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,470
Huh?!

318
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,310
Yo, what are you doing?

319
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,560
Sending a signal.

320
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,730
Signal?

321
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,980
And besides, why did you bring back some random stranger?!

322
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,610
Young Master! We've looked all over for you!

323
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:17,030
Oh wow, that was quick.

324
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,240
More guests.

325
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,080
Hey Elizabeth! How are you?

326
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,330
Thanks for calling all the time.

327
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:32,210
But won't your scary aide scold you if you slack off too much?

328
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:35,710
It's all right! She's on leave right now.

329
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,300
Which is why I can call you like this.

330
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:41,890
What do you think?

331
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,770
This starts as soon as the lieutenant goes on vacation.

332
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,350
I guess she really was...

333
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,650
...His babysitter...

334
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,190
That's right!

335
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:55,480
I haven't had any days off since I came here.

336
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,650
So I'm thinking about taking a holiday soon.

337
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:00,660
Oh? Going somewhere?

338
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,910
I've gotten into fishing lately.

339
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,540
Want to come along?

340
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,590
Yes?

341
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,420
Who is it-

342
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:26,510
Why did you do that all of a sudden, Major?!

343
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,270
Edward Elric.

344
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,900
Oh no.

345
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,230
Your automail is broken.

346
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,150
Huh?

347
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,190
Yes. This is a serious situation.

348
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,030
We must get it fixed right away.

349
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,280
I'll escort you to Resembool.

350
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,160
Well, umm...

351
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,330
What? What?

352
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,290
We're going back to Resembool?

353
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,790
Al, listen to this...

354
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:59,170
Alphonse Elric, you stick out too much, so stay in Central.

355
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:02,220
All right! Let's make arrangements for the train ride.

356
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,550
Let's go, Edward Elric!

357
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:11,770
Can you cut it out already, Major?

358
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,100
No can do.

359
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,940
This is also an order.

360
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,440
From that man...

361
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,240
Yes, I understand.

362
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,950
Major Armstrong and Edward Elric just got on a train.

363
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,620
I see.

364
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,670
Now there are no hindrances.

365
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:46,090
I was able to come in contact with a witness who saw the guy who assaulted the prison.

366
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,850
And this is what he looks like.

367
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,350
Oh, he was alive?

368
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,350
I wonder if he has anything to do with the Flame Colonel?

369
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,650
Who knows?

370
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:58,110
But I think we can say for sure that there is a big possibility.

371
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,610
Where did he run off to?

372
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,530
Well, he's speedy, and to top it off,
he's also good at hiding...

373
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,780
So in other words, you don't know?

374
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,820
You're so incompetent.

375
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,910
Shut up, hag.

376
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,410
We don't have enough people, that's why.

377
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,500
People?

378
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,790
He's all we need.

379
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:23,170
You're up, Barry the Chopper.

380
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:37,420
I don't have to act tough, right?

381
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:37,420
Tsuyogaranakute iindane

382
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:44,220
The scribbling someone made...

383
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:44,220
Dareka ga kaitetta

384
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:50,020
On the wall, of a flower is swaying.

385
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:50,020
Kabe no rakugaki no hana ga yureru

386
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:55,600
No one knows their true selves.

387
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:55,600
Jibunrashisa nante dermo wakaranaiyo

388
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,900
Even though we both lose and gain

389
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,900
Nagai nagai michi no tochuu de

390
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,320
By embarking on this long, long path,

391
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,320
Nakushitari hirottari

392
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:08,990
Kyuu ni samishikunatte naichau hi mo arukedo

393
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:08,990
And though there may be days loneliness strikes and makes us weep...

394
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:16,500
Let's transform our tears and pains to stars.

395
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:16,500
Namida mo itami mo hoshi ni kaeyou

396
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Let's light a candle to illuminate our tomorrow.

397
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Ashita wo terasu akari wo tomosou

398
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:27,630
And we'll hold our small hands over the fire to create stardust,

399
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:27,630
Chiisana te kazashite futari de tsukurou

400
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:32,850
And an eternity that shines so brilliantly.

401
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:32,850
Hoshikuzu wo tsuyoku hikaru eien wo

402
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:38,230
Farewells may be unavoidable,

403
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:38,230
Sayonara itsuka wa kurukamoshirenai

404
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:44,150
Yet the seasons continue to change obliviously.

405
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:44,150
Kisetsu wa soredemo meguri megutteku

406
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,240
Even if I lose myself, I'll continue to walk...

407
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,240
Chiisaku mayottemo aruiteku

408
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,280
Walk by your side.

409
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,280
Kimi to aruiteku

410
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,580
That's the only thing I'd like to never change.

411
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,580
Sore dake wa kawaranaideiyoune

412
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,890
The whole truth lies in Xerxes.

413
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:07,900
The residents left in the city that rusted away and disappeared...

414
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,860
...wipe away the darkness within the boy.

415
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:15,990
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

416
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:22,000
The Arrogant Palm
of a Small Human

417
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:22,000
Episode 18, The Arrogant Palm of a Small Human.

418
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,080
Humans, raise the signal of counterattack.
