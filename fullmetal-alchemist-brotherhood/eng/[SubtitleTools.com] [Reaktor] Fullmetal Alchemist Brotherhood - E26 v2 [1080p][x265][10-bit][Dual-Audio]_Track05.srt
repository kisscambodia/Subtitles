1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:06,190
Drawn by a landscape as white as snow,

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:06,190
Masshiro na keshiki ni ima sasowarete

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,740
I'm headed toward an unseen world.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,740
Boku wa yuku yo mada minu sekai e

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,680
I've been traveling while lost

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,680
Maigo no mama tabi shiteita

7
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,470
Under this gray sky.

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,460
Nezumiiro no sora no shita

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,560
Every day with new maps, stained with my many dreams.

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,560
Higawari no chizu ikutsumo no yume ga nijindeita

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,950
Itsuka wa sa

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,950
I wonder if someday,

13
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,990
Even with these tiny steps of mine,

14
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,990
Chippoke na boku no kono hohaba demo

15
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:43,070
I'll be able to travel beyond those clouds.

16
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:43,070
Ano kumo no mukou made yukeru kana

17
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,700
I put on a bold front.

18
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,700
Tsuyogatte

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,250
End up hurting myself.

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,250
Kizutsuita

21
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,330
I feel empty inside.

22
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,330
Kokoro sukashita youni

23
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,870
It's started to rain,

24
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,870
Furidashita

25
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,040
And the raindrops

26
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,040
Amatsubu tachi ga

27
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,260
Began to repeat their scattered reflections.

28
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,260
Ranhansha kurikaesu

29
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,130
These straight rays of light

30
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,130
Massugu na hikari ga

31
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,850
Start to cross one another.

32
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,850
Kousa shite

33
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,430
Yakusaki mo tsugenumama

34
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,430
And without telling anyone where they're headed,

35
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,720
Across the endless distances,

36
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,720
Doko made mo

37
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,310
They pass through all matter.

38
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,310
Tsukinukeru

39
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:14,140
I burn these faint afterimages onto my eyes.

40
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:14,140
Awai zanzou ryoume ni yakitsukete

41
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,060
Under this sky,

42
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,060
Kono sora no shita

43
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,890
Wherever I am,

44
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,890
Donna toko ni itemo

45
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,190
I should be able to reach

46
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,190
Todoku hazu nanda

47
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:27,000
The unseen world.

48
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:27,000
Mada minu sekai e

49
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:45,990
Ed!

50
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,990
You little shit!

51
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,410
Lin!

52
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,710
You bastard!

53
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,500
Kill... me...

54
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,130
Save me...

55
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,510
Please... kill me!

56
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,760
Please...

57
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,100
I want to die...

58
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,730
Mommy!

59
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,080
What are you just staring out into space for, idiot?!

60
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,040
Why are you hesitating?!

61
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,910
There are...

62
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,830
There are people inside of him...

63
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,050
They want our help.

64
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,340
No! They're monsters!

65
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,050
But...

66
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,090
Pull yourself together!

67
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,590
They're monsters!

68
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,260
Kill me!

69
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,390
Mommy!

70
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,930
Please! Give me back my child!

71
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,560
Shut up! Stop it!

72
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,640
Dad!

73
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,690
It hurts...

74
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,560
Help me!

75
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,730
I said, "Stop it!"

76
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,570
Ed.

77
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,240
Let's play.

78
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,030
Let's play.

79
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,700
Playtime's over.

80
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,550
Damn...

81
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,640
...it...

82
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,850
Help me...

83
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,810
You don't understand the pain...

84
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,320
Ed! Wake up!

85
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,320
Come to your senses!

86
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,860
Join us!

87
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,780
Ed!

88
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,030
Ed!

89
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,690
Reunion

90
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,540
Good! Good!

91
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,130
All right, bring it over this way!

92
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,880
Oh yeah.

93
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,590
I saw it over by the waste plant earlier.

94
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,130
If I recall, it was with some huge guy in an armor.

95
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,470
Armor?

96
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,100
Don't tell me it's the one from yesterday!

97
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,650
I'll never forgive him for kidnapping Shao May!

98
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,810
Demon! Devil! Loincloth!

99
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,320
There she is! Shao Ma-

100
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,200
Wait.

101
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,080
That fat one...

102
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,250
If I recall, they called him a Homunculus.

103
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,670
Homunculus?

104
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,340
Their regeneration ability matches that of an immortal.

105
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,210
We can't jump in carelessly.

106
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,800
Immortal?

107
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,470
This is my chance! Let's go after him!

108
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,560
I told you. He's not an easy opponent.

109
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,270
Why are those two together?

110
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,450
What's wrong?

111
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,240
This place... is strange.

112
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,540
I've had a feeling that something was out of place, ever since I arrived in this country, but...

113
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,120
This is...

114
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:28,000
There are things crawling beneath my feet... and a lot of them...

115
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,390
What's wrong? Are you cold?

116
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,520
You okay?

117
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,900
This way.

118
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,410
I never would've thought something like this was under Central...

119
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,170
W-What the heck is this?!

120
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,640
That was done by the gatekeepers.

121
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,050
Gatekeepers?

122
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,890
They won't attack you if you're with me.

123
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,400
There's something up there.

124
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,950
Do we still have a long way to go?

125
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,450
A long way.

126
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,620
We're meeting your father, right?

127
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,200
He knows where people go after you swallow them, right?

128
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,460
Father knows everything.

129
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,540
Brother... You're alive, right?

130
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,590
Brother...

131
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,030
What's that?

132
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,570
A red... stone?

133
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,160
Right, Envy's core.

134
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,160
A philosopher's stone.

135
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,580
After all the time we spent looking for one,
there's one right in front of me...

136
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,100
Let me out, Envy!

137
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,520
It stinks in here!

138
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,520
What?

139
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,020
We may be able to get out of here!

140
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,480
Let's work together, Envy!

141
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,130
What in the world are these?

142
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,090
They are chimera.

143
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,990
There's no end to them.

144
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,910
No...

145
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,080
As I thought... there's something beneath us...

146
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,500
Are they chimera?

147
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,710
No.

148
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,670
Is this... a person?!

149
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,760
Father made us all!

150
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,100
Me, Lust, and Envy!

151
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,950
It's loud up there.

152
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,950
Someone's coming...

153
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:39,710
I don't remember my parents' names, their faces, or even my own name.

154
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:44,550
No... I don't remember if I was abandoned or sold before I had even been given a name.

155
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,930
Which one of you will lead this country?

156
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,190
Will it be you?

157
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:58,690
We were called the "Führer President Candidates".

158
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,700
And we were all gathered into one place and educated in many different fields.

159
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,530
How to be a good emperor, anthropology...

160
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:12,080
We were trained in military combat, marksmanship, and swordsmanship until we were highly capable.

161
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,600
Don't sweat it.

162
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,810
He was just a pawn for you to achieve your goal.

163
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,060
"I will lead this country someday."

164
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,320
With that thought in mind,
I endured the toughest of trainings.

165
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,120
He was no good either.

166
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,370
Next.

167
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,500
Lie down here.

168
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,630
Umm... What is this about?

169
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,840
Relax.

170
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,140
It'll be over soon.

171
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,890
What are you planning to do?! Those bodies are...

172
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,480
This is the twelfth one, huh?

173
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,610
Are you the one...

174
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,280
...who will receive my wrath?

175
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:39,250
A philosopher's stone is a high energy substance that includes the souls of many humans.

176
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:45,090
As it enters a human's body, it goes on a rampage and tries to take over.

177
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:56,890
The destruction and reconstruction by the stone is repeated until either the body dies or wins.

178
00:11:58,730 --> 00:11:59,980
Eventually...

179
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,770
Amazing!

180
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,610
A new species of life!

181
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,730
Congratulations.

182
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:08,950
You've been selected to be the man who will lead this country.

183
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:12,240
He will prepare everything you may need.

184
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,620
From this day on, your name shall be...

185
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,450
King Bradley!

186
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:26,420
All that was left was a soul and the emotion of wrath.

187
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:35,600
I don't even know if this soul belongs to someone who was turned into the stone, or if it was mine to begin with.

188
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:49,070
If you were human, couldn't you live as a human instead of a Homunculus, sir?

189
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
You're telling me to go back to being a human?

190
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,570
That's impossible.

191
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:58,080
This body has far surpassed human capabilities.

192
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,790
It's far superior.

193
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:10,090
Just as how you humans are proud to be human,
we are proud to be Homunculi.

194
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,300
I'm sure that woman took that pride to her death, as well.

195
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,350
Ow.

196
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,180
Just something temporary.

197
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,520
Thanks.

198
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,610
I've collected all the ones around here.

199
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,610
Are these all from Xerxes?

200
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,990
Yeah.

201
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,160
It's a portion of the mural that was in a temple in the ruins.

202
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:40,040
When I first saw it,

203
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:45,630
I thought it was a transmutation circle for a philosopher's stone, like the one beneath Research Laboratory 5.

204
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,960
But I was wrong.

205
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,630
The sun represents the soul.

206
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,880
The moon represents the mind.

207
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:56,890
And this stone which has the mural on it. This represents the body.

208
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:00,930
Come on... explain it so I can understand.

209
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,890
Basically, what was drawn there...

210
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,150
...is a circle for human transmutation.

211
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,730
Human transmutation?

212
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,900
So that means, to raise the dead...

213
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:11,900
No.

214
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:15,610
The principle of alchemy is equivalent exchange.

215
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:20,080
One cannot create a soul that doesn't exist in this world, at least through alchemy.

216
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,910
I've confirmed that.

217
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,170
So, I've thought of a way to get out of here.

218
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,340
What if I transmute myself from scratch...

219
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,550
A human that's alive?

220
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,800
Transmute from scratch?

221
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,800
Yeah.

222
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:41,770
I use this transmutation circle to decompose myself, then put myself back together.

223
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,560
That's also human transmutation.

224
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,060
The gate should open.

225
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,060
If Gluttony is a fake Gate of Truth,

226
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:53,820
shouldn't we be able to get to
the real world by going through the real gate?

227
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,320
I'll open the gate; you guys leap in.

228
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,330
What if this doesn't work?

229
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,370
Then we suffer from rebound.

230
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:06,960
All of the effects of the rebound go to the one who attempted it.

231
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,960
In this case, me.

232
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,500
I know nothing about alchemy.

233
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,090
I'll leave it to you.

234
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,090
All right.

235
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,720
So, Envy, there's something I need to ask you.

236
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,270
The mural I saw at Xerxes looked like this.

237
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,770
I'm curious about this symbol.

238
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,940
It's the word representing God, but flipped over.

239
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,320
And the dragon with two heads.

240
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,660
This represents the perfect being.

241
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:47,290
This means "I will cast God from the Heavens to the Earth, and become the perfect being."

242
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:50,080
People think of outrageous things.

243
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,000
It would be wonderful if they had only thought about it.

244
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,670
The problem here is...

245
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,670
...this part, which is broken off.

246
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:00,550
A lion that swallows the sun.

247
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,800
This represents the philosopher's stone.

248
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,640
And the ingredients of philosopher's stones are live humans.

249
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,640
Right, Envy?

250
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,600
Yeah, you're right.

251
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:16,230
Why did the nation of Xerxes,
a nation so prosperous, perish overnight?

252
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,780
Where did its citizens go?

253
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:22,910
Isn't a portion of the ruins in here to cover up the evidence?

254
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,000
You guys turned all of Xerxes' citizens into a philosopher's stone, didn't you?!

255
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,560
Who did it?!

256
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,640
Who transmuted themselves?!

257
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,270
Who's the one who turned all of the country's people into a philosopher's stone for tremendous power...

258
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:56,570
...for the sole purpose of becoming a being that would surpass God?!

259
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,820
Is it the "Father" that you talked about?

260
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:07,330
Isn't that guy trying to recreate that event in this country by using you guys, the Homunculi?!

261
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,580
I'll tell you if you get us out of here.

262
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:17,500
Let's stop beating around the bush, Fullmetal Alchemist.

263
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,220
You need a toll if you're going to open the gate, right?

264
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,850
Use it.

265
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,810
Help me!

266
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,890
Please, just kill me!

267
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,360
These are all people from Xerxes, aren't they?

268
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:43,360
Their bodies and minds have rotted away in the ancient past, and they are beings who are solely used as an energy source.

269
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,030
They don't even remember what they used to look like.

270
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,160
Are you sympathizing with them?

271
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,870
What a stupid emotion.

272
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:57,500
The sole reason you want to think of them as humans is that you want to believe that your brother, who's only a soul, is human, too.

273
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:04,680
You hesitate to set fire to coal because you feel sorry for a tree that died ages ago?

274
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,260
They can't return to being human anymore.

275
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:13,600
Lay down a definition for a human with logic and not emotion, alchemist.

276
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,530
All right.

277
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:28,780
Lin, if something happens to me,
tell everyone about what these guys are up to.

278
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,830
Whatever happens to Amestris isn't my problem.

279
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,420
Hey!

280
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,920
There are people precious to you waiting for you in that country, right?

281
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,130
Get out of here alive and tell them yourself.

282
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:52,810
I'm sorry. Please let me use your souls.

283
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:57,940
Let's do this!

284
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,030
I thought that pose of putting their hands together looked similar to something...

285
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,530
It's almost like a prayer to God.

286
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,550
It's been a while since I've done this.

287
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,970
I never thought I'd open it again... under this situation.

288
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,550
Lin! Jump in!

289
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,560
I'm counting on you, alchemist!

290
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,440
This is the same sensation I felt while being swallowed by Gluttony...

291
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,490
Thank you...

292
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,870
Thank you...

293
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,630
The body and the soul are connected by the mind.

294
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:13,760
A part of my body is before the Gate of Truth.

295
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:19,020
If I just let my mind guide me,
I should be able to get to the gate...

296
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:25,150
Oh, so you didn't come here to get your body back?

297
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,990
Your father is through here, right?

298
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,200
Yeah.

299
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,620
I can find clues on how to find my brother...

300
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,840
All right, I'm here.

301
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:59,270
Why are there two gates?

302
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,630
Al!

303
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,840
Al! Come here!

304
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,880
Hurry up! Al!!!

305
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,260
Al!!!

306
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,640
I can't.

307
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,390
You're not my soul.

308
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,640
I can't go with you.

309
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,000
Alphonse!

310
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,840
Alphonse!

311
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,300
Alphonse!

312
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,680
Someday, I'll come and bring you back.

313
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,680
Wait for me.

314
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,480
Wait for me!!!

315
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:37,340
I don't have to act tough, right?

316
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:37,340
Tsuyogaranakute iindane

317
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:44,140
The scribbling someone made...

318
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:44,140
Dareka ga kaitetta

319
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:49,940
Kabe no rakugaki no hana ga yureru

320
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:49,940
On the wall, of a flower is swaying.

321
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:55,520
No one knows their true selves.

322
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:55,520
Jibunrashisa nante dermo wakaranaiyo

323
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,820
Even though we both lose and gain

324
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,820
Nagai nagai michi no tochuu de

325
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:01,240
By embarking on this long, long path,

326
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:01,240
Nakushitari hirottari

327
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:08,910
And though there may be days loneliness strikes and makes us weep...

328
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:08,910
Kyuu ni samishikunatte naichau hi mo arukedo

329
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,420
Let's transform our tears and pains to stars.

330
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,420
Namida mo itami mo hoshi ni kaeyou

331
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:22,420
Let's light a candle to illuminate our tomorrow.

332
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:22,420
Ashita wo terasu akari wo tomosou

333
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:27,550
And we'll hold our small hands over the fire to create stardust,

334
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:27,550
Chiisana te kazashite futari de tsukurou

335
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:32,770
And an eternity that shines so brilliantly.

336
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:32,770
Hoshikuzu wo tsuyoku hikaru eien wo

337
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:38,150
Farewells may be unavoidable,

338
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:38,150
Sayonara itsuka wa kurukamoshirenai

339
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:44,070
Yet the seasons continue to change obliviously.

340
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:44,070
Kisetsu wa soredemo meguri megutteku

341
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,160
Chiisaku mayottemo aruiteku

342
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,160
Even if I lose myself, I'll continue to walk...

343
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,200
Walk by your side.

344
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,200
Kimi to aruiteku

345
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,500
That's the only thing I'd like to never change.

346
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,500
Sore dake wa kawaranaideiyoune

347
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:05,480
It is hard to find the shape of an illusion, like a wavering flame.

348
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:11,320
And a flame can be cruel at times, but can also be a flame of hope.

349
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:17,360
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

350
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:21,120
Interlude Party

351
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:21,120
Episode 27, Interlude Party.

352
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:25,790
You mustn't be afraid of the darkness inside of you.
