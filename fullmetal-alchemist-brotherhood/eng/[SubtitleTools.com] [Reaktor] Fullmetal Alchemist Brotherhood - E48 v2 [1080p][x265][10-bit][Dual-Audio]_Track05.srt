1
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:23,460
We sigh whenever we're about to come to a standstill

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:23,460
Owarinaki tabi no tochuu tachidomarisouna toki

3
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,710
While moving on this endless journey.

4
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,710
Fukai tameiki kobosu bokura wa

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,430
Everytime we lunge for it, it escapes and flies off.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,430
Tsukamikaketewa mata hanareteitta

7
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,850
But now, there's nothing to be afraid of

8
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,850
Demo ima wa mou nanimo osoreru koto wa nai

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,780
Kokoro wo tsunagu tsuyoi kizuna wa

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,780
The powerful ties that bind our hearts

11
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,240
Will never come loose.

12
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,240
Keshite hodoke wa shinai sa

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,960
After a lifetime of searching, we finally arrived

14
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,960
Sagashitsuzukete tadoritsuita

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,760
Here, where the period lies.

16
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,760
Kono basho de piriodo ni

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:23,060
Let's change all our sorrow and rage to power.

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:23,060
Kanashimi ikari chikara ni kaete

19
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,980
Unmei wa sugu soba ni

20
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,980
Destiny is right within our reach.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Oath in the Tunnel

22
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,040
Geez, I've died...

23
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,330
...so many times because of you!

24
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,970
That was close!

25
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,520
Young master!

26
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,650
Save the reunion for later!

27
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,560
Let's finish this up!

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,360
Roger!

29
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,570
Just let me eat you already!

30
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,620
What a one-sided battle!

31
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,380
I had no idea you were hiding such a fine woman from me.

32
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,420
Quite the playboy, are we?

33
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,250
Thank you kindly!

34
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,090
How in the world can you tell where I am...

35
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,140
...when it's so pitch dark out here?

36
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,420
The Emperor of Xing moves our nation by manipulating the veins of the dragon,

37
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,930
in other words, the flow of energy.

38
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:29,270
We, who serve him, can also read the flow.

39
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,230
Additionally, by virtue of our office, we can see well in the dark.

40
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,360
That voice...

41
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,860
It's been a while, kid.

42
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,660
So it is  you, Old Man Fu!

43
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,910
Why are you here?

44
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,410
How did you know where we were?

45
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,250
We were lurking in Central for a bit to figure out what was going on,

46
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:57,340
and we sensed a few substantial energy forms headed in this direction.

47
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,800
So we followed them.

48
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,300
There are two large energy forms clashing right over there, too.

49
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,840
I think those are Greed and Gluttony.

50
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,180
Greed...!

51
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,060
The one who took over the young master's body?!

52
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,520
There's also one in the woods.

53
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,280
A friend of ours is fighting a homunculus named Pride right now.

54
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,240
Right.

55
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,820
And lastly,

56
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:30,790
there's something within the nearby village that can't even be compared to the rest.

57
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,500
That's probably Ed's old man.

58
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,960
Him?!

59
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,920
Is your father not human?!

60
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,380
We can leave him be for now.

61
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,300
Gotta do something about the homunculi first.

62
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,680
Don't worry about Gluttony.

63
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,970
We can leave him to Lan Fan.

64
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,220
"Leave him to Lan Fan"...?

65
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,770
It's only been half a year since she got her automail attached!

66
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,110
That's reckless, old man!

67
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,480
We need to help her, or she's dead meat!

68
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,040
What the hell?!

69
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,540
Don't worry about her.

70
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,290
Martial arts isn't our only weapon.

71
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,300
If you're gonna blow stuff up, say so first!

72
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,840
What?!

73
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,050
Explosions?!

74
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:27,880
What's going on?

75
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,550
Is it in the forest?

76
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,590
Are lights not back on yet?

77
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,050
Hey, bring a lamp!

78
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,640
Geez...

79
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,730
In that case, I guess I can rest assured.

80
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,530
Old Man Fu, what else do you guys have aside from explosives?

81
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,530
A lot of stuff.

82
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,410
Tear gas, flash bangs, and flares.

83
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,370
The people in the slums are beginning to turn on lights.

84
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,540
Those shadows will start to appear again.

85
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,040
If we don't hurry, Heinkel will be in trouble!

86
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,750
Exactly.

87
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,970
Old Man Fu, could you take me to where Pride is?

88
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,640
There's something I want you to help out with.

89
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,310
Roger that.

90
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,690
Ed!

91
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,440
Don't let your guard down.

92
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,200
Pride, the one that Heinkel's fighting...

93
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,230
Just die already...

94
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,170
It's just as you said, little Roy.

95
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,090
Selim Bradley is not human.

96
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,670
These photographs are quite old.

97
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,970
Twenty years ago...

98
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,180
And this one's from fifty years ago.

99
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,390
No matter what era, he's always near important government officials.

100
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,820
I also checked the town where the Führer President was supposedly born in.

101
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,110
Although there are documents that show he grew up there,

102
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:56,070
not a single soul has seen the Bradley family there before.

103
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,000
The mansion located at the address was also a fake.

104
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,910
Of course, no relatives either.

105
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,630
Thank you, Madam Christmas.

106
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,550
You must have been through a lot to gather all this information.

107
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,920
You bet.

108
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,720
But the moment I found out Selim wasn't human,

109
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,560
all my fatigue just flew away.

110
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,810
But then...

111
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,230
...I wonder why nobody noticed before?

112
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,480
He's the son of the man who stands at the top of this militaristic nation, even nicknamed 'King'.

113
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:35,240
Fabricating a tale is like a walk in the park.

114
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,510
Y-You little...!

115
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,340
Hey!

116
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,720
Who is it?!

117
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,220
Is someone there?!

118
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,840
A monster!

119
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,140
Oh no!

120
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,020
A child is being attacked!

121
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,660
A monster!!

122
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:25,790
Shit!

123
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:32,300
Naturally, with this much light, there's plenty of shadow.

124
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,010
Goodbye, mister chimera.

125
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,970
That was close, man.

126
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,020
Geez...

127
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,900
I still can't believe a brat like you was a homunculus.

128
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,360
You certainly had me going, Selim Bradley.

129
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,820
Appearances are only symbols.

130
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:58,530
Isn't that right,

131
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,660
mister tiny alchemist?

132
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,300
Where is he?!

133
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,130
Where's Roy Mustang?!

134
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,090
He's still inside.

135
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,510
Been in there for a while,
considering how he goes there so often.

136
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,180
That woman, Madam Christmas...

137
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,770
Her real name is Chris Mustang.

138
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,310
His foster mother!

139
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:30,690
Dammit!

140
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,200
Christ...

141
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,120
Look what happened to my castle...

142
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,500
I'll buy another one for you soon, so forgive me.

143
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,830
In that case, I guess I can let it go.

144
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,460
I'm going to need to stay undercover for a while, too.

145
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,630
Are the girls from the shop safe?

146
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:01,510
Don't worry, they should be in a foreign country by now.

147
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,310
They're probably having fun,
and I'm sure they've forgotten about you.

148
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,390
Moving right along...

149
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,150
Worry about yourself and this country's future for now.

150
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:27,040
I won't forgive you if I meet you in a body bag as a traitor the next time I see you.

151
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,500
Thanks, Madam.

152
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,660
I'll definitely repay you.

153
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,330
Gonna repay the loan once you become successful, eh?

154
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:38,710
I guess I'll be looking forward to it this time, little Roy.

155
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,680
I'm not a kid anymore, you know...

156
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,270
Okay.

157
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,770
Guess it's time for me to do my job too.

158
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,170
You're late, Colonel.

159
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,420
We were about to leave without you.

160
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,430
Your jabs make me feel right at home.

161
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,720
No signs of being followed?

162
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,680
Nope.

163
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,520
If there were, he'd react to them right away.

164
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,520
That's a good boy.

165
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,150
I'm counting on you!

166
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,820
Any movements from the Bradley family?

167
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,240
I've confirmed their plans for the next three days.

168
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,410
The Führer President is attending the joint practice in the east.

169
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,030
Selim is also with him.

170
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,330
About that...

171
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,790
The train that was carrying the Führer President plummeted down a valley.

172
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,710
Wow...

173
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:01,920
That old Grumman really knows how to be extreme.

174
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,920
With that, they'll start being a lot more cautious...

175
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,300
That may make some things difficult for us.

176
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,350
Will that affect our mission?

177
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,640
Will the Eastern Army come to Central as planned?

178
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,690
The Führer President is missing...

179
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,820
The chance of a lifetime, or a trap to lure us in...

180
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,580
Even if it happens to be the latter, we have no choice but to proceed.

181
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,210
Please give us an order.

182
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:48,510
What's in our hands right now is a one-way ticket to a battlefield.

183
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,470
No matter the outcome, we can't go back.

184
00:13:54,430 --> 00:14:00,150
The reason for that is because even after we complete our mission,

185
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:05,320
you all have the grand task of rebuilding the nation by my side, after I become Führer President.

186
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:10,070
With that said, my only order for you all is this:

187
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,870
"Don't die!"

188
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,080
That is all!

189
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,210
Roger!

190
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,140
Why...

191
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,430
Why won't it slice?

192
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,830
Good thing I left my automail in its northern state.

193
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,840
There's plenty of carbon fiber in it, after all.

194
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,050
Carbon reinforcement!

195
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,180
Copying Greed, eh?

196
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,050
In that case...

197
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:31,900
What's wrong?

198
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,450
Are you finished already?!

199
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,290
As originally planned...

200
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,720
Al!

201
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:56,600
...it's probably advantageous for me to fight using your little brother.

202
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,520
Old Man Fu!

203
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,780
A flash bang?!

204
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,530
Curses!

205
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,910
I'm sick of those guys!

206
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,490
Huh?

207
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,510
What's wrong, Lan Fan?!

208
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,510
Lan Fan!

209
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,310
Donkey Kong!

210
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:41,560
You got it!

211
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:49,690
Al!

212
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,490
Donkey Kong, you take Al and run.

213
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,280
Isn't he still under Pride's influence?

214
00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:00,160
Parts that have been separated from
a homunculi's body disperse and cease to exist.

215
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,500
Since we separated Al from the source
of the shadow, Pride is no longer inside him.

216
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,710
I won't let you get away!

217
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,880
Have another one!

218
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,970
Hey, what was that flash from earlier?

219
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,850
Ow! Ow!

220
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,560
You're good.

221
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,820
You look pretty beat up.

222
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:38,030
That woman and Greed are so strange!

223
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:41,450
It's like they know where I am in the dark!

224
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,620
What did you say?

225
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,170
They must be the warriors from Xing that Wrath was talking about.

226
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,250
The ones that can feel the presence of us homunculi.

227
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:59,510
Greed must be using that ability after absorbing Xing's prince.

228
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,140
Damn him...

229
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,020
Gluttony,

230
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,190
how many times did you die?

231
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,280
I don't even know.

232
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,360
A lot.

233
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,110
I was beaten pretty badly as well.

234
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,660
At this rate, we may end up being annihilated by them.

235
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:29,040
Then we can have Father fix us up-

236
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,500
Huh?

237
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,080
What?

238
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:36,960
No...

239
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,680
I don't like this, Pride.

240
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,400
No!

241
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,650
Don't eat me!

242
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,820
That hurts...

243
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,660
Help me... Lust...

244
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,260
He... ate his own comrade...!

245
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,270
Wow.

246
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,890
This is convenient.

247
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,060
It's quite simple to distinguish your scents.

248
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,610
Although the hunger that came with the ability seems like it'll be a pain.

249
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:40,990
Huh?

250
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,620
This scent...

251
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,620
Are you nearby,

252
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,210
Hohenheim?

253
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:14,230
The promise we never made

254
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:14,230
Kawashita hazu no nai yakasoku ga

255
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,020
yet again

256
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,020
Kyou mo

257
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:19,860
tries to snatch our future away from us.

258
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:19,860
Bokura no mirai wo ubaou to suru

259
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:25,450
Why is it that we can't rejoice

260
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:25,450
Hoshigatteita mono wo te ni shitemo

261
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:26,450
Sunao ni

262
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:26,450
straight from the heart

263
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:31,410
when we obtain something we've always been after?

264
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:31,410
Umaku waraenai nowa nazedarou

265
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,130
The overflowing tears aren't from feebleness or remorse.

266
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,130
Afureru namida wo yowasa ya koukai ja nai

267
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:41,920
They're fragments born from agony.

268
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:41,920
Itami ga unda kakera de

269
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,970
Of all the moments and destinies,

270
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,970
Donna shunkan datte unmei datte

271
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:55,730
I realized there's one absolute certainty.

272
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:55,730
Hitotsu dake tashika na mono ga aru to shitta

273
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:58,270
Even if things get tough and I'm at my limit

274
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:58,270
Genkai datte konnan datte

275
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:02,280
I refuse to give up.

276
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:02,280
Akirametakunaiyo

277
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,160
Please, don't let go.

278
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,160
Konomama hanasanaide

279
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:15,000
I can feel the warmth of your right hand

280
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:15,000
Kataku nigirishimeta kimi no migite no nukumori

281
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,670
where it's tightly joined with my left.

282
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,670
Koko ni arukara

283
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:34,020
It appears as though Mustang is sneaking about with his old underlings.

284
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:43,820
If he has something to do with the train explosion and all the Ishbalans that have infiltrated Central...

285
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,030
Just when I thought things couldn't get any worse...

286
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:56,660
You all must know his thoughts better than myself.

287
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,040
If you were him, what would you do next?

288
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:12,810
If it were me, I'd get Madam Bradley in my hands first.

289
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,980
Take her hostage?

290
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,810
What a useless act.

291
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,530
Intentionally making himself seem like a traitor by taking a useless hostage, eh...

292
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,820
Humans are so incorrigible.

293
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:56,470
Hey, what are you doing?!

294
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,810
Roy Mustang?!

295
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,170
Sorry for causing trouble this late at night, Madam.

296
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,090
Lieutenant Hawkeye!

297
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,130
Why would someone like you do this?!

298
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,380
Pardon my rudeness.

299
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:35,470
We have no intention of harming you if you don't resist.

300
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,440
Please, come with us.

301
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,160
Memories.

302
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,000
They are recollections of the heart.

303
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,290
If those who are not human come to possess memories,

304
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,960
people begin to fear the result.

305
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:15,930
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

306
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:19,950
Episode 49, Filial Affection.

307
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,950
Filial Affection

308
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:25,190
With each of their own thoughts in their chest, they see the daybreak.
