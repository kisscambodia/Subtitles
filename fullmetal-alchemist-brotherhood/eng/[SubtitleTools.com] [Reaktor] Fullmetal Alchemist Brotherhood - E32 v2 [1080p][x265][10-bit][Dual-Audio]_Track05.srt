1
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,870
Can't focus. My body is still puzzled about what to do.

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,870
Shuuchuu dekitenaina mada karada ga mayotteirunda

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,630
I'm trembling. I can't stop even if I try to control myself.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,630
Furueteitanja kontoroorushitatte burerunda

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,380
Although neither sun nor moon are on my side,

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,380
Taiyou mo tsuki mo nanmo kanzen ni kocchi muiteinaiga

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,800
"I've no choice but to try,"

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,800
Yarushikanainda

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,470
Those were the words I muttered to myself.

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,470
Iikikaseruyouni sotto tsubuyaita

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,060
Joukyou wa waruiga tada nigedasunja konjou nainaa

12
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,060
The odds aren't on my side, but running way'd be gutless.

13
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,060
Even if I can't see the future, I'll just have to win it over with courage.

14
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,060
Tenbou wa naiga dokyou de kuria suru shika naiya

15
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,560
Need to keep distance from the target as I hold myself back.

16
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,560
Shoudou wa osaetamama taagetto to no kankaku sagure

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,860
All that's needed for victory is pride to win.

18
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,860
Hitsuyou na mon wa katsu puraido

19
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,950
Will we celebrate with the wine of victory

20
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,950
Ajiwau nowa shouri no bishu ka

21
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,950
Or'll we end up kissing their feet in defeat?

22
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,950
Soretomo haiboku no kujuu ka

23
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,700
There are two outcomes to everything.

24
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,700
Sou subete wa futatsu ni hitotsu

25
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,420
I want to control destiny.

26
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,420
Ayatsuritai unmei no ito

27
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,750
I need to seize the golden opportunity with my hands.

28
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,750
Zekkou no goorudentaimu kono te de tsukame

29
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,840
I'll finish it up with my best poker face,

30
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,840
Konshin no pookaafeisu kimete shikakeruyo

31
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,800
And drag them into a world of illusions.

32
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,800
Iryuujon no sekai e hikizurikonde

33
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,140
I'll find my way out of this endless pressure game,

34
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,140
Saigennai puresshaageemu sururito nukete

35
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,150
And leap over the borderline of honor.

36
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,150
Eikou no boodaarain tobikoeru tameni

37
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,860
How many? What'll I need to sacrifice to make it happen?

38
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,860
Haumenii? Dorekurai no daishou ga iru?

39
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,120
What is the one thing I don't want to let go?

40
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,120
Tebanashitakunai mon wa dore?

41
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,310
Well...

42
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,480
It really does look like the drawing, but...

43
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,330
Isn't she just the cutest thing?

44
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,330
That's definitely not it!

45
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,540
I know that!

46
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,830
We really don't have time for these jokes!

47
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,630
Really...

48
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,800
Where could she be?

49
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,080
The Führer's Son

50
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,060
East City!

51
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,730
You've arrived in East City!

52
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,120
Here's the latest news on Scar.

53
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,910
He's still on the run?

54
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,040
What a persistent guy.

55
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,790
Oh my, I'm terribly sorry.

56
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,510
No, it's my fault for not paying attention.

57
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,090
You are wearing some unusual attire.

58
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,050
Are you not from this country?

59
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,970
I'm from Xing.

60
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,220
Oh, my.

61
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,310
Are you here to see the sights?

62
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,890
There's not much to see in East City, is there?

63
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,020
No, I just stopped by because I need to switch trains here.

64
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,770
I'm headed to the North.

65
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:02,650
The train at Platform No. 3 is headed for North City.

66
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,440
Oh, no!

67
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,360
Thank you for helping me pick up the groceries!

68
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,070
If you are planning on riding with us, please board at once.

69
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,070
Have a safe trip!

70
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,700
Hm?

71
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,710
What a peculiar kitty.

72
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,440
Where did he go?!

73
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,030
I know I heard footsteps...

74
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,830
There he is!

75
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,640
So he was with a middle-aged man with black hair?

76
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,310
Yes. According to the reports, sir.

77
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,860
This is where he was yesterday.

78
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,110
So he's headed West, huh?

79
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,410
We have a few injured, some slightly, others seriously.

80
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,620
Scar must be desperate, too.

81
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,000
But even so...

82
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,000
...he's attracting a lot of attention.

83
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,420
Now, let's head off to work.

84
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,700
Well, whatever.

85
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,620
That has nothing to do with me.

86
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,640
A funeral, eh?

87
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,150
Yes, it seems so.

88
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,780
It isn't pretty, is it?

89
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:52,700
When you get old like me, you can't help but think about when you'll be the one getting buried.

90
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,660
What a terrible thing to say, madam.

91
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,410
As far as I can see, you have a long life ahead of you.

92
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,130
Lieutenant General Grumman?!

93
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:13,010
You said we were going to meet in front of Brigadier General Hughes' grave, right?

94
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:19,770
I figured it was something serious since you decided to take the measure of last resort.

95
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,400
To be doubly sure, I decided to disguise myself.

96
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,190
Well, I shouldn't have expected less from you, a man so famous for his eccentricity.

97
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,730
Your disguise exceeded my expectations.

98
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,320
Eccentric?

99
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,820
I'll take that as a compliment.

100
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,740
So, what's the matter?

101
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,750
Eastern Alchemy.

102
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,290
We may be able to find something in the Central Library.

103
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,500
Maybe.

104
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,420
Since we can't find the midget,
we'll have to search on our own.

105
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,260
I hope we can at least find some clues.

106
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,510
I see. So the entire upper echelon of Central is guilty, huh?

107
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:03,520
But you lost far too much in exchange for the information.

108
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:08,520
You have nothing left if they take away the men you can trust.

109
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,610
You're right, sir. I can't argue with that.

110
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,360
Even Raven, huh...

111
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:22,910
When I was in Central a little while ago, Raven asked me...

112
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:28,290
"Are you interested in a perfect, immortal army?"

113
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,300
Immortal army?

114
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,220
Was he talking about the Homunculi?

115
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,300
I flat-out rejected him, saying that it was rubbish.

116
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,970
Then soon after,

117
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,390
I was sent to Eastern Headquarters.

118
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,400
Relegated?

119
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:52,820
Thanks to that, I'm now stuck cleaning up after all the messes in the East.

120
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,280
More on that topic, do you happen to remember the riot in Lior?

121
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:05,160
The case where the Fullmetal Alchemist exposed the fake priest of Leto's conspiracy.

122
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,790
Yes, I do remember.

123
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,130
Although Lior was thrown into disarray,

124
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:19,340
the riot was quickly suppressed thanks to the
Eastern Army's rapid response while it was still minor.

125
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:25,930
But the Central Army intruded on the scene, and the Eastern Army was withdrawn.

126
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,850
Am I right?

127
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,060
Yes.

128
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:36,650
Lior's public order suddenly turned for
the worse when the Central Army entered the scene.

129
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:41,740
Those guys at Central are really
planning something, aren't they?

130
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,120
I don't even want to think about it!

131
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,750
Can't things be peaceful until I retire?

132
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,000
Again with the jokes.

133
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,170
You're the great Lieutenant General Grumman.

134
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:57,420
I'm sure you haven't felt satisfied for a second at simply being the head man for a region of the country.

135
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:03,890
You have the Eastern Army on your side;
full of veteran soldiers who experienced Ishbal.

136
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:14,650
I had always thought you'd use that secret contact memo when you needed to whine and beg me for help.

137
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,400
But you called me here to get me worked up, huh?

138
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,490
Geez...

139
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:24,700
Now that things are getting interesting in Central,

140
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:30,170
the flame of ambition in my heart has been lit once more.

141
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,170
Don't get too serious or your makeup will be ruined, madam.

142
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,750
Oh, no!

143
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,800
Are you free after this?

144
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,640
If you don't mind, would you like to join me for a cup of tea?

145
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,680
Oh, no, thank you.

146
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,810
I appreciate the invitation, but...

147
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,820
It's no good.

148
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:07,370
Why doesn't this place have any good books on Eastern Alchemy?

149
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,170
Maybe I'll just visit Xing and study there instead...

150
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,000
Wait, but there's no way I'll be able to cross that desert with my automail...

151
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,560
There you are, Edward Elric.

152
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:35,150
M-Major! What are you doing here?!

153
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:35,860
Shh!

154
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,400
You have to be quiet in the library.

155
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:45,620
I heard you're after a girl from Xing
who carries around a black and white cat.

156
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,780
Yeah.

157
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,370
Wait, how did you know that?

158
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,330
I heard from Colonel Mustang.

159
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:54,120
I'm here today on the Colonel's orders.

160
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,750
Apparently, she's headed north.

161
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:03,630
According to a witness, she was in
East City and was headed north from there.

162
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,890
North, huh?

163
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,010
Okay. If we know that much, it's safe to give it a try.

164
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,100
Thanks a lot, Major.

165
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,140
Tell the Colonel I said thanks, too.

166
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,270
Hang on.

167
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,270
Don't be in such a rush.

168
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,270
Take this with you.

169
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,940
What's this?

170
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,740
It's a letter of introduction.

171
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,200
It may not do you much good,

172
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,200
but you should meet her first.

173
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,330
Meet who?

174
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,660
She resides even farther north than the Northern Headquarters.

175
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:40,380
A general who guards the Drakma border and holds another name, the "Northern Wall of Briggs"...

176
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,670
...Major General Armstrong.

177
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,740
Hurry!

178
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,780
You've got nowhere to run, Scar!

179
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:35,480
Where did he go?!

180
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,860
Report this to Headquarters!

181
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,110
That train is headed for West City!

182
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:45,820
Damn him...

183
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:52,660
I can't really find much on Eastern Alchemy...

184
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,790
May's long-distance transmutation was awesome.

185
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,040
I wish I could use that...

186
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,010
I should have asked her about it when she was still at Dr. Nox's place.

187
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:10,010
Ling said that it's used predominantly for medical purposes...

188
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:20,060
Are you the Fullmetal Alchemist's little brother who wears a giant suit wherever he goes?

189
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,310
Y-Yes...

190
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,940
Amazing!

191
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,940
Wow! Wow!

192
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,940
Thanks...

193
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,490
But you need to keep it down. We're in a library.

194
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,950
Oh, I'm sorry.

195
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,080
What are you studying?

196
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,040
Eastern Alchemy.

197
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,040
Eastern Alchemy?

198
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,210
It's a form of alchemy used in Xing.

199
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,090
Wow... Xing, huh?

200
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:53,640
But aren't you Elric Brothers skilled enough to be state qualified in Amestris, a nation so advanced in alchemy?

201
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,600
Why are you researching minor forms of alchemy used in other countries?

202
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,140
Huh?

203
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:07,730
I can't exactly say, "I'm looking for a way to get my body back and fight Homunculi"...

204
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,530
Umm...

205
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,530
They say that Eastern Alchemy is used predominantly for medical purposes.

206
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:20,330
I'm researching to see if there are any other ways human lives could be saved.

207
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,630
Wow! Nothing less to be expected from the Elric Brothers!

208
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,170
Al! Alphonse!

209
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,550
Get your things together! We're leaving!

210
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,720
Brother, you have to keep it down in the library!

211
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,050
Wait, where are we going?

212
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:36,010
I'll explain the details on the way.

213
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,430
Either way, we need to go.

214
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,220
Go to the hotel and pack.

215
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,180
Whose brat is this?

216
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:48,020
If you're his brother, it must mean you're Edward, the State Alchemist!

217
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,570
Yeah.

218
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:49,860
Wow!

219
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,320
So the rumors were true! You really are a tiny alchemist!

220
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,450
What?!

221
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,870
H-Hey...

222
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,620
Say that again...

223
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,370
Come on, say it again.

224
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,540
You're up for a ride.

225
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,870
Want me to blast you to Neptune?

226
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,040
Wow!

227
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,960
So they were right! You get really angry when people say you're short!

228
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,720
Back away from Sir Selim!

229
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,930
You can't shoot him!

230
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:19,930
Don't tell me... you're Selim Bradley?

231
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,180
The Führer President's son?!

232
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,810
Yup! That's right!

233
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,610
What the heck are we doing here?

234
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,870
Aren't we supposed to be headed north?

235
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,030
Not like it was my choice...

236
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,790
I'm sorry.

237
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,410
This boy has admired you for so long, Mr. Edward.

238
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,540
Admired?

239
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,750
Do you like alchemy, Selim?

240
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,670
I do.

241
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:56,630
My dream is to learn alchemy and become a State Alchemist like Mr. Edward.

242
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,300
Admired me, huh...

243
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,300
Wow...

244
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,180
Then, I want to be useful to Father.

245
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,940
Do you love your Father...

246
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,190
...Führer President King Bradley?

247
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,570
Of course!

248
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,200
What's he like?

249
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,950
He's a very noble man.

250
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:21,580
He perseveres through hard work that would make a normal person cry...

251
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,080
...and works every day with only one thing in mind: the well-being of his people.

252
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,620
I see.

253
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,840
The Führer President does  seem busy all the time.

254
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,260
Yes, he is.

255
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:38,760
He still plans on working to his fullest in active service.

256
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,760
I'm constantly telling him to retire already, bearing his age in mind.

257
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:46,890
He's always been someone totally committed to his work.

258
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:53,270
He can do his job, but he's always been a blockhead when it comes to women.

259
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:57,900
He was so impolite; I gave him a good slap across the face.

260
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,660
Well, that's where it all started. Then, we started dating.

261
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,790
And our first date was...

262
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,660
Oh, my.

263
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,120
I didn't mean to talk about senseless things.

264
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:20,340
Father!

265
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,050
What a surprise!

266
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,890
Welcome home!

267
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,810
Thanks, Selim.

268
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,930
Why the surprise visit?

269
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,860
I had some rare free time, so I came to see your faces.

270
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:38,440
Then, I heard the Fullmetal Alchemist was here.

271
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,610
Hello.

272
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,030
It's been a while.

273
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,780
We just saw each other at Central Headquarters, didn't we?

274
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,670
I see. So you met each other at the library.

275
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,840
Yep!

276
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:03,050
What, are you trying to say that we don't look alike?

277
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,810
N-No, that's not it...

278
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,560
We're not connected by blood.

279
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,100
We were never able to have kids.

280
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,570
So we adopted him from a relative.

281
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,740
He grew up to become a kind boy who cares so much for his parents.

282
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,320
Stop it, Father.

283
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,120
It's embarrassing.

284
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,030
I'm only stating the truth.

285
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,000
Is something the matter?

286
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,590
N-No, it's just that we only see you when you're working at Headquarters.

287
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,720
So it's just... right, Brother?

288
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,350
I guess we're just stunned to see such a different side of you.

289
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,220
I see.

290
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,430
I, too, have family.

291
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,230
Even someone like me.

292
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,980
Although it's a bit different from your family.

293
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,660
Are you leaving already, Father?

294
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,420
Yeah. It's about time for me to return to the office.

295
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,800
Enjoy your stay,

296
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,300
State Alchemist.

297
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:35,810
Let's go.

298
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,620
Come visit again!

299
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,870
Okay, thanks.

300
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:05,760
I don't think his wife or son know that he's a Homunculus...

301
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,730
Anyway, we need to head north! All the way!

302
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:19,940
We need to get a hold of that midget and
make her tell us the secret behind Eastern Alchemy!

303
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,730
Right!

304
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,870
We'll be there by morning.

305
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:29,990
Sleep for now.

306
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:52,470
I see... so you let them get away again.

307
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,850
This is a map of the West, correct?

308
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,230
Yes, sir.

309
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,940
He was last seen...

310
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,030
Here.

311
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,110
And this is West City.

312
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,330
Scar and Marcoh disappeared somewhere in between.

313
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:22,590
A train must slow down significantly at a curve, correct?

314
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,010
Is it possible for someone to jump off?

315
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,220
I wouldn't say it's impossible, but it's very dangerous.

316
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,300
I see.

317
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,230
Well then, I wonder which direction they ran after they jumped off?

318
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,190
North...

319
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,400
...or south...

320
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:11,730
Even if we part and meet again, I want to meet at this place.

321
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:11,730
Megurimeguttemo mata koko de aitai

322
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:18,660
Then we'll hold hands to ensure we'll never be separated again.

323
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:18,660
Hagurenaiyouni kono te wo tsunagunda

324
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,290
We used to talk all night until the sun rose,

325
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,290
Asahi ga noboru made katariattane

326
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:24,120
And held hands till the sun went under the horizon.

327
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:24,120
Yuuhi ga shizumu made tsunaida te

328
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:29,370
Let's walk together like this forever, like light and shadow.

329
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:29,370
Kouyatte asu mo asatte mo tomo ni ayumou hikari to kage

330
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,920
I stand in the city, staring off into space with lonely eyes.

331
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,920
Samishige ni mitsumeru machi no naka de

332
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:39,260
Nukumori wa hitori ja mitsukaranakute

333
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:39,260
I can't find warmth on my own.

334
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:44,770
By meeting you, I realized

335
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:44,770
Ai ga konnani tsuyosa ni narukoto

336
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:50,600
How much strength love could give me.

337
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:50,600
Shittanda kimi ni deaete hajimete

338
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:55,860
Even if we part and meet again, I want to meet at this place.

339
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:55,860
Megurimeguttemo mata koko de aitai

340
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:01,160
Then we'll hold hands to ensure we'll never be separated again.

341
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:01,160
Hagurenaiyouni kono te wo tsunagunda

342
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:06,370
I can't sleep by myself, 'cause I can't dream without you.

343
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:06,370
Hitori ja nemurenai yume wa mirenaikara

344
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:12,130
Donna fuan mo todokanai tokoro e

345
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:12,130
So take me to a place where uncertainty can't reach us

346
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:17,380
And let us bring light to the night sky with no stars.

347
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:17,380
Hoshi no yoru mo terashitsuzukeyou

348
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,880
So long as you're with me, I can go to world's end.

349
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,880
Doko made mo yukeru kimi to nara

350
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,890
Even if it's a path I can't walk on my own,

351
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,890
Hitori ja arukenai michi mo futari nara

352
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,930
If you're by my side, I can walk it while humming a tune.

353
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,930
Hanauta utainagara arukerunda

354
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:29,350
If we're together, the world is mine.

355
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:29,350
Kimi ga ireba shiawase

356
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:38,180
Could it be our first time traveling north?

357
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,220
Yeah.

358
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,180
I wonder if we'll be able to see snow?

359
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,600
Snow, huh...

360
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:47,980
I guess it rarely stuck to the ground in Resembool.

361
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:01,120
The cat and the mouse.

362
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,370
Insanity and hatred clash in a white world.

363
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:10,040
The fiercest battle yet opens the gate to a new world.

364
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:15,590
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

365
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:20,120
Episode 33, The Northern Wall of Briggs.

366
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:20,120
The Northern Wall
of Briggs

367
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,310
Her golden hair is a flame made of ice.
