1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:06,190
Drawn by a landscape as white as snow,

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:06,190
Masshiro na keshiki ni ima sasowarete

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,740
I'm headed toward an unseen world.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,740
Boku wa yuku yo mada minu sekai e

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,680
I've been traveling while lost

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,680
Maigo no mama tabi shiteita

7
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,470
Under this gray sky.

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,460
Nezumiiro no sora no shita

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,560
Every day with new maps, stained with my many dreams.

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,560
Higawari no chizu ikutsumo no yume ga nijindeita

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,950
I wonder if someday,

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,950
Itsuka wa sa

13
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,990
Even with these tiny steps of mine,

14
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,990
Chippoke na boku no kono hohaba demo

15
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:43,070
I'll be able to travel beyond those clouds.

16
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:43,070
Ano kumo no mukou made yukeru kana

17
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,700
I put on a bold front.

18
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,700
Tsuyogatte

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,250
End up hurting myself.

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,250
Kizutsuita

21
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,330
I feel empty inside.

22
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,330
Kokoro sukashita youni

23
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,870
It's started to rain,

24
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,870
Furidashita

25
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,040
Amatsubu tachi ga

26
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,040
And the raindrops

27
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,260
Began to repeat their scattered reflections.

28
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,260
Ranhansha kurikaesu

29
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,130
These straight rays of light

30
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,130
Massugu na hikari ga

31
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,850
Start to cross one another.

32
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,850
Kousa shite

33
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,430
And without telling anyone where they're headed,

34
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,430
Yakusaki mo tsugenumama

35
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,720
Across the endless distances,

36
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,720
Doko made mo

37
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,310
They pass through all matter.

38
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,310
Tsukinukeru

39
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:14,140
I burn these faint afterimages onto my eyes.

40
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:14,140
Awai zanzou ryoume ni yakitsukete

41
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,060
Under this sky,

42
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,060
Kono sora no shita

43
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,890
Wherever I am,

44
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,890
Donna toko ni itemo

45
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,190
I should be able to reach

46
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,190
Todoku hazu nanda

47
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:27,000
The unseen world.

48
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:27,000
Mada minu sekai e

49
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,980
Hey! Anyone here?!

50
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,400
Answer me, Al!!

51
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,900
Where the hell am I?!

52
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,900
Dammit...

53
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,280
Lin!

54
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,030
Stupid prince!

55
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,660
Who are you calling stupid?

56
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,750
Lin!

57
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,250
Is that any way to speak to a prince?

58
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,170
You're safe!

59
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,550
You...

60
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,510
What?

61
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,510
You're not actually Envy disguised as Lin, are you?

62
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,260
Come on...

63
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,180
Do you want me to recite the entire room service menu?!

64
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,600
Okay, you're not fake.

65
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,810
You're not a fake either, are you? You pea--

66
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,560
Who are you calling a pea-sized runt?!

67
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,230
Okay, you pass.

68
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,260
Doorway of Darkness

69
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,360
But seriously, where are we?

70
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,410
If I recall, we were swallowed up by Gluttony, and...

71
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,790
Yeah, but there's no way his stomach could be this big.

72
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,000
But...

73
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,710
Look.

74
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,220
It's the deserted house we were just in.

75
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,590
And this...

76
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,470
The Lieutenant's car?

77
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,480
I think it's safe to assume that all this fire came from the Colonel.

78
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,350
Yeah.

79
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,650
Which means...

80
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,860
...we're really inside Gluttony's stomach?

81
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,860
No idea.

82
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,400
But I can at least tell you we're not in Heaven.

83
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,530
Let me see this.

84
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,820
What's up?

85
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,330
Lin, look at this.

86
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,330
Isn't that Al's?

87
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,250
If we can only find his arm,
that means Al wasn't swallowed with us.

88
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,340
Thank goodness.

89
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,220
I bet Al is worried sick.

90
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,680
We've got no idea where we are, either.

91
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,440
Now's the perfect time for them to awaken!
My telepathic abilities!

92
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,560
Elric telepathy!

93
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,360
Hear me, Brother!

94
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,070
Have fun with that.

95
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,410
I see a lot of buildings and corpses,
but they're all from different times...

96
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,290
Is there even an exit to this place?

97
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,660
I don't know. And if there isn't, I'll make one.

98
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,080
And where are you going to make one?

99
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,340
All right, throw that stick in.

100
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,380
I see what you're up to.

101
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:08,920
There.

102
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,560
I don't think it's hit the bottom yet...

103
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,900
A wall! Let's look for a wall!

104
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,980
Yeah! No matter how big the place is, we'll eventually reach the edge if we just keep moving forward!

105
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:30,240
We should be able to find the exit, too!

106
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,490
I couldn't find her...

107
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,580
Where did you go, Shao May?

108
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,540
Maybe it got eaten up by a stray dog or something?

109
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,790
A stray?

110
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
That was a joke! I'm sorry!

111
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,800
She...

112
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:56,760
Shao May is a panda who has had a minor disorder since birth, which prevented her from getting any bigger.

113
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,810
I found her after she was abandoned by her parents...

114
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,650
...and we've been raised like sisters ever since.

115
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:14,320
My clan, the Chang, barely has any authority in Xing, making us one of the weakest clans.

116
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,910
Maybe that's why.

117
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,670
How can I put it... we were both attracted to each other because of our similar standings...

118
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,090
Yes. It may have been sympathy at first...

119
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:47,190
...but we were raised like family, carried the same burdens...

120
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:52,400
...and she eventually became someone irreplaceable to me.

121
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:01,290
There are lots of things I was able to go through, just because she was there.

122
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,670
I wouldn't have been able to cross the desert without her.

123
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,420
I don't think you really had to cross it in the first place.

124
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,340
Why would you do all this for something uncertain like immortality?

125
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:19,510
If I don't bring back the method of immortality...
If I don't present it to the Emperor and earn his favor...

126
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,680
My clan will die out at this rate.

127
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,810
That's why I came here with her...

128
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,230
With her...

129
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,480
Shao May!

130
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,480
Stop crying! I'm begging you!

131
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,950
Master.

132
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,580
We still have some time before the sun rises.

133
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,790
There shouldn't be alot of military police on-duty at this time.

134
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,420
Huh?!

135
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,300
You'll help me look for her?

136
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,390
You're such a nice person.

137
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,890
His people died out in that civil war.

138
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:10,770
So maybe he's empathizing with you and your weak clan?

139
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,740
What's wrong? Aren't you going to look for her?

140
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,160
Okay! I'm coming!

141
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:28,830
Having to walk in all this really drains your stamina, doesn't it...

142
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:33,590
Yeah. And no signs of an exit, either...

143
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,720
I'm so hungry...

144
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:44,390
If we manage to get out, I'll let you eat all you want.

145
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:48,440
Eat all you want, sleep all you want, and...

146
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,650
Lin?

147
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,980
I can't take this anymore...

148
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:58,200
Come on, giving up already?

149
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,820
You're pathetic.

150
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,990
You going to collapse here, too?!

151
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,990
Get up! Walk!

152
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,330
I'm leaving you behind, dammit!

153
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,000
Then go...

154
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,290
You weakling!

155
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,750
I'm going!

156
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,550
I can't die here.

157
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,390
I'm really going to go ahead!

158
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,270
Not joking, you know!

159
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,360
Didn't you say you were going to go ahead?

160
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,700
I definitely don't want to die with you.

161
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,870
But you've got people waiting for you, too, don't you?

162
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,500
Hey, if you have the strength to talk, then...

163
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,720
If only we had something to eat...

164
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,680
Did you know, Lin?

165
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,810
Leather goods are edible.

166
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,730
Should be done by now...

167
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,280
Here.

168
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,910
You don't have athlete's foot, do you?

169
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,910
Do I look like I do, dumbass?!

170
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,910
What a meal.

171
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,250
Sorry about all this.

172
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,710
What do you mean?

173
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,920
If you hadn't tried to save me back then...

174
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,840
Forget it.

175
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,840
This is nothing compared to the training I went through as a kid.

176
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,890
It's kind of annoying we don't know where we are,

177
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:51,480
but we can search for the exit now that we've had our beans.

178
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,600
An optimist, are you?

179
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,440
I'm just relentless about staying alive.

180
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,190
If I even thought about giving up,
I'd get beaten and scolded by Al.

181
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,490
What's wrong?

182
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,410
Something's coming.

183
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,370
That's...

184
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,660
Oh, it's you guys.

185
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,710
Envy, just as I thought!

186
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,040
Please, tell us where the exit is!

187
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,840
That's pathetic, Edward Elric!

188
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,510
Shut up! Humans would do anything to live!

189
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,050
Despicable!

190
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,380
Unfortunately...

191
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:24,670
Shut up!

192
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,380
You're despicable!

193
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,050
...there's no exit.

194
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,430
Shut up! Shut up!

195
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,220
You really had to do that, didn't you?

196
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,980
Even I got dragged in because of you.

197
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,440
Where are we?

198
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,980
Are we really inside Gluttony's stomach?

199
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,730
We're inside his stomach, and at the same time, we're not.

200
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,610
Fullmetal ru-

201
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:48,990
I mean, Fullmetal Alchemist, shouldn't you have realized where we are by now?

202
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,790
Now that you mention it,
when I was sucked in by Gluttony...

203
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,830
I recognize that sensation...

204
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,210
Don't you?

205
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,090
Since you've gone through it in the past.

206
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,470
The Gate of Truth!

207
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,430
But this isn't how it was.

208
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,730
It was all white, and there was a gate...

209
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,900
Oh, so that's how the real one is.

210
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,820
"Real"?

211
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:28,070
Gluttony is the result of Father's unsuccessful attempt at recreating the Gate of Truth.

212
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,700
What... did you say?

213
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:38,580
A poorly-made Gate of Truth that even Father couldn't get right.

214
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,340
I guess it's safe to call this place the crevice between reality and the truth.

215
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,210
The crevice?!

216
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:48,720
There's no exit, nor a way to get out of here.

217
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:52,800
All we can do now is to wait until
the span of our lives comes to an end.

218
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,470
All we can do...

219
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,520
...is wait until we die here.

220
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,900
No...

221
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,530
No way in hell I'll let that happen!

222
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,330
Don't screw around with me!

223
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,490
Envy!

224
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,660
Hey!

225
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,370
There's no exit?

226
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,670
We're going to die here?

227
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,380
Hey... Hey...

228
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,420
Hang on.

229
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:31,050
If I die here, what will Al do?

230
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,970
I promised him...

231
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,060
I promised him we'd get our bodies back together.

232
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,850
Dammit!

233
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,440
Who the hell is this Father guy that tried to recreate the Gate?!

234
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,270
Führer President Bradley?!

235
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,900
Bradley?

236
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,240
Not even close.

237
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,240
He's just a Homunculus.

238
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,490
I knew it...

239
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,750
Research Laboratory 5.

240
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,830
Using people's lives.

241
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,750
Philosopher's stones.

242
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,380
Homunculus.

243
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,300
If the Führer President is also a Homunculus, then that means it was you guys who started the Ishbal conflict...

244
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,880
Ishbal?!

245
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,760
That was the most amusing task I'd ever been given!

246
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,890
Do you know what started that civil war in the first place?

247
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:26,900
If I recall, an army officer accidentally killed an Ishbalan child...

248
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,440
That's right.

249
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,450
I'm the one who shot the kid dead.

250
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:57,640
Umm...

251
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,140
I heard about Ishbal from Yoki.

252
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,730
That felt amazing.

253
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,780
Watching the civil war spread indefinitely from a single bullet.

254
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:17,280
Man, it was really refreshing!

255
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,410
Oh, by the way.

256
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:27,580
I disguised myself as a moderate officer who was against the military intervention of Ishbal.

257
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,170
Hear this!

258
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:35,180
He couldn't even give an excuse for it and was sentenced to death by court-martial!

259
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,350
Humans are so easy to manipulate.

260
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,980
So it was you...

261
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,520
The one who shot an innocent child dead...

262
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:53,280
The one who destroyed our hometown... The one who drove away the Ishbalans...

263
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:56,570
The one who created Scar, a vengeful murderer...

264
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,620
The root cause...

265
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:02,080
...of what killed Winry's parents...

266
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,290
You bastard!!!

267
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,750
What?

268
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,800
He didn't give an inch...

269
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,880
You brats want to fight?

270
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,630
Ed, pull back!

271
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,020
We're all going to die here anyway.

272
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,440
I'll show you something cool as a final gift.

273
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,860
Did you look beneath his feet when you were fighting him in the woods?

274
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,690
No.

275
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,240
That means...

276
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,530
He may not look like it, but he weighs quite a bit.

277
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,120
His true form must be...

278
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,630
Dammit...

279
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,760
What the hell is this?!

280
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,010
How could that be a Homunculus...

281
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,100
An artificial human?!

282
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,120
What...

283
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,670
...should I do?

284
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,750
Hell if I know.

285
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,380
What should I do... I'll...

286
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:44,430
I'll get yelled at by Father!

287
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:49,230
Father? You have a dad?

288
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,140
I do.

289
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,610
The one who created the Homunculi?

290
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,520
Yes.

291
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,570
What happens to the mass you swallow...

292
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,330
Is there a trick to it?

293
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:08,660
Think... Think!

294
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,660
We decided we'd get our bodies back together!

295
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,250
I can't give up here!

296
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:20,090
Gluttony, take me to your Father.

297
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:23,890
Okay.

298
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,220
You're a human sacrifice, right?

299
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,230
Y-Yeah, that's right. I'm a human sacrifice!

300
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,310
What the heck does he mean by that?

301
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:44,030
The only ones currently confirmed as such are the Elric brothers.

302
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,700
What about Doctor Marcoh?

303
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,030
You would think that it's about time...

304
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,490
There's Kimblee, too.

305
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:53,870
He doesn't have the nerve to open the Gate.

306
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:59,590
Well, what about Mustang, the other sacrifice candidate?

307
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:04,550
The Führer President wants to have a long chat with him.

308
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,140
Why are you letting me live?

309
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,020
To make you understand where you stand.

310
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,020
Since when has the military been beholden to the Homunculi?

311
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:24,950
It has been set up that way ever since this country was first reformed.

312
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:29,780
So you've been smiling with glee, watching us struggle.

313
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:34,710
Your hands that were shaking during Brigadier General Hughes' funeral...

314
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,670
Was that just an act?!

315
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:43,420
Everyone makes too big a deal out of the death of a soldier.

316
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:49,550
They should have known his military uniform might become his burial attire.

317
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:57,480
Brigadier General Hughes' daughter was so annoying during the funeral.

318
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,070
She really got on my nerves.

319
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,190
If I recall, you also have a child.

320
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,740
How could you say such a thing?

321
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,240
Are you referring to Selim?

322
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,990
He's a good boy.

323
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:17,830
I wonder how he'd react if he were to find out that his father, a man of utmost standing, is a Homunculus.

324
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,170
Are you trying to blackmail me?

325
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,210
It is futile.

326
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:28,090
He won't become my weakness.

327
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,100
But you're different.

328
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:35,100
She'll become your weakness.

329
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:39,980
Lieutenant Hawkeye!

330
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,230
What is it?

331
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,110
Someone from the personnel bureau dropped by earlier.

332
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:49,410
I was transferred to Southern Headquarters.

333
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,820
What?!

334
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,370
Not just me, either.

335
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:56,330
Second Lieutenant Breda was transferred to Western Headquarters,

336
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,080
and Warrant Officer Falman was transferred to Northern Headquarters.

337
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,220
You're Lieutenant Hawkeye, correct?

338
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:13,970
Yes, sir.

339
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,810
I'm Yakovleff, from the personnel bureau.

340
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,560
Personnel bureau...

341
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,310
I'm Shtolhi, an assistant to the Führer President.

342
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,270
Take this.

343
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,280
Is this a transfer order?

344
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,610
Correct.

345
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,200
Please allow me to review it.

346
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,040
This is...

347
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,370
What is with this insane personnel change?!

348
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,920
Where were you assigned?

349
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:48,800
"Starting tomorrow, Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye will be stationed at Central Headquarters..."

350
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,890
"...as an assistant to the Führer President."

351
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,930
And that's how it is.

352
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:58,930
Colonel Roy Mustang.

353
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,360
How delightful!

354
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,780
Damn, this isn't delightful at all.

355
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,700
Not the least bit.

356
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,000
Lin!

357
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,290
Ed!

358
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,130
Can you make a weapon?

359
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,380
Leave it to me!

360
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,550
We're in a sea of blood.

361
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:37,010
There's plenty of iron here!

362
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,810
You have bad taste.

363
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:48,230
How so? I think it looks cool.

364
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:53,700
Can you do it?

365
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,530
I don't know...

366
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,200
Look at that figure.

367
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,040
And to top it off, that earlier attack broke a few of my ribs.

368
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,210
Same here.

369
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:08,090
But I won't be satisfied until I give him a good beatdown!

370
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,470
Gluttony, are you sure we're going the right way?

371
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,050
Yeah.

372
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,890
But this way... we're headed toward...

373
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,060
Your Father is in Central?!

374
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:37,380
I don't have to act tough, right?

375
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:37,380
Tsuyogaranakute iindane

376
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:44,180
The scribbling someone made...

377
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:44,180
Dareka ga kaitetta

378
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:49,980
On the wall, of a flower is swaying.

379
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:49,980
Kabe no rakugaki no hana ga yureru

380
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,560
No one knows their true selves.

381
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,560
Jibunrashisa nante dermo wakaranaiyo

382
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,860
Even though we both lose and gain

383
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,860
Nagai nagai michi no tochuu de

384
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,280
By embarking on this long, long path,

385
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,280
Nakushitari hirottari

386
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:08,950
And though there may be days loneliness strikes and makes us weep...

387
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:08,950
Kyuu ni samishikunatte naichau hi mo arukedo

388
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:16,460
Namida mo itami mo hoshi ni kaeyou

389
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:16,460
Let's transform our tears and pains to stars.

390
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:22,460
Let's light a candle to illuminate our tomorrow.

391
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:22,460
Ashita wo terasu akari wo tomosou

392
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,590
And we'll hold our small hands over the fire to create stardust,

393
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,590
Chiisana te kazashite futari de tsukurou

394
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:32,810
And an eternity that shines so brilliantly.

395
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:32,810
Hoshikuzu wo tsuyoku hikaru eien wo

396
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:38,190
Farewells may be unavoidable,

397
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:38,190
Sayonara itsuka wa kurukamoshirenai

398
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:44,110
Yet the seasons continue to change obliviously.

399
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:44,110
Kisetsu wa soredemo meguri megutteku

400
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,200
Chiisaku mayottemo aruiteku

401
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,200
Even if I lose myself, I'll continue to walk...

402
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,240
Walk by your side.

403
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,240
Kimi to aruiteku

404
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,540
That's the only thing I'd like to never change.

405
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,540
Sore dake wa kawaranaideiyoune

406
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:03,640
Is the soul acting in the shadows a guidepost to the future?

407
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:06,600
Fight, boy,

408
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,730
if you are to see the truth and discover the depth of darkness.

409
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:16,200
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

410
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,700
Reunion

411
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,700
Episode 26, Reunion.

412
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,450
I won't say farewell...

413
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:25,950
...because I believe we'll meet again.
