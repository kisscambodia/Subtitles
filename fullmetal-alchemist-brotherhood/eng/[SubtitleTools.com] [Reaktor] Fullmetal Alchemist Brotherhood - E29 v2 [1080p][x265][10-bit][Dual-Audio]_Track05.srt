1
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,870
Can't focus. My body is still puzzled about what to do.

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,870
Shuuchuu dekitenaina mada karada ga mayotteirunda

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,630
I'm trembling. I can't stop even if I try to control myself.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,630
Furueteitanja kontoroorushitatte burerunda

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,380
Although neither sun nor moon are on my side,

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,380
Taiyou mo tsuki mo nanmo kanzen ni kocchi muiteinaiga

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,800
"I've no choice but to try,"

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,800
Yarushikanainda

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,470
Those were the words I muttered to myself.

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,470
Iikikaseruyouni sotto tsubuyaita

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,060
The odds aren't on my side, but running way'd be gutless.

12
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,060
Joukyou wa waruiga tada nigedasunja konjou nainaa

13
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,060
Even if I can't see the future, I'll just have to win it over with courage.

14
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,060
Tenbou wa naiga dokyou de kuria suru shika naiya

15
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,560
Need to keep distance from the target as I hold myself back.

16
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,560
Shoudou wa osaetamama taagetto to no kankaku sagure

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,860
All that's needed for victory is pride to win.

18
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,860
Hitsuyou na mon wa katsu puraido

19
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,950
Will we celebrate with the wine of victory

20
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,950
Ajiwau nowa shouri no bishu ka

21
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,950
Or'll we end up kissing their feet in defeat?

22
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,950
Soretomo haiboku no kujuu ka

23
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,700
There are two outcomes to everything.

24
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,700
Sou subete wa futatsu ni hitotsu

25
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,420
I want to control destiny.

26
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,420
Ayatsuritai unmei no ito

27
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,750
I need to seize the golden opportunity with my hands.

28
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,750
Zekkou no goorudentaimu kono te de tsukame

29
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,840
I'll finish it up with my best poker face,

30
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,840
Konshin no pookaafeisu kimete shikakeruyo

31
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,800
And drag them into a world of illusions.

32
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,800
Iryuujon no sekai e hikizurikonde

33
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,140
I'll find my way out of this endless pressure game,

34
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,140
Saigennai puresshaageemu sururito nukete

35
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,150
And leap over the borderline of honor.

36
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,150
Eikou no boodaarain tobikoeru tameni

37
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,860
How many? What'll I need to sacrifice to make it happen?

38
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,860
Haumenii? Dorekurai no daishou ga iru?

39
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,120
What is the one thing I don't want to let go?

40
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,120
Tebanashitakunai mon wa dore?

41
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,530
Hey, where the hell are you taking us?

42
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,610
Get in.

43
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,300
This is...

44
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,180
Military Headquarters?!

45
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,680
What does this mean?!

46
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:11,720
Hey.

47
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,520
You guys are filthy.

48
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,650
I wouldn't have dreamed the Homunculi's hideout was under Headquarters...

49
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:26,780
So it means that the army is also associated with them, not just the Führer President.

50
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,620
But I've got something good to tell you, too.

51
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,080
Really?! You really found my body?!

52
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,210
Yeah.

53
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:43,460
Although you told me,
"You're not my soul, so I can't come with you."

54
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,010
Great, so my body still exists!

55
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,720
Awesome! Awesome!

56
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,720
Okay!

57
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,810
This just means we're one step closer to our goal.

58
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,610
Hey, why do you still have that cat?

59
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,940
Oh, her?

60
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,280
Actually, inside of me, there's...

61
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,940
What?!

62
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,650
That midget?!

63
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,700
Brother! Stop being so loud!

64
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,990
Hurry and put your underwear on!

65
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,240
What are you guys doing?! Hurry up!

66
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,210
No!!!

67
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,070
Struggle of the Fool

68
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,430
Geez, why the hell did you have to bring her?

69
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,260
There was no other choice. She's injured.

70
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:31,970
Hey!

71
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,180
I'm leaving the rest to Wrath. Go in.

72
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,680
Wrath?

73
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,240
Wrath...

74
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,450
Führer President King Bradley?!

75
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,530
Colonel!

76
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,830
What the hell happened?

77
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,250
Quite a bit.

78
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,540
Sergeant Fuery was transferred to the South, Warrant Officer Falman to the North,

79
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,540
and Second Lieutenant Breda to the West.

80
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,920
And Lieutenant Hawkeye is going to be an assistant to the Führer President.

81
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,220
What the hell...

82
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,560
That's no more than taking hostages.

83
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,560
Have a seat.

84
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,570
Right now, it's just us and the Führer President in this room.

85
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,190
And he only has one weapon; a sword.

86
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,030
Yet, he's still confident he can beat all three of us?

87
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,540
Führer President!

88
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,960
You came to visit me in the hospital once, right?

89
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,800
I was completely fooled.

90
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:51,510
"Don't meddle in things.
Think of the entire army as your enemy."

91
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,800
That's what I told you.

92
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,970
You are all important to us.

93
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,680
You don't need to know about the minor details,

94
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,100
but behave until the time comes.

95
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:07,070
As long as you keep that promise, we won't harm you.

96
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:12,950
And when that time comes, what'll happen to the civilians who aren't "human sacrifices" like us?

97
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,910
I just told you. You don't need to know the minor details,

98
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,700
Fullmetal Alchemist.

99
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,710
"Fullmetal Alchemist", eh?

100
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:27,960
I chose to become a dog of the military in order to get my body back.

101
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:35,050
But the State Alchemist Institution itself was probably created to pick out these sacrifices.

102
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,430
If I'm going to be used by you guys again on top of that...

103
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,640
I quit my job as a State Alchemist!

104
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:48,400
Your proof of being a dog is covered in blood.

105
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,650
Whatever you guys are planning, I'll put an end to it.

106
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,200
I'll tell the other alchemists, and...

107
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,910
What was her name again?

108
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,080
Oh, that's right. Winry Rockbell.

109
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,500
Born in Resembool.

110
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,500
A childhood friend of yours
and someone who is practically family.

111
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,840
A skilled automail mechanic.

112
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:16,680
She currently works at Rush Valley,
and she's loved by her customers and friends.

113
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,720
She's a good, obedient girl.

114
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,180
Lay a finger on her and see what happens! People around her, too!

115
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,560
So, what are you going to do?

116
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,280
If you still want to quit, then I'll cut her down.

117
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,290
Excellent.

118
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,290
Excuse me...

119
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,040
We get the idea.

120
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,420
So, umm...

121
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:54,550
Like before, please let us continue to search for clues
for getting our bodies back while being under surveillance.

122
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,170
Please.

123
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,590
Very well.

124
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,180
As long as you don't interfere with our plan.

125
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,220
What will you do, Colonel Mustang?

126
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,310
You're not going to tell me that you plan to resign from the military too, are you?

127
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,980
Let's see... even if I became a dog of the military, I'd rather not become a loser.

128
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:20,490
Either way, because of my ambition, I won't be able to take off this uniform or get rid of this. For now, at least.

129
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,870
Very well.

130
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,490
You all may leave.

131
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,420
May I ask you one thing, sir?

132
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,750
What is it, Colonel?

133
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,840
Are you the one who killed Hughes?

134
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,380
No, it was not me.

135
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,640
Then who?

136
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,140
You said "one thing", did you not?

137
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,100
Please excuse me.

138
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,600
Oh. Wait a moment, Alphonse.

139
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,990
U-Umm... Is there something...

140
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,870
No, you may leave now.

141
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,710
That was so close!

142
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,000
A sword just went right over my head...

143
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,170
Oh yeah, Colonel.

144
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,970
Money. Lend me some change.

145
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,550
What's this all of a sudden?

146
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,180
Don't worry about it!

147
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,850
Man, this is all you got?

148
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,520
What are you, a thief?!

149
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,600
Oh well.

150
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Later!

151
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,100
H-Hey!

152
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,690
Sorry, Colonel!

153
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,020
We'll report everything later!

154
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,730
What in the world are they up to?

155
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,280
Oh no, the Lieutenant!

156
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,290
Lieute-

157
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,170
Is something the matter, Colonel?

158
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,040
You don't look very well.

159
00:08:54,210 --> 00:09:00,170
Can you blame me for feeling sick after seeing a musclehead when I was expecting to see a woman?

160
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,420
Colonel!

161
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,300
Lieutenant.

162
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,590
Is everything okay?

163
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,300
Oh, my apologies.

164
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,560
Lieutenant Hawkeye, just returning from the restroom, sir.

165
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,310
I accepted Major Armstrong's kindness and had him take my place for a short time.

166
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,110
Thank you, Major.

167
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,570
No problem at all.

168
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,530
You didn't run away?

169
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:24,780
Who's the one who told me
to never give up no matter what?

170
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,790
Don't regret later that you didn't run away, Lieutenant.

171
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,580
Like I will after all this time...

172
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,000
Hello?

173
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,170
Ed? What's with the sudden call?

174
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,220
Did you break your automail again?

175
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,260
No!

176
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,840
Hey, are you okay?

177
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,010
Are you doing well?

178
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,930
Anything new in your life?

179
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,310
You're not being stalked by anyone, are you?

180
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,520
Ed...

181
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:54,520
What is it?!

182
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,020
You're being creepy.

183
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,770
What did you say?!

184
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:05,200
I mean, it's rare enough for you to call, and it turns out you're worried about me?

185
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,280
Geez, there's something wrong here.
I bet it's going to snow tonight or something.

186
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,330
Hey! Do you have any idea how much I-

187
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,160
Hey, thanks.

188
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,830
I'm happy you called.

189
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:16,920
Thanks.

190
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,380
S-Sure.

191
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,460
So you're really okay, right?

192
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,550
Got it. Bye.

193
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,220
Good, she was fine...

194
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,680
It's your excitable nature that lets people take advantage of you.

195
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,730
Ling!

196
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,850
I told you, I'm Greed.

197
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,900
What the hell do you want?!

198
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,190
Your buddy asked me to give you this.

199
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,150
Ling did?

200
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,110
This is in Xing's language, huh...

201
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,700
What's it say?

202
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,620
I don't know. Can't read it.

203
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,370
He wants you to give it to the woman waiting for him.

204
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,240
Lan Fa-

205
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:56,210
You're not planning on following us and killing her, are you?

206
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,420
I'm not that low.

207
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,710
Besides, I don't like fighting girls.

208
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:05,630
I don't lie.

209
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,970
Later. Be sure to give it to her.

210
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,470
Hey, Ling!

211
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,810
I'm Greed.

212
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,450
Who the hell was that?

213
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,620
What reason did he have to start the civil war
when it would ruin this country?

214
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,790
Who is it?

215
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,590
Is someone up there?

216
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,180
You're injured.

217
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,220
Could you come down?

218
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,680
I'd like to know what's going on outside.

219
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,940
It's fine; the guard won't be coming again for a while.

220
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,060
I'm also a doctor. I'll tend your wounds.

221
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,610
An Ishbalan, huh?

222
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,110
That scar on your forehead...

223
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,530
Don't tell me... You're Scar?!

224
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,620
Who the hell are you?

225
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,290
What are you doing here?

226
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,550
Oh, God!

227
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,800
I'm...

228
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:33,300
I'm also an alchemist who assisted in the Ishbal Extermination!

229
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,690
She'll be fine. Nothing life-threatening.

230
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,440
She'll get better as long as she gets some rest.

231
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,810
Thank goodness.

232
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,270
"Thank goodness" my ass!

233
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,820
Giving me more patients by the day!

234
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,570
Both my bed and sofa are occupied!

235
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,320
Where the hell am I supposed to sleep, huh?!

236
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,530
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

237
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:58,200
Besides, two patients in my house at once?!

238
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,040
Alphonse.

239
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,200
Lan Fan!

240
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,620
You shouldn't be up!

241
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,790
Is... Is the young master not with you?

242
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,000
I-It's fine. He's alive.

243
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,510
I have a message from him.

244
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,310
Lan Fan?

245
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,400
He says... He says he's obtained a philosopher's stone...

246
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,940
With this, our clan is...

247
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:33,280
That's right! I must return to my country immediately and tell my people!

248
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,990
Where is he? Where is the young master?

249
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,200
What? Why won't you speak?

250
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,580
Don't tell me something happened to him!

251
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,460
Answer me, Alphonse!

252
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,830
Where is the young master?!

253
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,300
How is your body feeling, Greed?

254
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,220
So you're Wrath.

255
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,550
I'm feeling fine.

256
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:00,640
Did you hear? This body belongs to a prince of Xing.

257
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:06,100
He wanted power that would help him become Emperor, and thus accepted me.

258
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,770
He's a really interesting guy.

259
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:14,400
Him and I once had a discussion on what it means to be a true king.

260
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:20,410
He said something like, "A King exists for his people. Without his people, there is no King."

261
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,500
What an idiot. He gave in to greed and lost everything.

262
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,040
Shut up!

263
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,250
Don't underestimate us humans!

264
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,670
That's how it is.

265
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:37,510
He's vigilantly watching for a chance to take over.

266
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,890
He's even planning on taking control of a monster?

267
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,480
How greedy can these humans get?

268
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,360
The Führer President is a Homunculus?!

269
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:01,370
It's always been my honor to fight for the weak citizens of this country.

270
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,960
Many people feel the same,
believe in the military, and sign up.

271
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,380
And yet, the military itself...

272
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,800
Why not resign?

273
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,880
With your personality, being a soldier will only hurt you.

274
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:23,770
Sir! This is wrong!

275
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,640
Are you going against military command?!

276
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,060
Whatever! Call for a replacement State Alchemist!

277
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:36,740
I ran from battle during Ishbal...

278
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,910
...because I thought what the army was doing was wrong.

279
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:45,500
But instead, I should have fought against it instead of running away.

280
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:53,750
Since then, not a day has passed that I didn't feel ashamed for bending my principles and fleeing.

281
00:15:54,670 --> 00:16:02,180
And this time, if the army itself is the battlefield, how can I run away again?

282
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,730
What are you going to do now, Colonel?

283
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:11,940
I told the Führer President I wouldn't quit because I still have an ambition.

284
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:19,950
The fact the Führer President revealed he's a Homunculus means that even if he was to be defeated,

285
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,620
there's still someone else in the shadows.

286
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,830
I'm being tested.

287
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,790
Don't you think that's an honor?

288
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,290
You're being pretty calm about this.

289
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,540
I don't know if I'd say that.

290
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:35,800
It was the same when I fought that other Homunculus, Lust, but...

291
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:41,720
Although people accuse me of being a "weapon" and a "monster", when fighting against real monsters...

292
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,680
...I truly feel as though I'm nothing but an ordinary human.

293
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,230
I see.

294
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,230
So the young master took in the stone.

295
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,980
Sorry.

296
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,280
If only we had been able to stop him...

297
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,360
You don't need to apologize.

298
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,240
I am only mad at myself for not being able to fulfill my duty as a bodyguard.

299
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,700
So...

300
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:10,330
So the young master is still inside this Greed person, right?

301
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:17,250
Alphonse, I want a replacement arm. And quick.

302
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,420
But... it'll take some time...

303
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,840
Please introduce me to an automail mechanic! Please!

304
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,520
Okay.

305
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,440
I will soon.

306
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,650
But you have to get better before I do that.

307
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,360
Let's get you something to eat from Dr. Nox...

308
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,070
You can get up now?

309
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,360
Let's see... was your name May Chan?

310
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,360
May?!

311
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,990
What?!

312
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,410
As expected of the Yao Clan's watchdog.

313
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:56,580
And you're... the Chan Clan's successor.

314
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,710
Indeed.

315
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,380
I'm the 17th Princess of Xing, May Chan.

316
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,920
Wait... um...

317
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,010
If you're here in this country, it means... you're after immortality, as well.

318
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,760
I'll never let you and your clan have it!

319
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,060
You won't even be able to find it!

320
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,060
Hang on!

321
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,770
I don't really get it, but let's play nice!

322
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:19,730
Don't interfere with our country's affairs!

323
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,490
Don't underestimate me just because I'm injured.

324
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,490
Same to you!

325
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,580
What the hell are you two doing?!

326
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,210
Patients should be asleep in bed!

327
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,460
Don't interfere with our country's...

328
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,840
Hell if I care about your country's affairs, moron!

329
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,630
Geez!

330
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:44,420
Patients are patients, no matter what country they're in!

331
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:49,970
You're planning on messing up my house even more?

332
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,010
Hey...

333
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:55,310
You've heard about cases where unknown pathogens mysteriously appear in a doctor's house and kill everyone...

334
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,810
...right?!

335
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,030
This place really is a mess.

336
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,200
Doesn't he have anyone to clean for him?

337
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,910
Doctor, look.

338
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:15,000
Oh, so that's where it was.

339
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,170
Wait! Isn't this a picture of your family?!

340
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,500
It's my divorced wife and my son.

341
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,380
What?

342
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,470
I'm free to do whatever I want with my stuff!

343
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,930
Have a cup of coffee after this is all cleaned up.

344
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,480
I'm so glad you came!

345
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,310
Seriously, look at this.

346
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,690
I was at a loss about what to do.

347
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,530
Huh? Now that I think about it, I can use alchemy again.

348
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:02,210
Very nice work! This is all for the repairs.

349
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,630
But seriously, State Alchemists are something else.

350
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:07,130
On a totally different level from other alchemists.

351
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:12,850
The thing is, we asked nearby alchemists to help us this morning.

352
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,310
They were completely useless.

353
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:21,100
They came to the scene all full of themselves, and as soon as they were getting started, they told us it wasn't working.

354
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,190
In the morning...

355
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,270
That's around the time we were underground.

356
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,690
Mr. Alchemist!

357
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,900
Thanks!

358
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,120
Thanks.

359
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,500
Can I really believe what Envy said?

360
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:47,460
That those people are only made of energy, without a body or a soul...

361
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:52,470
Pull yourself together! Think about the future, not the past!

362
00:20:53,220 --> 00:21:00,350
But at that time, other alchemists aside from Al and I were unable to use alchemy.

363
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,230
But that midget and Scar could.

364
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,190
What does this mean?

365
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,240
Alchemy that's different from ours...

366
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,450
If I could find out the secret behind it,

367
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:23,120
there may be a way to get Al's body back and fight against that geezer without using a philosopher's stone...

368
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:31,220
I have to return this to the Lieutenant.

369
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:38,720
Megurimeguttemo mata koko de aitai

370
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:38,720
巡り巡ってもまたここで逢いたい

371
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:38,720
Even if we part and meet again, I want to meet at this place.

372
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:45,650
Then we'll hold hands to ensure we'll never be separated again.

373
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:45,650
はぐれないようにこの手をつなぐんだ

374
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:45,650
Hagurenaiyouni kono te wo tsunagunda

375
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:48,270
We used to talk all night until the sun rose,

376
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:48,270
朝日が昇るまで語り合ったね

377
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:48,270
Asahi ga noboru made katariattane

378
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:51,110
And held hands till the sun went under the horizon.

379
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:51,110
夕陽が沈むまでつないだ手

380
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:51,110
Yuuhi ga shizumu made tsunaida te

381
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:56,370
Kouyatte asu mo asatte mo tomo ni ayumou hikari to kage

382
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:56,370
こうやって明日も明後日も共に歩もう光と影

383
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:56,370
Let's walk together like this forever, like light and shadow.

384
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:01,120
Right now I'm curious what you're holding inside

385
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:01,120
Kimi wa sono mune ni nani wo kakae

386
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:01,120
君 わ その 胸 に 何 を 抱え

387
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:06,750
And what kind of world you've been living in.

388
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:06,750
どんな 世界 に いたんだろう 今 思うよ

389
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:06,750
Donna sekai ni itandarou ima omouyo

390
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,840
寂しげに見つめる街の中で

391
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,840
I stand in the city, staring off into space with lonely eyes.

392
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,840
Samishige ni mitsumeru machi no naka de

393
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:17,180
温もりはひとりじゃ見つからなくて

394
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:17,180
Nukumori wa hitori ja mitsukaranakute

395
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:17,180
I can't find warmth on my own.

396
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:22,480
Ai ga konnani tsuyosa ni narukoto

397
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:22,480
愛がこんなに強さになること

398
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:22,480
By meeting you, I realized

399
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:28,310
How much strength love could give me.

400
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:28,310
知ったんだ　キミに出逢えてはじめて

401
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:28,310
Shittanda kimi ni deaete hajimete

402
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:33,650
巡り巡ってもまたここで逢いたい

403
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:33,650
Even if we part and meet again, I want to meet at this place.

404
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:33,650
Megurimeguttemo mata koko de aitai

405
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:38,820
Then we'll hold hands to ensure we'll never be separated again.

406
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:38,820
はぐれないようにこの手をつなぐんだ

407
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:38,820
Hagurenaiyouni kono te wo tsunagunda

408
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:44,290
Hitori ja nemurenai yume wa mirenaikara

409
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:44,290
一人じゃ眠れない　夢は見れないから

410
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:44,290
I can't sleep by myself, 'cause I can't dream without you.

411
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:49,500
So take me to a place where uncertainty can't reach us

412
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:49,500
どんな不安も届かないところへ

413
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:49,500
Donna fuan mo todokanai tokoro e

414
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,920
And let us bring light to the night sky with no stars.

415
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,920
星のない夜も照らし続けよう

416
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,920
Hoshi no yoru mo terashitsuzukeyou

417
00:22:54,920 --> 00:23:00,350
I can't sleep by myself, 'cause I can't dream without you.

418
00:22:54,920 --> 00:23:00,350
一人じゃ眠れない　夢は見れないから

419
00:22:54,920 --> 00:23:00,350
Hitori ja nemurenai yume wa mirenaikara

420
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:05,520
So take me to a place where uncertainty can't reach us

421
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:05,520
どんな不安も届かないところへ

422
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:05,520
Donna fuan mo todokanai tokoro e

423
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,940
Hitori ja kanawanai yume wo egaitanara

424
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,940
一人 じゃ 叶わない 夢 を 描いたなら

425
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,940
If I wish for a dream that can't be reached on my own,

426
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:11,440
They made me help them.

427
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:16,200
With the two of us, we can make it come true.

428
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:16,200
君 と 二人 で 叶えに ゆくんだ

429
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:16,200
Kimi to futari de kanaeni yukunda

430
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:17,070
I created philosopher's stones and took the lives of many Ishbalans.

431
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,950
You and I are a pair; we can't achieve happiness without each other.

432
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,950
君 と 半分 一つ の 幸せ

433
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,950
Kimi to hanbun hitotsu no shiawase

434
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:23,950
And now, I'm on the verge of being forced to work on an experiment that would cause more deaths.

435
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,450
So...

436
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:28,330
So please, I'm begging you! Kill me!

437
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,710
Right here, right now!

438
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:32,960
I'm going to get back at them with death!

439
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:40,680
Right now, in my eyes, you appear as God...

440
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:48,350
You haven't told me everything about Ishbal yet!

441
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,270
What the hell did you bastards do there?!

442
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,900
Tell me everything, Marcoh!

443
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,940
Before my right hand destroys you!!!

444
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:01,700
Force. Never-ending violence.

445
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,290
The earth is drowned in blood.

446
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,290
The air is choked with the stench of burnt flesh.

447
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,460
Ishbal...

448
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,170
A detestable memory.

449
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,590
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

450
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:21,620
Episode 30, The Ishvalan War of Extermination.

451
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:21,620
The Ishvalan War
of Extermination

452
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,930
I will recite the truth.

453
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,970
Although I'm the only one left.
