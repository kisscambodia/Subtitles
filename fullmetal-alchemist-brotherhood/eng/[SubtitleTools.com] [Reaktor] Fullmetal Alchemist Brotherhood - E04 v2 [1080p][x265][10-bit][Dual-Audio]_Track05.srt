1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:06,350
Alchemy is a science where one understands the structure of matter, breaks it down, then rebuilds it.

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:11,980
However, it is not an all-powerful technique,
as one cannot create something out of nothing.

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,780
If one wishes to gain something,
one must present something of equal value.

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:22,490
This is the concept of equivalent exchange, the fundamental basis of alchemy.

5
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:27,120
However, there is a taboo in alchemy. Human transmutation.

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,450
One must not commit this act.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,970
I've still got a lot of years ahead of me

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,970
Kono omoi wo keshiteshimau niwa

9
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,880
To just erase these feelings?

10
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,970
Mada jinsei nagai desho?

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:35,930
To just erase these feelings?

12
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:35,970
To just erase these feelings?

13
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,970
I want to go back and finish

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,970
Yarinokoshiteru koto

15
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,600
The things that I've yet to finish.

16
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,600
Yarinaoshite mitai kara

17
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:58,870
I was supposed to be chasing after my ongoing dream,

18
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:58,870
Yume no tsuzuki oikaketeita hazu nanoni

19
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:05,210
Yet I faltered over others while walking this thin, winding path.

20
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:05,210
Magarikunetta hosoi michi hito ni tsumazuku

21
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,380
It's not that I want to return to those days.

22
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,380
Ano koro mitainitte modoritai wake ja nai no

23
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,880
I'm searching for the sky I lost.

24
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,880
Nakushitekita sora wo sagashiteru

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,550
Wakatte kuremasu youni

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,550
Don't make that sad face, as if you've fallen victim.

27
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:18,760
As if you want people to pity you.

28
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:18,760
Gisei ni natta youna kanashii kao wa yameteyo

29
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,470
Tears aren't the end of your sins.

30
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,470
Tsumi no saigo wa namida ja nai yo

31
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,140
You have to bear them painfully, forever.

32
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,140
Zutto kurushiku seottekunda

33
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,810
Who are you waiting for in the maze of emotions,

34
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,810
Deguchi mienai kanjoumeiro ni

35
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,480
Where you can't even see the exit?

36
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,480
Dare wo matteruno?

37
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,270
Shiroi nooto ni tsuzutta youni

38
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,270
I want to blurt it out more justly,

39
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,020
Just like how I wrote it in my white notebook.

40
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,020
Motto sunao ni hakidashitai yo

41
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,690
What do you want to run from?

42
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,690
Nani kara nogaretainda

43
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,320
That thing called "reality"?

44
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,320
Genjitsu tte yatsu?

45
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,650
I just want to scream out,

46
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,650
Kanaeru tame ni ikiterundatte

47
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,070
"I'm only living to fulfill my wish." Can you hear me?

48
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,070
Sakebitaku naru yo kikoeteimasuka?

49
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:43,200
I can't take the safe way out of everything.

50
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:43,200
Bunan ni nante yatterarenaikara

51
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't even have a place to return to.

52
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,000
Kaeru basho mo nai no

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,290
I'm always thankful for everyone's kindness,

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,290
Yasashisa ni wa itsumo kansha shiteru

55
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,670
That's why I want to become stronger. (I'm on the way)

56
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,670
Dakara tsuyoku naritai (I'm on the way)

57
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,630
This is reminding me of the old days.

58
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,630
Natsukashiku naru

59
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,880
This pain is all right with me.

60
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,880
Konna itami mo kangei jan

61
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:08,720
In the city of Lior, a High Priest of Leto deceived people through the use of the Philosopher's Stone and alchemy.

62
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,520
Ed and Al, who ventured into the church, stopped the High Priest's plot.

63
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,560
However, the Philosopher's Stone was a fake.

64
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,690
"Get up and take a step. Walk forward."

65
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,820
Ed's words pierced Rose's chest, who had lost all hope.

66
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,700
But, those words were also meant for themselves, as well.

67
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,110
An Alchemist's Anguish

68
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,710
You're Basque Gran, the "Iron Blood Alchemist", aren't you?

69
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,170
Who are you?

70
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,510
Alchemists who go against God's path...

71
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,510
...shall perish!

72
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,730
So you're the killer who only goes after State Alchemists.

73
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,480
But!

74
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,530
You picked... the wrong opponent!

75
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,290
You're fast! But...

76
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,840
Well, then...

77
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,630
How foolish.

78
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,770
W-What?!

79
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:42,650
Perish.

80
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,990
Another State Alchemist?

81
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,960
Looks like quite a mess.

82
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,250
You have to be careful, too, Major.

83
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,750
You may be his next target.

84
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,840
Yes, sir...

85
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,010
Führer President!

86
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,220
Why are you here, sir?

87
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,060
I heard the news.

88
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,520
Lt. Colonel Hughes, are you in charge of dealing with this matter?

89
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,190
Yes, sir!

90
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,570
If there are people whom you require assistance from, request them immediately.

91
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,570
We must bring the iron hammer down on the traitors.

92
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,780
Yes, sir!

93
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,580
Second Lieutenant Breda.

94
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,580
All right...

95
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,960
Seriously... The Colonel must have been procrastinating again.

96
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,420
Hey, Havoc, do half of these for me.

97
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,590
I've got my hands full over here, too.

98
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,260
Umm, who is this again?

99
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,590
That's Lieutenant Yoki.

100
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:59,850
He's a little rascal who was lining his pockets with the authority he was given at the coal mines of Youswell.

101
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:04,020
He's currently on the run after having
his actions exposed by the Elric Brothers.

102
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,900
Sergeant Fuery, how is the radio?

103
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,820
The receiver is broken.

104
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,400
We'll need to replace some parts...

105
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,280
Edward-kun! Alphonse-kun!

106
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,330
Welcome back, you two.

107
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,040
The Colonel has been waiting for you.

108
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,170
The matter in Lior is settled all thanks to you.

109
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,630
I'd like to express my gratitude.

110
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,300
It wasn't for you or anything.

111
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,880
And, was the search for
the Philosopher's Stone a failure again?

112
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,930
The stone was a fake.

113
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,310
But the power was unbelievable.

114
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,480
He transmuted a huge chimera, too.

115
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,440
I wonder how you could use the stone to make something like that?

116
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,530
I'm not really familiar with the field of
Biological Alchemy, so I wouldn't know, but...

117
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,820
Yeah, I'm a little curious.

118
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:00,330
If we put our effort into researching it,
we may find something useful in getting our bodies back.

119
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,030
Yeah.

120
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,000
Then, how about seeking help from a specialist?

121
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,870
Huh?

122
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,830
The Sewing-Life Alchemist, Shou Tucker.

123
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,040
He is a scholar in chimera Transmutation.

124
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,130
I'll introduce you to him.

125
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,170
You're going to go out of your way to do that?

126
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,090
I-It's a trap! There's definitely more than meets the eye!

127
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,930
Don't look at me with those suspicious eyes!

128
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,310
We're even after that case in Lior!

129
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,060
It just feels disgusting to know that I owe you.

130
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:32,820
Tucker became a State Alchemist two years ago after transmuting a chimera that understood human language.

131
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,530
"Understood human language"?

132
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,110
It could speak?! The chimera?!

133
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,570
Yeah. Apparently, it did.

134
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,580
Just one sentence...

135
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,830
"I want to die."

136
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,620
It never ate afterwards and died.

137
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,470
What a huge house.

138
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,800
B-Brother!

139
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,890
Wow, we've got a lot of visitors!

140
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:10,560
Nina, we have to keep the dog tied down.

141
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,530
I'm terribly sorry.

142
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:19,150
This house has been in a mess ever since my wife left.

143
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,580
Well, pleasure to meet you, Edward.

144
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,710
I'm Shou Tucker, the Sewing-Life Alchemist.

145
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,380
He is interested in the transmutation of living organisms.

146
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,760
He said he would love to have
the honor of seeing your work.

147
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,880
Sure, that's fine with me.

148
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,140
One thing, though...

149
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,180
If you'd like for me to show you my hand,

150
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,060
I'm going to need to see yours, too.

151
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,060
Isn't that what being an alchemist is about?

152
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,440
Why are you interested in the transmutation of the living organisms, exactly?

153
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,320
Oh, well... he's...

154
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,240
Colonel.

155
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,280
Transmutation of your mother?!

156
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,790
As an eleven year old child?!

157
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,330
Ah, I see. So that's why you're called "The Fullmetal Alchemist"...

158
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,800
You've experienced a tough past, haven't you...

159
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,800
I'm not sure whether I could be of any help at all,

160
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,140
but please take a look at my laboratory.

161
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:33,980
Wow...

162
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,110
Ah, this is a little embarrassing.

163
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:43,740
People call me the "authority" on chimeras, but in reality, it's not really going very well.

164
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,870
Wow, this is awesome!

165
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,290
That's the reference room. Feel free to take a look around.

166
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,290
All right. Then I'll start with this shelf.

167
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,330
Then I'll start with that one over there.

168
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,710
I'll be returning to work.

169
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,050
I'll send someone to pick them up in the evening.

170
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,640
Wow, he's really into it.

171
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,060
He can't even hear what's going on around him.

172
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,980
I guess geniuses really do exist.

173
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,760
Up high! Up high!

174
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,090
Al, what the heck are you doing?!

175
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,890
Nina seemed like she wanted someone to play with her.

176
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,100
Hey, what the heck do you think we're here for-

177
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:01,070
Alexander wants someone to play with, too, he says.

178
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,280
You've got some guts.

179
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,570
It's said that even when hunting rabbits, lions put forth their fullest effort.

180
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:14,200
I, Edward Elric, shall deal with you with all of my physical and spiritual might!!!

181
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,580
You damn dog!!!

182
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,170
Yo Boss, I've come to pick you up.

183
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,630
What are you doing?

184
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:30,640
Eh, just taking a break from research...

185
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,560
Did you manage to get good data?

186
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,480
You're welcome to visit tomorrow, too.

187
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,690
You'll come visit again?

188
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,610
Let's play tomorrow, all right, Nina?

189
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,270
Okay!

190
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,530
Oh right, Mr. Tucker, I've got a message for you from the Colonel.

191
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:51,530
He told me to tell you, "It's almost the day of the assessment. Don't forget."

192
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,790
Yes, understood.

193
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Well, then.

194
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,250
Daddy.

195
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,800
What's an "assessment"?

196
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,010
Well...

197
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:15,220
A State Alchemist has to report the results of his experiments once a year.

198
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,810
Daddy couldn't get a good evaluation last year.

199
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:25,360
If Daddy messes up this year,
Daddy won't be a State Alchemist anymore.

200
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,740
What?!

201
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,950
You'll be fine, Daddy!

202
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,280
You're always studying so much!

203
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,700
You're right. I've got to do my best.

204
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,330
This... is my last chance...

205
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,050
Huh, your mother left home two years ago?

206
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,720
Daddy told me that she went back to her parents' home.

207
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:01,060
Oh... it must be kind of lonely for you,
being alone with your daddy in a big house like this.

208
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,060
Nope, I'm fine.

209
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,980
Daddy's really nice, and I've got Alexander with me, too.

210
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:12,990
But... Daddy's always at his lab these days, so..

211
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,080
I guess I'm kind of lonely...

212
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,290
Ugh, my shoulders have gotten a little stiff.

213
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,630
Why don't you exercise a bit, Brother?

214
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,880
That sounds kind of nice.

215
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,470
Hey, dog!

216
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,680
Accompany me on my exercises!

217
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,350
You, too, Nina.

218
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,100
Wait up!

219
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,560
Watch this!

220
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,690
Hey, hey, hey!

221
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,360
Wait, you!

222
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,870
Wait!

223
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,170
You can do it, Alexander!

224
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:09,420
"It's almost the day of the assessment. Don't forget."

225
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,810
But... why does he only target State Alchemists?

226
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:25,810
If the army is his target, he can just attack soldiers indiscriminately.

227
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,320
Since Alchemists possess special abilities, they're not easy to kill.

228
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,570
And one with a state qualification should be much tougher.

229
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,530
Perhaps it's the qualification that's the reason?

230
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,200
Hm?

231
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,410
An immense reward and various privileges.

232
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,080
Many are envious of them.

233
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,830
Also...

234
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:48,590
"Alchemists, work for the good of the public."

235
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,880
Alchemists, who are supposed to be searching for the truth,

236
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,010
turn into the army's human weapons
as soon as they earn their state qualifications.

237
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,470
And also, after that civil war in Ishbal,

238
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:02,560
there are many who hold a grudge against us.

239
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,020
Reporting.

240
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:16,740
Yesterday, around 9:30PM, many station employees witnessed a man with a large scar on his face at Central City Station.

241
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,360
Station?!

242
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,070
Did he run away?!

243
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:27,080
Our lives before I got my state qualification were terrible.

244
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,330
We were so poor.

245
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,380
My wife couldn't stand living in conditions like that, and she left our home.

246
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,050
I need to pass the assessment, no matter what...

247
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,220
I don't ever want to return to those days.

248
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,180
It's okay, Daddy!

249
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:51,020
If they tell you "No", Alexander and I will go and scold the higher-ups!

250
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,280
Nina sure is strong.

251
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,360
Nina... what do you say we play together tomorrow?

252
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,950
Really?!

253
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,120
Yeah.

254
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,530
Yay!

255
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,250
Alexander, Daddy said he'd play with us tomorrow!

256
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,010
Good morning, Mr. Tucker!

257
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,930
We're going to be using your place again today!

258
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,600
Huh?

259
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,980
Mr. Tucker?

260
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,020
Hey! Nina?

261
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,900
Mr. Tucker?

262
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,940
Oh, so you are here.

263
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,650
Hey...

264
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,860
It's complete. The finished product.

265
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,490
A chimera that understands human language.

266
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,200
Watch.

267
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,250
This person is Edward. Got it?

268
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,250
Ed...ward...

269
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,880
That's right! I'm so proud of you!

270
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,630
This is amazing... it really did talk.

271
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,510
Now I won't have to lose my state qualification.

272
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,430
Ed...ward...

273
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,690
Ed...ward...

274
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,270
Ed...ward...

275
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,860
O...nii...chan...

276
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,580
Mr. Tucker...

277
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,830
When did you get your state qualification again?

278
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:36,090
It was two years ago, I believe.

279
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,590
And when did your wife leave you?

280
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,840
Two years ago.

281
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,640
Can I ask you another question?

282
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,100
Nina and Alexander...

283
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,560
Where are they?!

284
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,060
I don't like sharp brats like you.

285
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,070
Brother!

286
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:00,860
Yeah, that's how it is!

287
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,280
You've done it, haven't you?!

288
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,780
It was your wife two years ago,

289
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:09,290
and this time, you used your daughter and your dog to transmute a chimera!

290
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:13,040
Since there are limits to animal experimentation, after all!

291
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,750
It must be a breeze if you use a human!!!

292
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,750
W-What's there to get angry about?

293
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:24,550
The mankind's advances are the product of many experiments on humans, aren't they?

294
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,220
If you're a scientist, too, then you should-

295
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,300
Don't screw around with me!!!

296
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,060
Do you really think something like this will be forgiven?!

297
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:34,560
Something like this... toying with human life?!

298
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,650
Human life?

299
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:39,570
Ah, human life, you say?

300
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,730
Fullmetal Alchemist!

301
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:45,110
Your limbs and your younger brother.

302
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:49,830
Aren't those the results of what you're saying right now? Toying with human life?

303
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,830
NO!!!

304
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,960
We're the same!

305
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,830
You and I!

306
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,840
No, we're not!!!

307
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,460
Yes, we are!

308
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,630
There was a possibility in front of us, so we tested it out.

309
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,220
Even though we knew it was taboo!

310
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,510
You're wrong!!!

311
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,260
I!

312
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,970
Alchemists!

313
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,020
Don't!

314
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,400
I... I!!!

315
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,190
Brother!

316
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,820
If you go any further, he'll die!

317
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,500
Da...ddy...

318
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,710
Does it hurt?

319
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,000
Da...ddy...

320
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,500
Does it hurt?

321
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,760
I'm sorry.

322
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:52,680
We can't change you back to normal with our powers.

323
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,020
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

324
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,310
Let's... play.

325
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,020
Let's play...

326
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,940
I made it in time.

327
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,030
With this, I can continue being a State Alchemist...

328
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,380
State Alchemist, my ass...

329
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,880
Stop kidding yourself...

330
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,840
Let's... play.

331
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,090
DAMMIT!!!

332
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:38,680
If something such as an act of the Devil exists in this world,

333
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,600
this case is just that.

334
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,860
The Devil, huh...

335
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:51,320
But if it is an order, State Alchemists must make
their move, without hesitation, to take human lives.

336
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,990
If it's about handling human lives,

337
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:57,700
there really isn't much difference between where we stand and what Mr. Tucker did.

338
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:02,880
You were aware of that, and yet you chose this path.

339
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,630
Am I right, Fullmetal?

340
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,060
I'm sure you'll run into incidents like this in the future again.

341
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,770
There may be times when you have to soil your hands.

342
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,110
Are you going to come to a stop like that every time it happens?

343
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,440
Whether they call me a dog of the military, or curse me as a devil,

344
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,530
Al and I will get back our bodies.

345
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,320
But...

346
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,910
We're neither devils,

347
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,540
nor gods at that!

348
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,660
We're humans...

349
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,340
We're just humans!!!

350
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,680
Puny, powerless humans...

351
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,970
...who can't even save one little girl.

352
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,060
I wonder why no one understands us...

353
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:03,690
...Nina...

354
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,860
You're Shou Tucker, aren't you?

355
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,070
Who are you?

356
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:17,490
Looks like... you're not from the military!

357
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,410
How did you get in?!

358
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,540
There should have been military policemen stationed out front!

359
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,420
Alchemists, who go against God's path...

360
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,460
...shall perish!

361
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,810
Da...ddy...

362
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,480
Da...ddy...

363
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,810
Daddy...

364
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,360
How miserable...

365
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,320
But now that you are in a state like that,
there is no way to return you to normal.

366
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,820
At the very least, leave this world in peace.

367
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,700
God,

368
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:09,090
two souls have just returned to your side.

369
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:17,220
Please usher them into your broad bosom,
and grant rest and salvation to their miserable souls.

370
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:33,030
Say, the sky we saw that day, the scarlet sky.

371
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:33,030
Ano hi mita sora akaneiro no sora wo

372
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:38,240
Do you remember it from that day?

373
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:38,240
Nee kimi wa oboeteimasuka

374
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,160
We made a promise and a vow while the early summer wind circled us.

375
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,160
Yakusoku chigiri shoka no kaze ga tsutsumu

376
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,420
And we clung close together.

377
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,420
Futari yorisotta

378
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,470
Your forced smile

379
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,470
Muri na egao no ura

380
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:02,850
Nobita kage wo kakumau

381
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:02,850
Holds elongated shadows.

382
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:12,110
I pretend not to notice and continue on.

383
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:12,110
Dakara kizukanu furi saisei wo erabu

384
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:21,620
All the while waiting for you to deliver some news at the table.

385
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:21,620
Teeburu no ue no furuenai shirase machitsuzukete

386
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:30,000
Empty nights, mornings that will never arrive,

387
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:30,000
Kuuhaku no yoru mo kuru hazu no nai asa mo

388
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,750
I could see them from a mile away.

389
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,750
Zenbu wakattetanda

390
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:40,380
Say, the sky we saw that day, the scarlet sky.

391
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:40,380
Ano hi mita sora akaneiro no sora wo

392
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:45,310
Nee itsuka omoidasu deshou

393
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:45,310
I'm sure you'll remember it one day.

394
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:51,150
While holding the promise we couldn't keep,

395
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:51,150
Hatasenakatta yakusoku wo idaite

396
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:55,400
We take our first steps down our own paths.

397
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:55,400
Futari arukidasu

398
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,770
The rain pours down in East City.

399
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,510
Still grief-stricken over Nina's death,

400
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:08,050
Ed and Al are attacked by the mysterious man, Scar.

401
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:12,560
In a life-or-death crisis, Ed makes a desperate decision.

402
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:17,860
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

403
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,440
Episode 5, Rain of Sorrows.

404
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:20,870
Rain of Sorrows

405
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:26,650
Will he be ready to accept the decision brought on by desperation?
