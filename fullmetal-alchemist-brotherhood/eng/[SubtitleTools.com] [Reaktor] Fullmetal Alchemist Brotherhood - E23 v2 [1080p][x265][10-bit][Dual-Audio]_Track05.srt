1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:06,190
Drawn by a landscape as white as snow,

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:06,190
Masshiro na keshiki ni ima sasowarete

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,740
I'm headed toward an unseen world.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,740
Boku wa yuku yo mada minu sekai e

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,680
I've been traveling while lost

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,680
Maigo no mama tabi shiteita

7
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,470
Under this gray sky.

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,460
Nezumiiro no sora no shita

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,560
Every day with new maps, stained with my many dreams.

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,560
Higawari no chizu ikutsumo no yume ga nijindeita

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,950
I wonder if someday,

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,950
Itsuka wa sa

13
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,990
Even with these tiny steps of mine,

14
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,990
Chippoke na boku no kono hohaba demo

15
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:43,070
I'll be able to travel beyond those clouds.

16
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:43,070
Ano kumo no mukou made yukeru kana

17
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,700
I put on a bold front.

18
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,700
Tsuyogatte

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,250
End up hurting myself.

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,250
Kizutsuita

21
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,330
I feel empty inside.

22
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,330
Kokoro sukashita youni

23
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,870
It's started to rain,

24
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,870
Furidashita

25
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,040
And the raindrops

26
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,040
Amatsubu tachi ga

27
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,260
Began to repeat their scattered reflections.

28
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,260
Ranhansha kurikaesu

29
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,130
These straight rays of light

30
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,130
Massugu na hikari ga

31
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,850
Start to cross one another.

32
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,850
Kousa shite

33
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,430
And without telling anyone where they're headed,

34
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,430
Yakusaki mo tsugenumama

35
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,720
Across the endless distances,

36
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,720
Doko made mo

37
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,310
They pass through all matter.

38
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,310
Tsukinukeru

39
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:14,140
I burn these faint afterimages onto my eyes.

40
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:14,140
Awai zanzou ryoume ni yakitsukete

41
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,060
Under this sky,

42
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,060
Kono sora no shita

43
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,890
Wherever I am,

44
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,890
Donna toko ni itemo

45
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,190
I should be able to reach

46
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,190
Todoku hazu nanda

47
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:27,000
The unseen world.

48
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:27,000
Mada minu sekai e

49
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,010
Girl on the Battlefield

50
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,080
A smoke bomb and a grenade.

51
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,070
That brat sure is reckless.

52
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,220
Can you track them by scent?

53
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:53,660
Yeah.

54
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,760
Hey, MP.

55
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,700
Please take her somewhere safe.

56
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:12,180
Winry, Al's still fighting, so...

57
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,430
I'm going to go.

58
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,260
Sorry.

59
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,440
I'll tell you everything when I get back.

60
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,140
How come... all I can ever do is wait?

61
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,660
We've taken a girl under protection at 8th District, San Louis Street.

62
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,190
Apparently, she's a close friend of the Fullmetal Alchemist.

63
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,120
Escort her to Central Headquarters.

64
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,830
I repeat.

65
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,770
We've taken a girl under protection at 8th District, San Louis Street.

66
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,610
Apparently, she's a close friend of the Fullmetal Alchemist.

67
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,300
I guess it's about time.

68
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,330
Escort her to Central Headquarters.

69
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,550
Go provide them support.

70
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,270
Roger.

71
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,180
There's a vacant house on the outskirts of town we can use.

72
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,060
Let's meet up here.

73
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,720
Make sure no one follows you.

74
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,440
Yes, sir.

75
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,310
I'll contact you if we make progress.

76
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:08,170
All right.

77
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,010
You can't come to the scene.

78
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,330
I know, I know...

79
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,250
So persistent!

80
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,140
I'm being driven into a part of town without anyone around...

81
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,770
Did I fall for their trap?!

82
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,360
Was that Scar?

83
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,620
You take care of the other one.

84
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,550
I'll put an end to those two.

85
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,260
My left arm is...

86
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,370
What's wrong?!

87
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,290
Young master!

88
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,960
I can no longer be of any use to you!

89
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,210
What are you saying?!

90
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:08,820
If you take me with you, you may fall victim, as well...

91
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,010
Without his people, there is no King.

92
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,130
But without their King, the people have no place to go.

93
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,570
You must survive, for the sake of our clan...

94
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,360
I won't leave you!

95
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,490
There are plenty of things worth throwing away for a great cause.

96
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,490
Lan Fan?! What are you planning?!

97
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,370
Don't do it!

98
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,090
There's nothing inside your armor, right?

99
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,900
How pitiful!

100
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,850
You continue to believe in alchemy
even after being placed in that miserable state?!

101
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,220
This body comes with many inconveniences.

102
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,400
But inconveniences don't make me miserable!

103
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,660
There's no reason for you to pity me!

104
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,000
My life was put back together with alchemy by my brother.

105
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:23,910
If I deny myself, that would mean
I'm denying brother, along with alchemy.

106
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,750
I believe in the potential alchemy holds.

107
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,310
I want to believe in it!

108
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,770
I see.

109
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,890
Brother!

110
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,080
What about Winry?

111
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,900
She's fine.

112
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,020
I'm such an idiot.

113
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,690
I made her cry again.

114
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,530
You're always so careless.

115
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,850
She saw us all covered in blood, too.

116
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,130
Yeah.

117
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,290
All right, time for act two!

118
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,280
Found you!!!

119
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,880
The Ishbalan!

120
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,490
You're...

121
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,250
That tattoo!

122
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,300
A Homunculus!

123
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,210
Lin!

124
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,280
Run!

125
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,110
Get me a sturdy wire!

126
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,150
R-Right!

127
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:21,710
The fact your regeneration ability is so powerful became your downfall!

128
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,780
Your own meat that expands from within the wire will end up binding you tighter!

129
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,150
Got you, Homunculus!

130
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,350
Well played.

131
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:59,200
I outwitted you, monster!

132
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,720
What? A Homunculus?

133
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,030
Get him on!

134
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:13,750
We're making a run for it!

135
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,180
Hey, wait a minute Lieute-

136
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,420
H-Hang on!

137
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,700
Al!

138
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,160
The military police are watching.

139
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,530
Pretend like you don't know them.

140
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,010
They ran!

141
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,250
Capture Scar!

142
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:42,760
Yes, sir!

143
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,050
The Colonel isn't the nicest guy around, but he's trustworthy.

144
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,990
But more importantly...

145
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,420
We need to capture Scar, Al!

146
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,130
Right!

147
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,390
Multiple crimes, including the murder of the Rockbells!

148
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,560
You'll pay for those crimes!

149
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,610
Are you all right, Mister Servant?

150
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,900
How dare you do something like this to the servant of my savior, Yoki!

151
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,860
You pipsqueak!

152
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,990
What did you say?! Speak for yourself!

153
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,980
Who is that child?!

154
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,820
Little girl, get away from him!

155
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,000
It's dangerous!

156
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,820
We're far outnumbered...

157
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,870
We ought to retreat!

158
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,520
Just what the hell was that alchemy?!

159
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,820
She performed transmutations from a distance?!

160
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,150
This way.

161
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,820
Dammit, I can't see a thing!

162
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,020
Scar!!!

163
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,190
I've already heard about you, Lin Yao.

164
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,720
We're heading straight to our hideout.

165
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,720
Wait! I left a comrade. Pick her up for me!

166
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,320
Huh?

167
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,610
No, we don't have time!

168
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,330
I'm begging you! She's in critical condition!

169
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,160
She's waiting for me to come and get her!

170
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,350
Make it quick.

171
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,780
If I recall, that woman is Mustang's...

172
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,590
You've gone and done it now, youngster.

173
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,390
So even I had those eyes...

174
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:17,480
No matter how far along we've come,
hatred only brings about more hatred...

175
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,940
That should have stopped the bleeding.

176
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,570
Thanks.

177
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,360
Master!

178
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,200
The military police are just around the corner!

179
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,410
We should run...

180
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,200
Our target is injured!

181
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,210
He couldn't have gotten far!

182
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,000
Search thoroughly!

183
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,420
Yes, sir!

184
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,250
Master!

185
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,290
Hurry! Hurry!

186
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,300
Shao May, we have to-

187
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,220
Huh?

188
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,930
I found something.

189
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,560
You! Is this really the time to be picking stuff up?!

190
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,810
But it was all alone in the midst of that!

191
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,860
You always do this!

192
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,820
You once picked up a stray cat and raised it inside your armor without telling me!

193
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,570
Get rid of that thing!

194
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,240
You're horrible!

195
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,780
Look how tame it is!

196
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,740
It's okay. Relax.

197
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,260
Please. This way.

198
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,340
Thanks.

199
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,300
Stay inside, okay?

200
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:43,730
Winry!

201
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,530
How's it going, Fullmetal Alchemist?

202
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,820
Führer President Bradley.

203
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,030
Why are you...

204
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,040
I heard your childhood friend was under guard here.

205
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,210
She's a person close to one of my valued, talented alchemists.

206
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,460
I have to treat her courteously.

207
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:10,550
Well then, young lady, I'll be taking my leave.

208
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,720
Okay. Thanks for everything.

209
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,310
She's a good, honest girl.

210
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,100
Treat her with care, okay?

211
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,530
Ed.

212
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,610
You promised.

213
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,240
Tell me everything you know about Mom and Dad.

214
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,880
I see...

215
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,510
So they were doing their best to help people until the very end...

216
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:57,680
But...

217
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,100
...I still wish they could have come back alive...

218
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,440
All I can do... is wait.

219
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,370
Oh, perfect timing!

220
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,250
There's a call for Miss Rockbell.

221
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,920
For me?

222
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,010
Hello?

223
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,300
Mr. Garfield?

224
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,260
Sorry, Winry.

225
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,310
I was hoping to take care of everything myself, but...

226
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,850
Is Winry still not back?!

227
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,600
Look at this! Only Winry can fix this!

228
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:50,320
Your customers really miss you!

229
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:53,150
Please come back soon, Winry!

230
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,110
Winry?

231
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,450
Tetsu?

232
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,280
Please, come back soon!

233
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,500
My foot feels so much better when you operate on it rather than Mr. Garfield!

234
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:09,380
Winry, I need you to finish off the exterior for my leg as soon as possible!

235
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,380
My arm, too!

236
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,590
No, I'm first!

237
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,000
I want to see you soon!

238
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,010
You idiot, Winry belongs to everybody!

239
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,300
That's right!

240
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:21,100
Sorry... I'll be back soon.

241
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,060
Please wait for me.

242
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,190
I'll do... I'll do my best...

243
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,520
Thanks.

244
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,120
Thanks for stopping me back then.

245
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,660
There are people who are waiting for me.

246
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,420
I was close to doing something that would make me unable to face them.

247
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,710
Winry...

248
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:58,550
Ed, don't forget to maintain your automail!

249
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,720
Y-You got it!

250
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,850
I'll send you some good polishing oil sometime, Al.

251
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:03,600
Okay!

252
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,850
Please don't die.

253
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,190
We won't.

254
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,190
Got it.

255
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,360
Next time I make you-

256
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,940
Huh? What?

257
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,950
I can't hear you.

258
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,660
Brother?

259
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,620
Wait!

260
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,370
Bye, Winry.

261
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,450
O-Okay.

262
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,370
Geez...

263
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,210
Hey, Ed!

264
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,170
What did you say?!

265
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,720
Next time I make you cry, it'll be with tears of joy!

266
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:44,550
Al and I will get our bodies back for sure, and we'll make you cry tears of joy!

267
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,680
You'd better remember!

268
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,610
Give me an arm and a leg.

269
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,160
One year.

270
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,830
We have no place to return now.

271
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,370
Why are you  crying?

272
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,190
Oh, I get it...

273
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,320
I... fell in love with him...

274
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,240
Colonel!

275
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,530
Get in.

276
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,130
There's someone seriously wounded.

277
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:59,710
We need a doctor.

278
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,590
Doing dangerous things again?

279
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,260
You stupid brat.

280
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,390
If I recall, you have family.

281
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:10,140
If it'll cause trouble, you don't have to do it.

282
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,770
I'll go bring some instruments, so hang tight.

283
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,350
Is it okay?

284
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:21,190
I divorced my wife soon after I came back from Ishbal.

285
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,660
You walked in the sewers with your arm cut off?!

286
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,490
I wouldn't be surprised if you got tetanus!

287
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:35,370
I've only dealt with corpses lately.

288
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,130
So I may be a bit rough.

289
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,050
I'm sorry...

290
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,260
Don't get the wrong idea.

291
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,050
We're the ones who offered to help.

292
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,430
We only worked with you guys because we had a common interest.

293
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,310
I'm seeking something so great as immortality.

294
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:59,270
I was prepared for the worst when I left my country.

295
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:06,070
No... I wasn't prepared enough.

296
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:11,580
Lan Fan was more prepared than I was.

297
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,880
Are you all right?

298
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,300
Is there anything we can do for you?

299
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,800
Your trap wasn't half bad...

300
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,390
But I can't use it anymore...

301
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,310
I need a replacement arm.

302
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:38,980
Sure!

303
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,560
I'll introduce you to an awesome automail mechanic!

304
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,780
I'm Colonel Roy Mustang of the military.

305
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:58,540
I'm Lin Yao, twelfth prince of the Xing Dynasty.

306
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,170
I'm grateful that you found us a doctor.

307
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:05,000
You helped us out by helping Maria Ross, as well.

308
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,670
And this thing, too.

309
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,350
Hey, what the hell is that?

310
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,890
He's a homunculus by the name of Gluttony.

311
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,140
Ho-

312
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,480
Apparently, this guy has some sort of connection with a portion of the upper echelons of the military.

313
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,740
"A portion"?!

314
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,990
You have no idea!

315
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,120
King Bradley.

316
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:34,660
There's a possibility he's a Homunculus, as well.

317
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,620
He had a tattoo of Ouroboros on his eye underneath his eyepatch.

318
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:44,250
He and Gluttony both came after us.

319
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,290
No way...

320
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,800
The top man of the country is a Homunculus?!

321
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,050
But...

322
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:54,390
...Bradley did not give off a sense of not being a human, like Gluttony did.

323
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,310
He feels the same as an ordinary human.

324
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,020
Then...

325
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:03,730
First of all, if the Führer President is a Homunculus, what about his son?!

326
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:07,230
I read in a book that Homunculi are unable to reproduce!

327
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:07,440
No.

328
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,240
His son, Selim, was adopted.

329
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,280
He doesn't carry the blood of the Führer President.

330
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,500
A monster or a human...

331
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:24,330
Whichever it may be, now it's easier to drag him out of his position.

332
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,380
We'll get information out of this guy, first.

333
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,380
Let's take his philosopher's stone, too.

334
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,670
I may be able to use it to heal my man.

335
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,380
Hey, hey, hey!

336
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,340
Lan Fan lost her arm to obtain that!

337
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,680
We're taking that back to Xing!

338
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,690
Hang on! We've been searching for a way to get our bodies back for a long time, too!

339
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,190
I won't allow you to take it for yourself!

340
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:45,860
That's right.

341
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,020
Lin, you're an illegal immigrant.

342
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,070
I can't stand this!

343
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,990
Mustang, I'm going home.

344
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,530
Mustang...

345
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:01,660
Colonel Mustang... who killed Lust!

346
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,170
Roy Mustang!!!

347
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,190
What...

348
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:37,380
I don't have to act tough, right?

349
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:37,380
Tsuyogaranakute iindane

350
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:44,180
Dareka ga kaitetta

351
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:44,180
The scribbling someone made...

352
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:49,980
On the wall, of a flower is swaying.

353
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:49,980
Kabe no rakugaki no hana ga yureru

354
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,560
No one knows their true selves.

355
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,560
Jibunrashisa nante dermo wakaranaiyo

356
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,860
Even though we both lose and gain

357
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,860
Nagai nagai michi no tochuu de

358
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,280
By embarking on this long, long path,

359
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,280
Nakushitari hirottari

360
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:08,950
And though there may be days loneliness strikes and makes us weep...

361
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:08,950
Kyuu ni samishikunatte naichau hi mo arukedo

362
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:16,460
Namida mo itami mo hoshi ni kaeyou

363
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:16,460
Let's transform our tears and pains to stars.

364
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:22,460
Let's light a candle to illuminate our tomorrow.

365
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:22,460
Ashita wo terasu akari wo tomosou

366
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,590
And we'll hold our small hands over the fire to create stardust,

367
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,590
Chiisana te kazashite futari de tsukurou

368
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:32,810
And an eternity that shines so brilliantly.

369
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:32,810
Hoshikuzu wo tsuyoku hikaru eien wo

370
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:38,190
Farewells may be unavoidable,

371
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:38,190
Sayonara itsuka wa kurukamoshirenai

372
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:44,110
Yet the seasons continue to change obliviously.

373
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:44,110
Kisetsu wa soredemo meguri megutteku

374
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,200
Chiisaku mayottemo aruiteku

375
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,200
Even if I lose myself, I'll continue to walk...

376
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,240
Walk by your side.

377
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,240
Kimi to aruiteku

378
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,540
That's the only thing I'd like to never change.

379
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,540
Sore dake wa kawaranaideiyoune

380
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:04,480
What is hidden behind the smile of goodwill and kindness?

381
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,640
One must be discreet in order to dig further.

382
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,110
They move forward and run about, not knowing what to do.

383
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:16,490
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

384
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:20,250
Inside the Belly

385
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:20,250
Episode 24, Inside the Belly.

386
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:26,000
If you leap in carelessly, all that awaits is a sea of darkness.
