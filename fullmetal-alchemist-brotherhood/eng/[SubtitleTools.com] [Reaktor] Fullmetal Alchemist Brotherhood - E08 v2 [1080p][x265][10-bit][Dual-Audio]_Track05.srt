00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,870
Alchemy is a science where one understands the structure of matter, breaks it down, then rebuilds it.

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:11,460
However, it is not an all-powerful technique,
as one cannot create something out of nothing.

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:17,590
If one wishes to gain something,
one must present something of equal value.

4
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:22,010
This is the concept of equivalent exchange, the fundamental basis of alchemy.

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,640
However, there is a taboo in alchemy. Human transmutation.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,350
One must not commit this act.

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,950
I've still got a lot of years ahead of me

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,950
Kono omoi wo keshiteshimau niwa

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,860
To just erase these feelings?

10
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,950
Mada jinsei nagai desho?

11
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:35,910
To just erase these feelings?

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:35,950
To just erase these feelings?

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,950
I want to go back and finish

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,950
Yarinokoshiteru koto

15
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,580
The things that I've yet to finish.

16
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,580
Yarinaoshite mitai kara

17
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:58,850
I was supposed to be chasing after my ongoing dream,

18
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:58,850
Yume no tsuzuki oikaketeita hazu nanoni

19
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:05,190
Yet I faltered over others while walking this thin, winding path.

20
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:05,190
Magarikunetta hosoi michi hito ni tsumazuku

21
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,360
It's not that I want to return to those days.

22
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,360
Ano koro mitainitte modoritai wake ja nai no

23
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,860
I'm searching for the sky I lost.

24
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,860
Nakushitekita sora wo sagashiteru

25
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,530
Wakatte kuremasu youni

26
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,530
Don't make that sad face, as if you've fallen victim.

27
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,740
As if you want people to pity you.

28
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,740
Gisei ni natta youna kanashii kao wa yameteyo

29
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,450
Tears aren't the end of your sins.

30
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,450
Tsumi no saigo wa namida ja nai yo

31
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,120
You have to bear them painfully, forever.

32
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,120
Zutto kurushiku seottekunda

33
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,790
Who are you waiting for in the maze of emotions,

34
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,790
Deguchi mienai kanjoumeiro ni

35
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,460
Where you can't even see the exit?

36
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,460
Dare wo matteruno?

37
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,250
Shiroi nooto ni tsuzutta youni

38
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,250
I want to blurt it out more justly,

39
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,000
Just like how I wrote it in my white notebook.

40
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,000
Motto sunao ni hakidashitai yo

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,670
What do you want to run from?

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,670
Nani kara nogaretainda

43
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,300
That thing called "reality"?

44
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,300
Genjitsu tte yatsu?

45
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,630
I just want to scream out,

46
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,630
Kanaeru tame ni ikiterundatte

47
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,050
"I'm only living to fulfill my wish." Can you hear me?

48
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,050
Sakebitaku naru yo kikoeteimasuka?

49
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:43,180
I can't take the safe way out of everything.

50
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:43,180
Bunan ni nante yatterarenaikara

51
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,980
Kaeru basho mo nai no

52
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,980
I don't even have a place to return to.

53
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,270
I'm always thankful for everyone's kindness,

54
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,270
Yasashisa ni wa itsumo kansha shiteru

55
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,650
That's why I want to become stronger. (I'm on the way)

56
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,650
Dakara tsuyoku naritai (I'm on the way)

57
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,610
This is reminding me of the old days.

58
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,610
Natsukashiku naru

59
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,860
This pain is all right with me.

60
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,860
Konna itami mo kangei jan

61
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:08,240
The First Branch of the National Central Library, where Marcoh's research data was kept, was burned down.

62
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:15,960
Ed and Al obtain the research data with the help of Sheska, a former librarian. However...

63
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,420
The ingredients of philosopher's stones...

64
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,170
...are live humans.

65
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:28,050
Seeking more of the truth, Ed and Al sneak into the abandoned Research Laboratory 5.

66
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,020
The Fifth Laboratory

67
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,110
You're pretty fast for a guy so big.

68
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,360
Else it wouldn't be fun for me!

69
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,570
Who are you?!

70
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,240
I'm Number 66.

71
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,200
That's just my work name, though.

72
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,620
I'll dismantle you neatly,

73
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,920
so go ahead and wail!

74
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,180
What the heck is this?

75
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,270
Could it be what's used to transmute philosopher's stones?

76
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,770
Precisely.

77
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,570
I don't know who you are, but I'm amazed you figured
that out by just looking at the transmutation circle, boy.

78
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,860
Who are you, old man?

79
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,990
My duty is to guard this area.

80
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,740
I suppose I'll introduce myself as Number 48.

81
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,160
And I'm not an old man, either.

82
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:45,380
I've been instructed to eliminate any outsiders who have infiltrated the building.

83
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,460
Don't think badly of me, boy.

84
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,800
Same goes for you...

85
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,050
Don't take it too badly when you get beaten by a boy.

86
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,890
An alchemist, huh?

87
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,730
Let's see how good you are.

88
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,070
Looks like that arm saved your life!

89
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:10,400
But my beloved sword even slices through steel!

90
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,370
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

91
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:26,500
Do you not have a body in there?

92
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,210
I'm amazed you noticed.

93
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,590
I spar with someone like you all the time.

94
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:36,180
Ah, so there's someone in this state in the outside world, too, eh?

95
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,140
I don't like this at all.

96
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:44,980
That there's some idiot other than me who'd come up with the idea of affixing a soul to a suit of armor.

97
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,730
Let me introduce myself again.

98
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,990
48 was my death row number.

99
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:59,490
When I still had my body, I was called Slicer the Homicide.

100
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,250
Death row. Just as I thought.

101
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:08,460
Hey, this place makes philosopher's stones out of criminals on death row, right?

102
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,550
That I cannot answer.

103
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:17,140
I was simply hired for my skills, given this body,
and stationed here as a watchdog.

104
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:22,350
Which means there's a seal somewhere that mediates the soul and the armor.

105
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,270
Precisely.

106
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,690
This seal of blood...

107
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,820
If you destroy it, you win.

108
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,740
You're awfully kind to let me in on your weakness.

109
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,740
I'm the type that seeks thrills in fighting.

110
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,210
Since you're so kind, want to let me off the hook?

111
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,420
Was that worth a try?

112
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,510
Do you really think a murderer is just going to let his prey get away?

113
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,680
Here I come!

114
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,640
Like~I~said~

115
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,890
Elicia's having her third birthday!

116
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:05,850
East City
Eastern Headquarters

117
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:05,850
Lt. Colonel Hughes, I'm working right now.

118
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,860
What a coincidence! So am I.

119
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,360
But seriously, she's so cute.

120
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,610
I get it! Quit calling me about your daughter all the time.

121
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,450
And with an army line, too!

122
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,990
Not just my daughter.

123
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,240
I'm proud of my wife, too!

124
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,870
All right, all right, I'll listen to your story, too.

125
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,250
About your cute and charming "Scar" you're so proud of.

126
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,510
We've found several unidentified bodies.

127
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,510
They're pretty decomposed, so it's
difficult to determine if he's in there.

128
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:47,230
There haven't been any sightings of him in the East,
so as of now, most people believe he's dead.

129
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,690
If that's the case, we can probably set
the Elric brothers free of their escorts soon.

130
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,150
Is Major Armstrong still in charge of that?

131
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,740
Nah, apparently the Major's subordinates have taken over.

132
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:01,950
They got us!

133
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,700
I knew they were being too quiet...

134
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:09,330
Major Armstrong's going to kill us for dereliction of duty!

135
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:13,000
Those brats! They should put themselves in their escorts' shoes every once in a while!

136
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,630
Let's go!

137
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,960
Huh? Where?

138
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,380
Where do you think?

139
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,380
The former Research Laboratory 5!

140
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,100
Huh? Something doesn't feel right in my shoulder...

141
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:40,160
...this time so it would be more resistant to rust,
but that makes it less durable, so don't overuse...

142
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,990
If I don't settle this quick...

143
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,330
...I'm in trouble!

144
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,360
You're almost like a monkey.

145
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,270
What'd you say?!

146
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,360
I haven't had worthy prey like you in a while. I'm delighted.

147
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:25,330
But with your wounds and fatigue, the outcome is clear.

148
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,540
My companion should have disposed of your companion by now.

149
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,960
Is your companion strong?

150
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,760
He is. Weaker than me, though.

151
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,140
No worries there, then.

152
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,650
I've been in a lot of fights with him
since we were little, and I've never won.

153
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:06,070
Dammit, stay still and let me cut you, hippo!

154
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,090
That body...

155
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,340
I've got a few circumstances of my own.

156
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,390
Actually, let me tell you a story.

157
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,600
You've heard of him, too, haven't you?

158
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,980
A middle-aged man by the name of Barry.

159
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:40,280
A long, long time ago, there was a middle-aged man here in Central named Barry who loved to cook.

160
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,110
Barry loved to cut up meat.

161
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:48,700
But one day, it got to the point he couldn't satisfy himself with just beef and pork,

162
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:53,500
so he started to go out into the city during nighttime to cut up humans.

163
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:02,630
Barry was eventually caught, but the number of people who fell victim to him was twenty-three.

164
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:09,930
After terrorizing the hell out of the residents of Central, he was sentenced to death by hanging.

165
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,060
And everyone lived happily ever after...

166
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,150
...is the story given to the public.

167
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,770
But there's actually a sequel to the story.

168
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,690
Barry isn't actually dead.

169
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,570
He's alive and has been assigned to watch over a certain somewhere.

170
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,320
Though he's had his body taken away.

171
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:38,920
That's right! The man standing in front of you right now is the infamous serial killer, Barry the Chopper!

172
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,290
Sorry, I've never heard of you.

173
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,510
I was born in the countryside in the East, so...

174
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,180
Yeah, but even if you've never heard the story, shouldn't you give some kind of reaction?!

175
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,010
Something like...

176
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:54,020
"AHHHH!", or "What's with that body?!"

177
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,770
AHHHH! W-W-W-What's with that body?!

178
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,060
That hurt, you know.

179
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,190
Oh, so you were sentenced to death, too.

180
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,280
Scaring me like that...

181
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,320
I'm not a criminal!

182
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,030
Huh? Then why?

183
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,820
Well... I've had a few circumstances of my own.

184
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,540
My older brother affixed my soul when I lost my body.

185
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,620
Brother?

186
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,580
I see. Your brother, eh?

187
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,500
What's so funny?

188
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,960
Are you guys really brothers?

189
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,470
I mean, our personalities are different, but...

190
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,720
Oh. No, no, no, that's not what I meant.

191
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,720
What I meant to say was, maybe you're
an armor doll your "brother" created?

192
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,680
Huh?

193
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,440
Does your real human self really exist?

194
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,650
Of course it does!

195
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:45,280
I'm Alphonse Elric, a human! No doubt about it!

196
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,240
How can you be so sure?

197
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,860
Because I have memories from when I was born!

198
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,240
What if those were created, too?

199
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,410
But Winry and Granny...

200
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,660
They're probably in on it, too.

201
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,830
Yeah, that's how it is.

202
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,340
You didn't exist to begin with.

203
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,960
T-Then... what about you?

204
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,880
It's simple.

205
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,640
Don't move! This place is restric-

206
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,680
See?

207
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,060
I love hacking live humans!

208
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,270
I love to kill, and I can't get enough of it!

209
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,070
I exist to kill.

210
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:28,860
That's the only proof I need to know that I am who I am!

211
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,450
So your little brother is that strong, eh?

212
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,290
Then I had better defeat you quickly.

213
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,460
Al, now!

214
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,170
What?!

215
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,840
How foul!

216
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,640
Like there are rules in a fight!

217
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:06,610
What's wrong? My blood seal isn't broken yet.

218
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,360
Just hurry up and dest-

219
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,530
There's something I want to ask you.

220
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,150
About the philosopher's stone?

221
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,120
Spill everything you know.

222
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,990
No can do.

223
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,040
Hey now, the loser shouldn't be putting on a brave front.

224
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,330
I... haven't lost yet.

225
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,750
Impossible!

226
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:41,770
I forgot to mention it. Slicer the Homicide...

227
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,390
...Was actually a duo of brothers.

228
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,900
The head and body are two different people?!

229
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,400
That's cheating.

230
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,610
And who's the one who said there aren't any rules in a fight?

231
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,740
Let's go for Round 2, runt.

232
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,120
Don't call me a runt!

233
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,700
Whoa, I'm not going to give you time for a transmutation!

234
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,330
Shit, I lost too much blood.

235
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,750
I'm starting to feel dizzy...

236
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,800
This is bad...

237
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,550
Bad...

238
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,970
I'm...

239
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:19,470
I'm going to die!

240
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,100
This is it for you!

241
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,400
Ouch...

242
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,490
Making me remember that jerk.

243
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:39,030
I just did the same thing he did.

244
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,410
You've gone and done it now, brat!

245
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,120
Man, that's disgusting!

246
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,250
Brother!

247
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,750
It's shameful, but we lost.

248
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:51,090
You're not going to say something like, "Hey, we're actually a trio", are ya?

249
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,090
We won't, we won't.

250
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,670
Just destroy us already, boy.

251
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,590
Spare me from having to murder someone.

252
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,180
You consider us human?

253
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:11,730
If I didn't accept you two as human,
it would mean I'm doing the same to my brother, too.

254
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,690
Hey now, what's wrong, armor doll?!

255
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,070
I'm not an armor doll!

256
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,910
That's what you think.

257
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,410
Did you really exist to begin with?

258
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,790
Are you sure about that?

259
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,370
There's a way to prove you're not an armor doll.

260
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,170
You've got a blood seal, too, don't you?

261
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,670
Erase it yourself.

262
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,760
If you die, you were human!

263
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,680
If you're still movin', then you're an armor doll!

264
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,220
I-I can't do something like that!

265
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:47,810
Then I'll do it for you!

266
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,480
My little brother is human.

267
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,480
So are you two.

268
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,440
That's why I don't want to kill you.

269
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:00,490
Brother?

270
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:07,160
Us two have been stealing, destroying,
and murdering ever since we came of age.

271
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:12,670
And we're being treated as humans for the first time, after being turned into this?

272
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,250
Interesting.

273
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:18,880
I'll tell you everything as a parting gift, boy.

274
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:24,220
The one who created the philosopher's stone and told us to guard this place is...

275
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,940
That was close.

276
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,610
You can't be talking about things like that, 48.

277
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,820
Huh? What's the Fullmetal runt doing here?

278
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,030
What a troublesome child.

279
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,330
How did you find out about this place?

280
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,210
Brother! Brother?!

281
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,960
BROTHER!!!

282
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,340
You're so annoying, dumbass!

283
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,640
You guys were about to kill a precious sacrifice!

284
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,930
Don't you understand?!

285
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,970
What were you gonna do if you screwed up the plan?!

286
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,270
Huh?!

287
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,660
Who the hell are you two?!

288
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,620
What plan?!

289
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,330
What do you mean by sacrifice?!

290
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:35,460
Oh? This runt is ready to go.

291
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,710
Quit calling me a runt!

292
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,670
A runt's a runt, don't you agree?

293
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,550
I don't like fighting.

294
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,140
It hurts if you get injured.

295
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,390
You're the one that started it!

296
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,430
I'll beat you to a...

297
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,810
Looks like it's broken.

298
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,320
WHAT?!

299
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,070
Lucky me!

300
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,740
Good thing your arm broke.

301
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,910
You didn't have to suffer any other injuries.

302
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,830
Listen, boy.

303
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:15,670
Don't forget you're being kept alive.

304
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:20,170
It'll be troublesome if a boy like this
happens to find this place again.

305
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:23,260
Let's burn it down.

306
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:30,100
Hey... there's something I've always wanted to ask you...

307
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,220
...but I've been too scared to.

308
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,980
What was Brother trying to say?

309
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,440
"Something he was too scared to say?"

310
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,070
Something he was too scared to...

311
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:45,320
...maybe you're an armor doll your "brother" created?

312
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,780
Does your real human self really exist?

313
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,910
What's wrong, armor dollie?

314
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,920
Shut up!! I'm...

315
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,380
Just accept it. It'll make you feel better.

316
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,340
You're full of openings, hippo!

317
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,850
Huh?!

318
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:11,930
Don't move!

319
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,470
Just surrender.

320
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,020
This isn't good...

321
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,280
Sergeant... evacuate!

322
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,000
What are you doing?!

323
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,210
Hurry and get out of here!

324
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,420
But Brother's still inside!

325
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,880
What did you say?!

326
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:45,920
Well, this leaves me no choice.

327
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,840
I guess I'll just get out of here!

328
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,010
Hey!

329
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,720
You guys better run, too!

330
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,220
Wait!

331
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,140
Brother! Brother!

332
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,010
Get out of here!

333
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,850
You'll get caught in it, too!

334
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:56,640
But!

335
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,480
Howdy.

336
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,520
A package for you.

337
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,900
Brother?!

338
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:14,120
He isn't in danger or anything, but he lost a lot of blood, so get him to a hospital quick, okay?

339
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:19,210
Oh yeah, and make sure you guys keep an eye on him so he doesn't do anything too reckless.

340
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,540
He's an important guy, after all.

341
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,630
And who are you?

342
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,540
Second Lt. Ross, hurry!

343
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,380
Sergeant, lend me a hand!

344
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,420
He's covered in blood!

345
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,010
We'll talk later! You'd better get out of here, too-

346
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,680
Huh? He's gone.

347
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,850
Let us out!

348
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,360
You plannin' on lettin' us die?!

349
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,610
Shut up! Pipe down!

350
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,780
What a nice sound.

351
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:56,490
This is the sound of a building crumbling due to explosives.

352
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:01,620
Judging from the proximity... it's probably Research Laboratory 5 next door.

353
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,380
Ah, what a nice sound...

354
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,750
It shakes me to my bones.

355
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,090
Shut your trap, Kimbley!

356
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,130
Ah, I apologize.

357
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:18,350
It reminded me of the Ishbal Extermination, and it just made me so happy...

358
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,110
...maybe you're an armor doll your "brother" created?

359
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,710
Ano hi mita sora akaneiro no sora wo

360
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,710
Say, the sky we saw that day, the scarlet sky.

361
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:49,920
Do you remember it from that day?

362
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:49,920
Nee kimi wa oboeteimasuka

363
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:55,850
We made a promise and a vow while the early summer wind circled us.

364
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:55,850
Yakusoku chigiri shoka no kaze ga tsutsumu

365
00:21:55,850 --> 00:22:00,100
And we clung close together.

366
00:21:55,850 --> 00:22:00,100
Futari yorisotta

367
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:09,150
Your forced smile

368
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:09,150
Muri na egao no ura

369
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:14,530
Holds elongated shadows.

370
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:14,530
Nobita kage wo kakumau

371
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:23,790
Dakara kizukanu furi saisei wo erabu

372
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:23,790
I pretend not to notice and continue on.

373
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:33,300
All the while waiting for you to deliver some news at the table.

374
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:33,300
Teeburu no ue no furuenai shirase machitsuzukete

375
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:41,680
Empty nights, mornings that will never arrive,

376
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:41,680
Kuuhaku no yoru mo kuru hazu no nai asa mo

377
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,440
I could see them from a mile away.

378
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,440
Zenbu wakattetanda

379
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:52,070
Say, the sky we saw that day, the scarlet sky.

380
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:52,070
Ano hi mita sora akaneiro no sora wo

381
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:56,990
I'm sure you'll remember it one day.

382
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:56,990
Nee itsuka omoidasu deshou

383
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:02,830
While holding the promise we couldn't keep,

384
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:02,830
Hatasenakatta yakusoku wo idaite

385
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:07,080
We take our first steps down our own paths.

386
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:07,080
Futari arukidasu

387
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,340
And so, about Central...

388
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:17,130
The bigwigs who oversee State Alchemists are going through a labor shortage thanks to Scar.

389
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,470
Oh?

390
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,810
Rumor is it won't be long before
Colonel Mustang is invited to Central.

391
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,270
Central, huh?

392
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,810
Not bad.

393
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,480
You'd better watch out.

394
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:31,610
If you manage to get to the top at that age,
you'll gain a lot of enemies.

395
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,230
I'm prepared for it.

396
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,110
Words of wisdom from your senior in Central.

397
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:42,660
Have a lot of people who understand and are willing to support you.

398
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:43,870
So...

399
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,120
Hurry up and get married.

400
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,500
None of your business!

401
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,630
Why'd he hang up on me like that?

402
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:55,170
Lt. Colonel Hughes, please keep personal calls to a minimum!

403
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,710
Oh, sorry.

404
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:03,010
Edward Elric hesitates to speak his words...

405
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:07,010
...and Alphonse Elric becomes perplexed by Barry's words.

406
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:13,430
The one certainty is that a girl's memories hold the truth.

407
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,400
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

408
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,400
Episode 9, Created Feelings.

409
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:21,410
Created Feelings

410
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:26,320
Their hearts waver because they put their trust in each other.
