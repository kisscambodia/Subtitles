1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,150
The new morning we've finally found

2
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,150
Yatto mitsuketa atarashii asa wa

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,190
is being hampered by the past.

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,190
Tsukihi ga jama wo suru

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,660
What we chased after wasn't the future,

6
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,660
Mukau saki wa tsugi ja nakute

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,490
but the past so full of remorse.

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,490
Sugi bakari oikaketa

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,960
Nariyamanai yousha nai omoide tachi wa

10
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,960
The ruthless memories won't stop playing;

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,050
they won't be forgiving us for a long time.

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,050
Yurushite kuresou nimonai

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,890
It's about now that a teardrop

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,890
Sorosoro kana tesaguri tsukareta hoho wo

15
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,560
beings to roll down my fatigued cheeks.

16
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,560
Kattou ga koboreochiru

17
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,810
Will this rain ever stop?

18
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,810
Ame wa itsuka yamunodeshouka

19
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:52,030
Zuibun nagai aida tsumetai

20
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:52,030
I've been freezing for a long time.

21
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,320
Why does the rain continue to fix on me?

22
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,320
Ame wa doushite boku wo erabuno

23
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,080
I wonder if it could embrace me.

24
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,080
Tsutsumarete iikana

25
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,870
Today, the rain falls again;

26
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,870
Ame wa yamu koto wo shirazuni

27
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,090
endlessly it falls knowing no end.

28
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,090
Kyou mo furitsuzukukeredo

29
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,130
Sotto sashidashita kasa no naka de

30
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,130
We nestle close to each other to share the warmth

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:28,850
under this umbrella, you gently held out to me.

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:28,850
Nukumori ni yorisoinagara

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Immortal Legion

34
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,010
It hurts...

35
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,760
Help me...

36
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,760
I'm starving!

37
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,930
Water...!

38
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,100
It hurts!

39
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,600
"Not yet finished experimenting"?

40
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,390
This in itself is the experiment!

41
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,850
It was a success!

42
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:15,360
The ultimate soldiers that never die, betray, and always fight according to our orders.

43
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,110
An immortal army has been created!

44
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,950
Pa...pa?

45
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,290
That's right!

46
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,830
I am your father!

47
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,210
Now, listen closely to what I'm about to say.

48
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:35,130
Currently, there are several rebels targeting these headquarters!

49
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,670
Papa!

50
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,340
You all are to-

51
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,660
Ouch...

52
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,710
That hurts.

53
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,790
That hurts!

54
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,420
Pain!

55
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,540
That hurts...

56
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,250
Ouch...

57
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,380
It hurts...

58
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,420
The pain...

59
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,980
What a huge gate.

60
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,350
I don't like the feeling it gives off.

61
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,150
Is this really the place?

62
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:35,940
Yeah.

63
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,400
It looks exactly as Al described it.

64
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,650
Who the heck is that?

65
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,280
Number 66.

66
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,910
Barry the Chopper.

67
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,740
He was Slicer's partner.

68
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,010
Open...!

69
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,690
Dammit...!

70
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,730
How the hell are we supposed to open this?!

71
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,770
Step aside.

72
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,200
It opened-

73
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:45,300
Order the soldiers from Central that are fighting with the Briggs forces and Mustang to retreat.

74
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,430
Oh? Are you going to shoot?

75
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,940
Looks like your men aren't very disciplined.

76
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,650
If you don't hurry up and have them retreat,

77
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,570
the soldiers from Briggs will continue to fight with no mercy.

78
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,200
Wouldn't it bother you if you lost every single one of your soldiers?

79
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,890
Shut the northern, southern, eastern, and western gates that allow entry into the Central Headquarters!

80
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:34,060
Don't let a single enemy force from Briggs or Mustang's party enter!

81
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,060
So you're rotten, but it looks like you've still retained a set of testicles.

82
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,070
Don't get too cocky, bitch!

83
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:45,240
I'll have all of you monkeys from Briggs crushed-

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,040
Huh?

85
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,710
Oh, this one.

86
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,590
You're not supposed to interfere.

87
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,050
I was told to defeat you.

88
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,890
What a drag...

89
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,470
You've just created another spot for me at the top.

90
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,640
I thank you, Homunculus!

91
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:24,440
You've saved me from having to stain this celebrated sword passed down in my family for generations!

92
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,740
You-

93
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,550
They won't die?!

94
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,890
It hurts...

95
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,350
I'm starving!

96
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,890
It hurts!

97
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,100
The pain!

98
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,150
Brother!

99
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,400
Don't tell me...!

100
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,910
Did they attach souls to dolls?!

101
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,200
Dammit! There's no end to them!

102
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,240
What the hell are these things?!

103
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,330
Hell if I know!

104
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,410
Why aren't they dying?!

105
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,420
This is bad.

106
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,710
If we were to let them outside...!

107
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,640
Did something happen?

108
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,760
No idea.

109
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,140
I heard Colonel Mustang pulled a coup d'etat.

110
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,310
How frightening.

111
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,350
There, there. Don't cry.

112
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,230
What do we do...

113
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,780
You-

114
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,780
Oh no! They're getting out!

115
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,750
My bad, I sealed off the exit.

116
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,210
Don't worry about it.

117
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,300
If you hadn't done it, I would have destroyed the exit myself.

118
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,970
Now we can prepare for the worst!

119
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:18,390
Okay, so now that we don't have to worry about them getting out...

120
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:21,270
...let's show them what we've got!

121
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,190
It hurts!

122
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,570
So much pain!

123
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,780
How dare they make something like this...!

124
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,780
Guess we have to go through these guys first to give the old guy a beatdown.

125
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,870
This is gonna be rough!

126
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,090
Mustang is currently escaping in an ice cream truck!

127
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,590
Barricade the main roads!

128
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,760
The truck may look normal,
but it's filled with weapons and ammo!

129
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,970
Don't let your guard down!

130
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,770
A-A bear!

131
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,980
A bear with a mohawk!

132
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,780
Signal lost.

133
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:18,030
A bear with a mohawk...?

134
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,330
Captain Buccaneer from the Northern Army.

135
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,250
Colonel, it seems like it'll be difficult to enter the city.

136
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,420
Yeah.

137
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,550
An ice cream truck, huh...?

138
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,260
I wonder if they're doing well.

139
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,350
But it's irritating that I can't fight alongside them.

140
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:52,070
I never knew how annoying it can be to wait.

141
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,950
I've been hearing this sound since yesterday.

142
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,950
Hey Alphonse, what is that sound?

143
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,250
Selim's playing with my head.

144
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,130
He may be a monster on the inside, but I guess he's still a brat.

145
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,930
Make him stop, Alphonse!

146
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,140
Make him stop those noises!

147
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,350
It's morse code!

148
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,190
Signals the army uses for communication!

149
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,530
He's telling someone our current location-

150
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,300
Hi.

151
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,600
Thanks for coming to pick me up, Kimblee.

152
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,480
Seriously... please stop giving me extra work.

153
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,280
Come on, give me a break.

154
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,780
I won't let my guard down again.

155
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,010
W-What are these things?!

156
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,800
You tricked me, Envy!

157
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,810
D-Did not!

158
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,810
Immortality is just beyond-

159
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:51,810
Oww!

160
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,350
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

161
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,120
You bitch!!

162
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,390
Yes!!

163
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,100
Guess who's back?!

164
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:30,990
Thanks for bringing me here, little brat.

165
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,960
Why are there soldiers here?

166
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,670
Are they here to make us leave?

167
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,630
Oh no... there's nowhere else to go.

168
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,300
W-What's this all about?

169
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,640
Don't tell me they've found out where we're hiding...

170
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,100
Oh no, Alphonse!

171
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,730
Hang on, Doctor!

172
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,560
What if they found out you're Doctor Marcoh?!

173
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,900
But I can't just sit back and watch...

174
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,860
Take a moment to calm down.

175
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:11,070
If you were to be taken hostage,
it would only hurt Alphonse and the others.

176
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,370
It's dangerous to just move around without thinking.

177
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,790
Let's stay put.

178
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,960
Yeah? Yeah?

179
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,720
Are you alone?

180
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,770
I heard that Gluttony was here with you.

181
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,230
I made use of him.

182
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,690
You ate him?

183
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,150
Your own comrade?

184
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,570
Not a comrade. We're part of the same being.

185
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,030
We were born from the same father.

186
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,620
Think of it as "coming back together", per se.

187
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,580
I see.

188
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,540
Mr. Heinkel!

189
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,130
Wow, you're still alive?

190
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:12,550
Can't underestimate a chimera's survival power, after all.

191
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,970
Mr. Heinkel!

192
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,180
Dammit!

193
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,810
Let go!

194
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,810
I won't let you get away.

195
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,520
You-

196
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,620
Don't know when to give up, do you.

197
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,300
Stop running away.

198
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,860
What?

199
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,860
I knew it wouldn't work.

200
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,360
That's as far as you're going to get,
Major General Armstrong!

201
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:18,870
A shoot-on-sight order has been issued for your treason!

202
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,160
Ready!

203
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,210
Fire!

204
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,210
Idiot.

205
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,210
Placing your men in this situation is just foolish.

206
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,940
Here's to hoping that did some damage to you...

207
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,780
I've got you now.

208
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,740
Didn't get the wrong one this time.

209
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,710
Female general...

210
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,420
...must die.

211
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,520
Sister!!

212
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,060
Are you all right?!

213
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,820
Who are you even talking to, Alex?!

214
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,740
Glad to see you're safe.

215
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,160
And so, what is that thing?

216
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,490
A Homunculus.

217
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,870
A bullet isn't enough to even move him an inch.

218
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,410
Maybe a little budge with a cannon.

219
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,670
Oh, my!

220
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,790
This is my specialty!

221
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:57,430
Please let your brother, Alex, handle this!

222
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,300
Come, monster!

223
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,680
Such a drag...

224
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,530
Don't mind me...

225
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,280
Hurry up... and escape...

226
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,370
No!

227
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,200
Don't be stupid.

228
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,540
At this rate, neither of us will make it.

229
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,960
If you leave me behind, at least you may be able to survive.

230
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,670
I said, no!

231
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:37,420
Focus on living for now!

232
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,720
Idiot!

233
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,180
Take a good look at reality.

234
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,140
We're put against Kimblee and Pride.

235
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,020
Just leave me behind...!

236
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,900
Don't give up!

237
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,860
I'll save you for sure!

238
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,950
Dammit...!

239
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,700
Move, stupid leg!

240
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:10,250
We can't lose here!

241
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,500
Mr. Heinkel, hang onto me!

242
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,590
Don't you dare give up!

243
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,670
You siblings are so...

244
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:26,680
Why do you try to save others
when you're all damaged as well?

245
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,270
I made a promise.

246
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,110
I made a promise with Brother,

247
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,400
that we won't let anyone die again.

248
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,660
You're right.

249
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,290
I recall even Kimblee saying that "if you survive, you win."

250
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:57,170
Thanks to that, I remembered that I had something good with me.

251
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,180
Why do you have this?

252
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:10,930
I picked it up at the mines to the north after being abandoned by Kimblee...

253
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,560
A philosopher's stone...

254
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,270
We really may be able to beat them if we have this.

255
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,820
But still!

256
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,860
Yeah, I know.

257
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,990
This is made of human lives, right?

258
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:32,040
I've heard from your brother that you guys don't want to use this to return to your bodies.

259
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,000
In that case...

260
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:40,550
In that case, use them to save the world; not for yourselves.

261
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,510
I'm asking you because you're willing to acknowledge them as human lives,

262
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:48,510
even after being reduced to such a state.

263
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,980
I can understand their feelings.

264
00:20:53,940 --> 00:21:00,020
No matter what they may look like now, they still want to fight to protect what's precious to them.

265
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,450
Give them a chance to fight too.

266
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,620
Okay.

267
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,620
Give them a good beatdown,

268
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,590
Alphonse.

269
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,840
Yeah.

270
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,720
Let's fight them together.

271
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:30,310
This cloud of dust is annoying.

272
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:33,220
Should I blow it away with an explosion?

273
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,100
No,

274
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:37,980
they're both still inside it.

275
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,980
Besides, he won't be able to escape without his legs-

276
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,380
Oh, my.

277
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,050
Instead of escaping, you...

278
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,770
Marvelous.

279
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:20,980
Very entertaining, Alphonse Elric!

280
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:31,500
Ever since that day passed,

281
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:31,500
Ano hi kara zutto

282
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,750
I promised myself that I'd never cry.

283
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,750
Nakanaito kimetekitakedo

284
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:41,300
But even while I hoarded up the pain,

285
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:41,300
Itami wo kasanetemo

286
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:46,410
there was something I couldn't forgive myself for.

287
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:46,410
Nanika wo yurusezu ni ita

288
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,850
I'll never be able

289
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,850
Mou modorenai

290
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:52,350
to return to those days.

291
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:52,350
Ikutsumo no hibi

292
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:57,440
I'm still powerless.

293
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:57,440
Boku wa mada nanimo dekizuni

294
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,690
I watch as the shards of memories disappear, one by one;

295
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,690
Kimi no ita kioku no kakera

296
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:08,560
memories of when you were still with me.

297
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:08,560
Mata hitotsu kieteyuku

298
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,580
I long to become

299
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,580
Kyou yori motto

300
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,330
stronger than I am now,

301
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,330
Tsuyoku naritai

302
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:19,470
so that my voice will eventually reach you.

303
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:19,470
Kono koe ga itsuka todokuyouni

304
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,840
If the wind happens to stop

305
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,840
Arukitsuzukete

306
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,550
in the midst of my long journey,

307
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,550
Kaze ga yandara

308
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:29,260
I'll look up at the sky in search of you.

309
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:29,260
Kimi wo sagashite sora miageruyo

310
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:36,600
Beyond the daybreak, a ray of light breaks free.

311
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:36,600
Yoake no saki ni hikari ga sasuyo

312
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:42,150
A rainbow spans across the sky.

313
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:42,150
Niji ga kakaruyo

314
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:04,540
If it's a fight between man and man, choose the path you believe is right.

315
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:10,840
Only a fool would stand indecisive after being frightened at the thought of being soiled by the mud.

316
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,300
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

317
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,830
Episode 52, Combined Strength.

318
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:20,830
Combined Strength

319
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,170
It is beyond the point of hesitation.
