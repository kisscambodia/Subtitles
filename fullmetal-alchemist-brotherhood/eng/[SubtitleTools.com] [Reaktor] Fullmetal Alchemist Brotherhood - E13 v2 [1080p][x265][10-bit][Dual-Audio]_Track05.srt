1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,940
But I'm amazed you were able to come back alive after seeing that thing.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,730
To be expected of my student, I guess.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:07,980
That's...

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,110
But rules are rules.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:14,530
You're expelled.

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,790
Master-

7
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:19,370
Al.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,630
The trains are still running.

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,960
Go home.

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,340
Thanks... for everything.

11
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,940
I've still got a lot of years ahead of me

12
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,940
Kono omoi wo keshiteshimau niwa

13
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,940
Mada jinsei nagai desho?

14
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,850
To just erase these feelings?

15
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:36,900
To just erase these feelings?

16
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:36,940
To just erase these feelings?

17
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,940
I want to go back and finish

18
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,940
Yarinokoshiteru koto

19
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,570
The things that I've yet to finish.

20
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,570
Yarinaoshite mitai kara

21
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:59,840
I was supposed to be chasing after my ongoing dream,

22
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:59,840
Yume no tsuzuki oikaketeita hazu nanoni

23
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:06,170
Yet I faltered over others while walking this thin, winding path.

24
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:06,170
Magarikunetta hosoi michi hito ni tsumazuku

25
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,340
It's not that I want to return to those days.

26
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,340
Ano koro mitainitte modoritai wake ja nai no

27
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,850
I'm searching for the sky I lost.

28
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,850
Nakushitekita sora wo sagashiteru

29
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,520
Don't make that sad face, as if you've fallen victim.

30
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,520
Wakatte kuremasu youni

31
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,730
As if you want people to pity you.

32
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,730
Gisei ni natta youna kanashii kao wa yameteyo

33
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,440
Tears aren't the end of your sins.

34
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,440
Tsumi no saigo wa namida ja nai yo

35
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,110
You have to bear them painfully, forever.

36
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,110
Zutto kurushiku seottekunda

37
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,780
Who are you waiting for in the maze of emotions,

38
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,780
Deguchi mienai kanjoumeiro ni

39
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,450
Dare wo matteruno?

40
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,450
Where you can't even see the exit?

41
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,240
I want to blurt it out more justly,

42
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,240
Shiroi nooto ni tsuzutta youni

43
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,990
Just like how I wrote it in my white notebook.

44
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,990
Motto sunao ni hakidashitai yo

45
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,660
What do you want to run from?

46
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,660
Nani kara nogaretainda

47
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,290
That thing called "reality"?

48
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,290
Genjitsu tte yatsu?

49
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,620
I just want to scream out,

50
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,620
Kanaeru tame ni ikiterundatte

51
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,040
"I'm only living to fulfill my wish." Can you hear me?

52
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,040
Sakebitaku naru yo kikoeteimasuka?

53
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,170
I can't take the safe way out of everything.

54
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,170
Bunan ni nante yatterarenaikara

55
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,970
I don't even have a place to return to.

56
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,970
Kaeru basho mo nai no

57
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:50,260
I'm always thankful for everyone's kindness,

58
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:50,260
Yasashisa ni wa itsumo kansha shiteru

59
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,640
That's why I want to become stronger. (I'm on the way)

60
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,640
Dakara tsuyoku naritai (I'm on the way)

61
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,600
This is reminding me of the old days.

62
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,600
Natsukashiku naru

63
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,850
This pain is all right with me.

64
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,850
Konna itami mo kangei jan

65
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:04,650
Beasts of Dublith

66
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,190
Drop by if you're ever in the neighborhood.

67
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,270
But we're...

68
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,150
Idiot!

69
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,150
If you aren't in a master-student relationship anymore,

70
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,740
it means that from now on,
you're going to treat each other as individuals.

71
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,040
What's holding you back?

72
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,290
Dammit!

73
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,750
Al! What did we come to Dublith for?

74
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,000
Mr. Sig, we're going to head back!

75
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,800
Don't let her kill you.

76
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,300
Master!

77
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,480
What did you come back for?!

78
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,440
Who are you calling Master?!

79
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,350
You guys aren't my students anymore!

80
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,230
Go home already!

81
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,150
Master!

82
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:56,360
We came here to find clues on how to get our bodies back.

83
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,900
We can't go back with nothing.

84
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,400
Go home!

85
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,780
We won't!

86
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,710
Morons...

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,210
You didn't see the truth, did you, Al?

88
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:17,050
No. I have no idea what you mean...

89
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,970
Maybe you lost your memories due to shock.

90
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,850
How about we try retrieving your memories?

91
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,970
You had your whole body taken.

92
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,470
There's no way you didn't see it.

93
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,020
I get it!

94
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:36,940
You and I only had parts of our bodies taken, so if it's based on how much we paid, Al should know the most of the truth!

95
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,410
So if we can get my memories back, we might find a clue on how to get our bodies back...

96
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,370
But memories of that thing, huh?

97
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,410
That thing, huh?

98
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,160
Huh? Could this be bad?

99
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,330
More like... extraordinary?

100
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,250
Yeah, you could call it that.

101
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,840
Your mind might explode...

102
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,500
If you screw up, it could destroy you...

103
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,510
But if it'll let us find a clue...

104
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,300
I want to do it!

105
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,270
Fine.

106
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,440
Let me ask a friend of mine how to regain one's memories.

107
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,070
But before that, let's eat.

108
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:17,940
You'd better help out.

109
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,230
Yes, ma'am!

110
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:24,530
No doubt about it. That's the guy who affixed a soul.

111
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,710
East City
Eastern Headquarters

112
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,090
You'll be working in Central starting next week.

113
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,590
Yes, sir.

114
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,340
It'll become quiet around here.

115
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,930
You were quite the flashy one.

116
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,600
Not anywhere near as flashy as you were in your prime, sir.

117
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,990
I was able to relax because you worked so hard.

118
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:08,160
But I also learned a lot from all of those jobs you gave me.

119
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,040
Check.

120
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,340
I was finally able to beat you.

121
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,420
Let's call this victory a parting gift.

122
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,300
General.

123
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,220
I'd also like to ask for another gift.

124
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,930
Sgt. Major Kain Fuery.

125
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,390
Warrant Officer Vato Falman.

126
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,730
2nd Lt. Heymans Breda.

127
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,310
2nd Lt. Jean Havoc.

128
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,310
Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye.

129
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,650
The five of you will be transferring to Central with me.

130
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,740
I won't take any complaints.

131
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,570
Come with me!

132
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,540
Colonel, I can't.

133
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,210
I just recently found a girlfriend.

134
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,290
Break up with her.

135
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,430
Again?!

136
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,390
Your wounds haven't even healed yet.

137
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,360
Master...

138
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,860
I'm so happy to see you're well.

139
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,870
I heard rumors about you going around killing State Alchemists.

140
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,660
I understand your resentment.

141
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:39,080
The ones who annihilated our village were State Alchemists.

142
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,630
But all revenge does is give birth to more revenge.

143
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,010
A futile chain like that must be stopped immediately.

144
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,600
You must persevere.

145
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,520
Sorry to interrupt.

146
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,850
Whoa, he really was here!

147
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,390
An Ishbalan with a cross scar on his forehead.

148
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:02,900
We're splitting the prize money like we agreed, Mr. Yoki.

149
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,480
Huh? Where's Mr. Yoki?

150
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,490
Hey!

151
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,860
What's this all about?

152
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,950
You had nowhere to go, so we treated you like family-

153
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:12,950
Shut up!

154
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,200
Don't go comparing me with you Ishbalans!

155
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,950
I'm going to rise again!

156
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:24,210
I'm going to keep rising and rising,
and eventually get rid of that damned Edward Elric!

157
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,090
Now you two, please do your thing.

158
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,010
Seems I'll only bring trouble while I'm here.

159
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,850
You're an obedient one.

160
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,310
Y-You bastard! What did you do?!

161
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,650
I'll give you some time to pray to God.

162
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,400
G-God? You seriously think I believe-

163
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,620
Wait!

164
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,540
Stay away!

165
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,950
I-I was wrong!

166
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,160
Please spare my life!

167
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,960
I'll follow you forever!

168
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,130
Are you going?

169
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,420
You'll sadden your brother.

170
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,180
There's no going back for me.

171
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,800
Here he comes.

172
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,890
We were waiting for you, guest.

173
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,850
"We know your secret."

174
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,560
"Come to Devil's Nest."

175
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,560
Are you the ones who know this "secret"?

176
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,150
We sure are. We know quite a lot.

177
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:14,150
I also want to know my own secret.

178
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,870
Then it's settled.

179
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,240
Follow me.

180
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,000
But my master taught me not to follow strangers.

181
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,410
How old are you?

182
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,670
Fourteen.

183
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,670
If you're fourteen, shouldn't you be able to make your own decisions?

184
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,760
You can't be saying things like "master taught me" forever.

185
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,680
I see! I have to make my own decisions then, huh?

186
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,970
That's right!

187
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,010
So come with-

188
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:45,890
So I decided to tie you guys up and beat the secrets out of you.

189
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,060
So in the end, you chose force.

190
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,910
I'm coming in!

191
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,530
Y-You're inside-

192
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,870
Hey, stay put!

193
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,960
How does it feel to have your body controlled from the inside?

194
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,750
Even if you do this, you can't stop my movements completely!

195
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,210
You're right. But...

196
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,920
As long as I can restrict your movements just a bit...

197
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,970
We can win the fight.

198
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,850
Did I hurt you?

199
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,810
I hit my head.

200
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,350
Giving us trouble...

201
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,610
Who are you guys...

202
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,690
They're chimeras.

203
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,190
My henchmen.

204
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,840
Wow, that's so cool! You really are empty.

205
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,880
I'm Greed.

206
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,760
Let's try to get along.

207
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,720
What are you guys, really?

208
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,980
You were lying about being chimeras, right?

209
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,850
There's no way chimeras can talk!

210
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,480
There's no way "there's no way".

211
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:18,570
Since this girl who's inside you right now is a chimera that was transmuted with a snake.

212
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:22,660
And Loa, who's behind me... What are you again?

213
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,160
A cow?

214
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,200
Yes.

215
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,620
Other than that, we've got a lizard and a crocodile.

216
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,250
The guy you fought earlier takes a piss with one leg up.

217
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,590
I do not!

218
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,340
You're a dog?

219
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,590
Yeah. It's pretty useful.

220
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,050
No way...

221
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,680
That can't be true!

222
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,350
And besides, who are you going to say performed the transmutation successfully?

223
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,850
The army.

224
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,390
No way...

225
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:52,850
Anyway, it just means there's a flip side to this world that society doesn't know about.

226
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,650
On a different note, I'm not a chimera.

227
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,280
I'm a homunculus.

228
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,900
Homunculus?!

229
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,320
You've heard of them, haven't you?

230
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,780
Humans that were created artificially.

231
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,950
That's what I am.

232
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,580
Homunculus?

233
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,580
It's another name for an android.

234
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,590
But it's said in the book that you're not allowed to create humans.

235
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,880
You're lying!

236
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,590
I've never even heard of anyone creating a homunculus!

237
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,220
Geez...

238
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,840
Let me show you some proof.

239
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,230
W-What did you do that for?!

240
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,080
That's one death for me.

241
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,750
No way...

242
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,130
Do you understand now?

243
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,460
There's no way "there's no way".

244
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,340
Besides, aren't you living proof of that?

245
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,050
An existence with a soul and no body.

246
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,100
How did you...

247
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,220
I know just about everything that goes on in this other world.

248
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,600
Let's get to the point.

249
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,020
How does it feel to be immortal with just a soul?

250
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:25,160
Transmuting a soul and affixing it to another object.

251
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,700
If you do it correctly, that person can gain eternal life.

252
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,240
Am I wrong?

253
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,830
I'm Greed.

254
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,910
I'm greedy,

255
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:41,670
so I want money, women, status, fame, and everything else in this world!

256
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,010
And I want eternal life!

257
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,840
But aren't you already immortal?

258
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,720
I was made pretty durable,

259
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,220
so I've been alive for almost two hundred years.

260
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,640
But I'm not quite immortal.

261
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,100
Now, I've told you my secret.

262
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,020
It's your turn.

263
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,440
Tell me the secret to that body.

264
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,450
You should spill it.

265
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:10,660
You don't want to be taken apart and dissected, do you?

266
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,700
It's impossible.

267
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,410
I don't have any memories of when I became like this,

268
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,500
and I'm not the one who performed the transmutation.

269
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,340
I don't know anything.

270
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,170
Then what about the guy who did it?

271
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,840
We can ask him.

272
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,880
That's...

273
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,220
Where the heck did Al disappear to?

274
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,720
I don't mind telling ya.

275
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,020
If you tell us his secret, that is.

276
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,360
Brother!

277
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,780
I would never have expected you to get kidnapped.

278
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,200
Brother, this guy's a homunculus!

279
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
Homunculus?

280
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,580
Hey, don't go blowing my secret!

281
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,500
So he might have a hint on how to get our bodies back!

282
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,880
Tattoo of Ouroboros.

283
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,090
That's how it is.

284
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:10,510
It would have been easier if we could have just settled things with the armor boy.

285
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,810
If you're buddies with them,
why don't you just ask them yourself?

286
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:15,640
"Them"?

287
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,850
There were people with that tattoo at Research Laboratory 5.

288
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:23,110
And there, I met a guy who had
his soul affixed to a piece of armor.

289
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,980
Seriously?

290
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,360
Well, for certain reasons,

291
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,400
I can't really do that.

292
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,620
So let's discuss this.

293
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:36,160
You two want to get your bodies back, right?

294
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,500
I'll teach you how to create a homunculus.

295
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,130
And in exchange, you teach me how to transmute a soul.

296
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,840
It's called equivalent exchange.

297
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,300
But seriously...

298
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,600
Is there even a need to get your body back?

299
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,520
Personally, I think that body can be somewhat useful.

300
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,520
No, it's not!

301
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,850
You think so?

302
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:04,020
You don't get hungry,
you don't get sleepy, you don't get tired.

303
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,020
Sounds awesome to me!

304
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:13,160
Cut... The...

305
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,910
...Shit!!!

306
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,620
Useful?! Awesome?!

307
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:24,920
You don't know anything,
and yet you're spewing all this bullshit?!

308
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,880
How to transmute a soul?!

309
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:32,220
You're not getting an ounce of it from me!!!

310
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:37,680
If you're a villain, I'll beat you up, smack you,
punch the information out of you and snatch it!!

311
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,390
In other words, I get all and you get nothing!

312
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:46,980
There's no need for equivalent exchange when dealing with a villain!!!

313
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,410
Guess we have to use force again.

314
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,950
Don't kill him.

315
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,450
Fine, fine.

316
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,750
I met a guy on death row who was a lot faster than you!

317
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,790
Next.

318
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,010
Loa, take the armor boy with you.

319
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,670
We'll take him apart and dissect him.

320
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,260
Roger.

321
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:14,970
H-Hey!

322
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:15,760
Wait!

323
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,230
Useless.

324
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:34,740
With a steel sword like that, you can't even add a scratch to this ultimate shield!

325
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,040
Your head's wide open!

326
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,090
Oww... that hurt.

327
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,840
If I was an ordinary human,
I'd need to go to the hospital for this.

328
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,880
Yeah, but you're not really ordinary at all.

329
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,050
Well, my body is normal,

330
00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:00,560
but I've got a little bit of regeneration, and I have the ultimate shield.

331
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,770
Get it now?

332
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,390
You can't beat me.

333
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,060
It'd be smarter to just make the trade.

334
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,310
Oh, you're one of those people, aren't you?

335
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:12,070
You don't care if you get covered in wounds,

336
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:16,150
but if your relatives get hurt,
you can't take it and lose your cool.

337
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,360
How foolish.

338
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,080
You're going to let your strong feelings take over like that and lose important information and your brother?

339
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,910
I'll go get my brother back after I beat your ass.

340
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,750
Your regeneration ability isn't endless, right?

341
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,960
As long as I keep hitting the part of you that's flesh, then...

342
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,260
My bad, sorry for going easy on you.

343
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:41,470
This turns me into an ugly guy,
so I don't really like to show people.

344
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,680
Didn't I say so?

345
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,640
You won't even be able to scratch me.

346
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,860
I found this in the back alley of West Street.

347
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,400
Al disappeared... and now Ed, too.

348
00:18:55,230 --> 00:19:01,570
Those idiots! I may even have to make them students again and teach them about taking care of personal belongings!

349
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,280
I've got it!

350
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:07,960
I heard someone who looks like Ed went into a bar called Devil's Nest.

351
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,640
You dead?

352
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:29,520
Good! Kids should be lively.

353
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,110
No matter how many times you try, you can't win.

354
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,910
How about you tell me the secret now?

355
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,490
Thanks for that.

356
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:50,790
The blood that was all up in my head went away, and I can think clearly now.

357
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,790
That's my mechanic for ya.

358
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,250
It still moves after all this.

359
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,390
You're still going to resist?

360
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:06,470
Let this put you to sleep!

361
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,780
I'm solid, aren't I?

362
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,900
That's weird...

363
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,290
So what?!

364
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,420
What, don't you have anything else?!

365
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,930
What the hell... did you do to my shield....

366
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,510
It's simple if you think about it.

367
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:53,390
You said you're a homunculus, but if your body is normal, that means a third of your body is made up of carbon.

368
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:59,900
Depending on how the carbon atoms are combined, the toughness can range from a pencil tip's to a diamond's.

369
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,700
If you know that much, then it's all a matter of alchemy.

370
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,990
Good!

371
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,830
Otherwise, it wouldn't be fun!

372
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,790
And now, I just figured something out!

373
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,880
You can't harden and regenerate at the same time!

374
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,380
My first impression of you was that of a reckless idiot.

375
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,800
But how many more times can you attack me with that body?

376
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,270
Hi, coming in.

377
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,690
M-Master!

378
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,320
You dumbass!!!

379
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,530
You don't even care enough to put away a single broomstick?!

380
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,160
I-I'm sorry!

381
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,120
Looks like you gave my boys quite a bit of trouble.

382
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,660
Master! He's...

383
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,120
I know.

384
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,540
I could hear you all the way from the hallway.

385
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,460
Come on, give me a break.

386
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,760
I don't really like fighting women-

387
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,730
What... the hell are you?!

388
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,230
A passing...

389
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,200
...housewife!!!

390
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:33,080
Say, the sky we saw that day, the scarlet sky.

391
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:33,080
Ano hi mita sora akaneiro no sora wo

392
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:38,290
Do you remember it from that day?

393
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:38,290
Nee kimi wa oboeteimasuka

394
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:44,210
We made a promise and a vow while the early summer wind circled us.

395
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:44,210
Yakusoku chigiri shoka no kaze ga tsutsumu

396
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:48,470
And we clung close together.

397
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:48,470
Futari yorisotta

398
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:57,520
Your forced smile

399
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:57,520
Muri na egao no ura

400
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,900
Holds elongated shadows.

401
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,900
Nobita kage wo kakumau

402
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:12,160
I pretend not to notice and continue on.

403
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:12,160
Dakara kizukanu furi saisei wo erabu

404
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:21,670
All the while waiting for you to deliver some news at the table.

405
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:21,670
Teeburu no ue no furuenai shirase machitsuzukete

406
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:30,050
Empty nights, mornings that will never arrive,

407
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:30,050
Kuuhaku no yoru mo kuru hazu no nai asa mo

408
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:34,810
I could see them from a mile away.

409
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:34,810
Zenbu wakattetanda

410
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:40,440
Ano hi mita sora akaneiro no sora wo

411
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:40,440
Say, the sky we saw that day, the scarlet sky.

412
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,360
I'm sure you'll remember it one day.

413
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,360
Nee itsuka omoidasu deshou

414
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:51,200
While holding the promise we couldn't keep,

415
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:51,200
Hatasenakatta yakusoku wo idaite

416
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,450
We take our first steps down our own paths.

417
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,450
Futari arukidasu

418
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:06,610
Those who are strong are destined to yield to ones who are far stronger.

419
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:12,070
But their souls will not lose as long as they have pride.

420
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,450
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

421
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:21,460
Those Who Lurk
Underground

422
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:21,460
Episode 14, Those Who Lurk Underground.

423
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,500
There's more than meets the eye.
