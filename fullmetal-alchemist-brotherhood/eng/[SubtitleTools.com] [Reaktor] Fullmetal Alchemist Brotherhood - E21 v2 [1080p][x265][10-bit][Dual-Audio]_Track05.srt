1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,220
You idiot!!!

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:06,310
You believed the enemy's words and lost the will to fight?!

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,390
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,310
Don't lose your composure!

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,560
Do not simply accept death.

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,900
If you are truly my aide, then keep your head.

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:17,900
Yes, sir.

8
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,370
I'm going to continue to rely on you to watch my back. Be prepared.

9
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,490
You have no right to talk, Colonel.

10
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,080
What kind of commander wanders out in a mission like that?

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:29,790
Shut up!

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,920
Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow...

13
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,050
Besides, why am I in the same room as you?!

14
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,920
Aren't hospital rooms supposed to be singles with beautiful nurses?

15
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,800
You'll have to deal with it.

16
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,890
It's much easier for me to guard you two if you're recovering in the same room.

17
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,930
That's what's worrying me.

18
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,310
Why haven't they come to kill us?

19
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,310
Why?!

20
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,600
Why did you let the flame guy leave alive?!

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,730
He burned Lust to death!

22
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,610
Lust... died...

23
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,530
It's not too late! Go kill him!

24
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,910
Roy Mustang. We can use him.

25
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,580
Use? Don't tell me you're going to make him open the...

26
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,330
Worry not.

27
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,170
Father put me in charge of him.

28
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:26,230
Masshiro na keshiki ni ima sasowarete

29
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:26,230
Drawn by a landscape as white as snow,

30
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,780
I'm headed toward an unseen world.

31
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,780
Boku wa yuku yo mada minu sekai e

32
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,720
I've been traveling while lost

33
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,720
Maigo no mama tabi shiteita

34
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,510
Under this gray sky.

35
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,500
Nezumiiro no sora no shita

36
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:50,600
Every day with new maps, stained with my many dreams.

37
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:50,600
Higawari no chizu ikutsumo no yume ga nijindeita

38
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,990
I wonder if someday,

39
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,990
Itsuka wa sa

40
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:57,030
Even with these tiny steps of mine,

41
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:57,030
Chippoke na boku no kono hohaba demo

42
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:03,110
Ano kumo no mukou made yukeru kana

43
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:03,110
I'll be able to travel beyond those clouds.

44
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,740
I put on a bold front.

45
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,740
Tsuyogatte

46
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,290
End up hurting myself.

47
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,290
Kizutsuita

48
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,370
I feel empty inside.

49
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,370
Kokoro sukashita youni

50
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,910
It's started to rain,

51
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,910
Furidashita

52
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,080
And the raindrops

53
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,080
Amatsubu tachi ga

54
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,300
Began to repeat their scattered reflections.

55
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,300
Ranhansha kurikaesu

56
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,170
These straight rays of light

57
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,170
Massugu na hikari ga

58
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,890
Start to cross one another.

59
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,890
Kousa shite

60
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,470
And without telling anyone where they're headed,

61
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,470
Yakusaki mo tsugenumama

62
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,760
Across the endless distances,

63
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,760
Doko made mo

64
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,350
They pass through all matter.

65
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,350
Tsukinukeru

66
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:34,180
I burn these faint afterimages onto my eyes.

67
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:34,180
Awai zanzou ryoume ni yakitsukete

68
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,100
Under this sky,

69
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,100
Kono sora no shita

70
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,930
Wherever I am,

71
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,930
Donna toko ni itemo

72
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,230
Todoku hazu nanda

73
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,230
I should be able to reach

74
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:47,040
The unseen world.

75
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:47,040
Mada minu sekai e

76
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,060
What if it's decomposed?

77
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,100
What?

78
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,520
My body on the other side of the gate hasn't taken in any nutrition!

79
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,360
Even if I was able to return to a body like that...

80
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,530
Brother! Winry!

81
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,160
Really, Ed?!

82
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:16,540
This is only hypothetical, but when we tried to transmute Mom,

83
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,580
we used our blood in the formula as information for her soul, right?

84
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,630
Yeah.

85
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:26,880
Then, we were both taken to
the other side and were decomposed.

86
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:34,390
I wonder if there's a possibility our minds were entangled during that process?

87
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,140
What do you mean?

88
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:41,770
I'm wondering if it's possible your body and I are connected in some way.

89
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,730
You know, for my age, I'm sh-

90
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:48,860
Sh...

91
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,910
Short...

92
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,240
He said it.

93
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,160
He was able to face reality.

94
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,620
So you're saying your growth is connected to how Al would have grown?

95
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,420
Sounds crazy to me.

96
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,920
It's not crazy!

97
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,460
You're short because you never drink milk.

98
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,130
This again?!

99
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,340
Of course!

100
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,470
Now that I think about it, Brother is always sleeping.

101
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:16,430
Could it be he's making up for my sleep, too?

102
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,060
Drink it!

103
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,270
I said, no!

104
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,310
Do it!

105
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,140
No!

106
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:21,900
It would be nice if that's the case.

107
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,730
Drink it!

108
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,150
No!

109
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,180
Advance of the Fool

110
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,740
Paying the Colonel a visit?

111
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,740
Mr. Havoc is injured, too,
so we wanted to pay them a proper visit.

112
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,040
I'm not sure I would be here today
if the Colonel hadn't come to our rescue.

113
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,960
Is that why you're here, too, Sergeant Fuery?

114
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,790
Running some errands for the Lieutenant.

115
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:49,510
I've calculated the approximate distance to that large door...

116
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,180
...by counting the steps I took since entering Research Laboratory 3's basement.

117
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,470
The exact direction is unclear, so I drew a circle with the laboratory at the center, and...

118
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,020
Central headquarters?

119
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,020
And to top it off, this building is...

120
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,360
The Führer President's residence.

121
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,690
The Homunculi reside under there?

122
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,910
So there's a chance the Führer President has connections to them... eh?

123
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:22,460
If he does, then I wonder why he killed Greed and his crew?

124
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,250
He's still suspicious, even if he doesn't have ties to them.

125
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,960
He killed them all without even trying to extract information from them.

126
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,970
Führer President... He's mysterious.

127
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:37,510
Either way, the enemy has infiltrated pretty high up in the military command.

128
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,350
We ought to approach him with caution from now on.

129
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,020
Fullmetal. Take care of yourself.

130
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,730
Homunculus and the Führer President...

131
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,780
We were able to fish out something larger than expected.

132
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,820
I also have a feeling it's a bit too large...

133
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,620
It wouldn't be worthwhile otherwise.

134
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,410
Well, I have a lot of work for all of you.

135
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,460
Oh yeah, about that.

136
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,880
I won't be able to participate.

137
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,340
I can't... feel my legs.

138
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,050
I'm sorry.

139
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,560
Looks like an early retirement for me.

140
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,690
Yo.

141
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,730
Hey. Are you not feeling well?

142
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,150
Backache.

143
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,240
Coroners are always standing,
so it's a tough job for old guys like me.

144
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:44,160
I knew right away when I heard you were the one who killed her.

145
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,160
What are you up to?

146
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,840
So you declared that thing was Second Lieutenant Ross when you knew I was up to something?

147
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,010
War buddies are wonderful to have.

148
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,880
We're not war buddies; more like accomplices in crime.

149
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,260
You burned them up; I dissected them.

150
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,390
Ishbal was a giant experimental site.

151
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:12,610
If you keep taking risks like that, you'll get tit for tat.

152
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,990
Already done.

153
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,410
Did something happen?

154
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,370
My comrade...

155
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,750
...is paralyzed from the waist down due to a spinal injury.

156
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,880
And I just got permission to have one smoke a day, too...

157
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,810
Geez, isn't that just hilarious?
Getting stabbed by a woman and having to retire.

158
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,890
What are you going to do after you retire?

159
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,190
My family runs a general store.

160
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,810
I can at least help out by answering the phone.

161
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,570
Can't you get an automail?

162
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,410
They said it's not possible since the neural network for the entire lower half of my body is disconnected.

163
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,750
Retirement doesn't suit you one bit.

164
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:12,880
Colonel.

165
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,000
About Havoc's legs...

166
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,720
...here's some information I got from the Fullmetal boss.

167
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,140
Dr. Marcoh.

168
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,930
An alchemist well-versed in medicine.

169
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,640
The Philosopher's Stone?!

170
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,310
Would it be possible to have my vacation extended?

171
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,900
I permit it.

172
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,110
Go.

173
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,530
Ah, Major!

174
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,160
Are you back from your vacation, sir?

175
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,450
How was your trip to the east?

176
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,950
You can't tell anyone.

177
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,210
It was a nice place with lots of beauties.

178
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,420
I see...

179
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,040
Oh, right, Major.

180
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,210
This is from military police headquarters.

181
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,630
They want all the State Alchemists to know first.

182
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,760
This is...

183
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,640
How was it?

184
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,480
They let me in without objection when I told them I was a State Alchemist.

185
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,770
What about the entrance to the basement?

186
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,110
Wasn't there.

187
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:22,150
But there were traces of it being covered up with alchemy.

188
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,620
They're not so stupid as to leaving the entrance wide open.

189
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,160
I see.

190
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,210
I guess it's not possible for us to go
and meet the Homunculi from here.

191
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:38,960
They said something about not wanting me killed because I'm an important sacrifice.

192
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,420
They said that to me, too.

193
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,720
That I could become a sacrifice because I'd opened the gate.

194
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,390
My guess is that these sacrifices...

195
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:50,430
...are alchemists who are capable of opening the gate and returning.

196
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:54,100
What are they planning on doing by making us sacrifices?

197
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,440
I'll beat it out of them!

198
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,940
Edward!

199
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,230
Huh? Sergeant Brosh?

200
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,650
Good thing I found you!

201
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,200
Hey, what happened?

202
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,910
You ought to go back to the hotel immediately!

203
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,330
If you wish, I'll call for escorts!

204
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,750
A notification to the entire city from military police headquarters.

205
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,670
It seems Scar has appeared in Central once again.

206
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,590
Three casualties, all of whom are State Alchemists.

207
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,420
Several others wounded.

208
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:25,680
According to witnesses, he has a large cross-shaped scar on his forehead.

209
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,890
An Ishbalan with tattoos all over his right arm.

210
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,560
Tattoos... on his right arm!

211
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,530
Scar killed the Rockbells?!

212
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,950
It's not certain yet.

213
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,080
No way...

214
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,790
Brother, you can't tell Winry about this.

215
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,040
Like I could even if I wanted to.

216
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,330
I don't ever want to see her cry again.

217
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,460
Me neither.

218
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:06,680
I guess we'll have to face Scar again.

219
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,720
You're going to try to find out the truth?

220
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,600
That, too, but I have something else in mind.

221
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,220
We'll use him to lure out the Homunculi.

222
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,230
Huh?

223
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,190
They want to keep me alive.

224
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:22,110
So if I'm attacked by Scar and in danger...

225
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,030
They'll show themselves?

226
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,240
I don't think that's very likely...

227
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,610
But it's better than sitting around and doing nothing.

228
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:32,620
But we were defeated by him in an instant last time!

229
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,410
I'm sure we've... gotten a bit stronger-

230
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,340
And even if the Homunculi do show themselves, how do we catch them?!

231
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,710
Not only are they strong,
but they're pretty much invincible!

232
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,720
Invincible?!

233
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,170
Which means...

234
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,010
Immortality, correct?!

235
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,260
From the window again...

236
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,180
We'll lend you a hand with that mission.

237
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,640
What?

238
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,980
We're not interested in all the military troubles,

239
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,570
but if it's about Homunculi or immortality, we can talk.

240
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:09,360
Huh? Are you doubting us?

241
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:13,830
We're grateful you rescued Second Lieutenant Ross, but-

242
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,990
The more people by your side, the better, right?

243
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,540
We're serious, too.

244
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,290
The fate of an entire clan rests on me.

245
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,050
Fine.

246
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,760
You'd better not run off with the Homunculi.

247
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:36,310
We'll keep our promise! We owe you for a meal, after all.

248
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,520
A meal?

249
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,940
Room service?

250
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,650
This place has great food!

251
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,190
"A meal" my ass!

252
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,110
Shut up!!!

253
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,240
I need to get up early tomorrow,
but I can't sleep with all this noise!

254
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:56,410
Oh, that's right. So you're going back to Rush Valley tomo-

255
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,080
Wait, cancel the trip and stay in Central for a little longer.

256
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,830
What?

257
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,630
Well, you know. How should I put this?

258
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:11,840
My arm may break again, or more accurately... it's definitely going to break again...

259
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,640
You're planning to break it now?!

260
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,140
Oh no! Brother's soul!

261
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,350
Geez...

262
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,270
Don't do anything too dangerous, okay?

263
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,070
Doctor! Doctor!

264
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,450
Are you not in?

265
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,630
Dammit!

266
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,260
I see... Nice try, nonetheless.

267
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,430
A deadlock, huh...

268
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,480
Well, if you'll excuse me.

269
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,530
Who were they?

270
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:13,400
My mother and someone from the Department of Veteran Affairs.

271
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,620
I've completed the retirement procedures.

272
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:21,790
It hasn't been determined if you'll be able to recover, yet...

273
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:25,540
I'm not so stupid as to not understand I'm useless now.

274
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,330
But...

275
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,920
You don't need a chess piece that can't move, right?

276
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,430
You have no idea how pathetic of a look you have right now...

277
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,890
Leave me behind! Throw me away!

278
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,520
Do you have time to be worrying about an underling like me?!

279
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,390
Don't you have a promise to keep with Brigadier General Hughes?!

280
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,230
I don't need your sympathy!

281
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,230
Second Lieutenant Havoc!

282
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,070
Let me give it up.

283
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,070
I'm begging you...

284
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,580
All right.

285
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,500
I'll leave you behind.

286
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,300
I'll leave you behind, so you'd better catch up to me.

287
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,010
I'm going on ahead.

288
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,890
I'll be waiting for you at the top.

289
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:32,400
He didn't even abandon me;
someone who tried to accept death.

290
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,440
He told me he'd rely on me to watch his back.

291
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,360
He can't throw his men away.

292
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,240
He's an idiot...

293
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:46,250
There's no way he can reach the top of this country with a soft attitude like that...

294
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,130
I think it's better for everyone
if an idiot like that exists among us.

295
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,050
Bring my uniform.

296
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,640
You're in no condition to be discharged from the hospital...

297
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,140
Don't make me repeat myself.

298
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:10,940
Yes, sir.

299
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,480
Look at what you've done!

300
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,570
I-I'm sorry!

301
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,120
I guess we have to close down for today!

302
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,580
Looks like you guys are in trouble!

303
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:30,370
State Alchemist, Edward Elric, to the rescue!

304
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,880
That was amazing, kid!

305
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,420
Thank you so much! How much should I pay you?

306
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,590
Pay?

307
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,930
There's absolutely no need for that!

308
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:48,140
I broke a precious jar. Could I ask you to fix it?

309
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,810
No problem at all!

310
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,950
Edward Elric!

311
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:07,490
I'm Edward Elric, your city's State Alchemist!

312
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,290
This, too!

313
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,450
Please fix it!

314
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,960
The whole city is talking about me.

315
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,130
With that flashiness, it's no surprise.

316
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,840
I wouldn't have expected things like this from you, Fullmetal.

317
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,090
Colonel?!

318
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:27,310
You're well enough to leave the hospital already?

319
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,430
I guess.

320
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,140
I heard about Second Lieutenant Havoc.

321
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,770
If you ask Dr. Marcoh, he can probably...

322
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:34,400
Hold that thought.

323
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:36,690
We're in public.

324
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,520
Get in.

325
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,280
On second thought, get out...

326
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,910
Dr. Marcoh is missing?!

327
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,620
He was probably abducted by them.

328
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,580
By the way, Fullmetal.

329
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,040
You've heard about Scar, right?

330
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:58,290
Why are you doing things that will just catch his eye?

331
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,050
I want him to find me.

332
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:04,720
I need to fight him again.

333
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,140
Don't be stupid!

334
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,890
Did you forget what happened to you in East City?!

335
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:12,270
Oh my! Afraid of Scar now, are we?

336
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:16,940
You were pretty much useless
last time, if I remember correctly!

337
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,860
Don't underestimate me! The weather's fine today!

338
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:23,030
On top of that, you're exhausted!

339
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,490
You really are useless, aren't you?!

340
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:25,410
Shut up!

341
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,660
Now look! He's here!

342
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,660
What's wrong? It's not even raining, but you look pretty drenched.

343
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,710
Hang on, Lieutenant!

344
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:37,790
Don't shoot.

345
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,960
What are you saying?!

346
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,050
I just thought I'd try fishing like the Colonel likes to.

347
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,390
We're going to drag out the Homunculi, using Brother as bait!

348
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:56,600
Since Brother is an important sacrifice and they want him alive!

349
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,190
This is reckless...

350
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,520
We don't want any more casualties!

351
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,030
So either me or Brother have to be the bait!

352
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:09,700
What if Scar gets shot to death by the
military police before the Homunculi come out?

353
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,330
You can take care of that, right, Colonel?

354
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,710
Ordering me about now, are we?

355
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,080
You've got some guts.

356
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,290
If you do capture the Homunculi, give me a crack at them!

357
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,000
Roger!

358
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,140
Sergeant Fuery's second home is nearby.

359
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,140
Let's go!

360
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,260
Roger.

361
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,140
It's begun.

362
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,690
You two! Please back away!

363
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,200
Don't shoot! You'll hit Brother!

364
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:51,660
Dammit... if Scar gets shot, it's all over!

365
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,740
Not being too close or too far is a pain!

366
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,870
When are you going to get here, Homunculus?!

367
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,870
The channel for the military police headquarters is...

368
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,500
Got it.

369
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,290
Nothing less to be expected from Fuery.

370
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,260
3rd District Military police unit reporting.

371
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,130
We are currently fighting Scar.

372
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,640
Requesting reinforcements immediately!

373
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,390
Y-You! What... are you doing?!

374
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,520
All right, the 17th district next.

375
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,770
This is getting kind of fun.

376
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,390
This is-

377
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,350
What the hell is going on?!

378
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,110
Scar is in the 17th district, too?!

379
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,770
Then what was with the 3rd district?!

380
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:27,650
Colonel Douglas! He's shown himself in 8th district, as well!

381
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,320
What?!

382
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,780
This is the Central military police headquarters, reporting to the 8th district.

383
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,410
Scar and a boy are engaged in combat!

384
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,370
The boy is a State Alchemist.

385
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,410
Do not shoot.

386
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,210
There are false reports all over the place!

387
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,920
A fourth Scar?! What the hell?!

388
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,210
This is the 3rd district! Everything is in order!

389
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:46,500
This is the 8th district! We've found Scar! Requesting reinforcements immediately!

390
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,340
Gluttony.

391
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,510
I can smell it. I can smell him!

392
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,520
The scent of that Ishbalan!

393
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,940
I sense something... Did you, Ran Fan?

394
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,770
Yes.

395
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,020
All right, let's go!

396
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,860
Which is he after?!

397
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,320
Human destruction or my automail?!

398
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,490
Brother!

399
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,330
I got lucky...

400
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,170
He canceled out the decomposition energy?!

401
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,750
So reckless...

402
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,300
Tattoos on his right arm!

403
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,430
Bastard...

404
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,050
So it was you!

405
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:37,100
I can smell it. I can smell him!

406
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,310
Hey, how's it going?

407
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,520
You have a strange interior.

408
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,030
How many people do you have inside you?

409
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,320
Who?

410
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,610
There's no point in trying to run.

411
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:57,990
I can sense your distinct aura from a mile away!

412
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,870
Enemy? Enemy?

413
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:04,170
Can I eat you?

414
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,250
As I thought!

415
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,000
A Homunculus!

416
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,500
Oh? You can sense us?

417
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,470
A troublesome ability.

418
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,600
I'll eliminate you!

419
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:20,600
Ran Fan!

420
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,140
Run!

421
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,150
Ran Fan!!!

422
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:37,380
I don't have to act tough, right?

423
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:37,380
Tsuyogaranakute iindane

424
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:44,180
The scribbling someone made...

425
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:44,180
Dareka ga kaitetta

426
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:49,980
On the wall, of a flower is swaying.

427
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:49,980
Kabe no rakugaki no hana ga yureru

428
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,560
No one knows their true selves.

429
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,560
Jibunrashisa nante dermo wakaranaiyo

430
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,860
Even though we both lose and gain

431
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,860
Nagai nagai michi no tochuu de

432
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,280
By embarking on this long, long path,

433
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,280
Nakushitari hirottari

434
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:08,950
And though there may be days loneliness strikes and makes us weep...

435
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:08,950
Kyuu ni samishikunatte naichau hi mo arukedo

436
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:16,460
Let's transform our tears and pains to stars.

437
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:16,460
Namida mo itami mo hoshi ni kaeyou

438
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:22,460
Let's light a candle to illuminate our tomorrow.

439
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:22,460
Ashita wo terasu akari wo tomosou

440
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,590
And we'll hold our small hands over the fire to create stardust,

441
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,590
Chiisana te kazashite futari de tsukurou

442
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:32,810
And an eternity that shines so brilliantly.

443
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:32,810
Hoshikuzu wo tsuyoku hikaru eien wo

444
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:38,190
Farewells may be unavoidable,

445
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:38,190
Sayonara itsuka wa kurukamoshirenai

446
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:44,110
Yet the seasons continue to change obliviously.

447
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:44,110
Kisetsu wa soredemo meguri megutteku

448
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,200
Even if I lose myself, I'll continue to walk...

449
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,200
Chiisaku mayottemo aruiteku

450
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,240
Walk by your side.

451
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,240
Kimi to aruiteku

452
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,540
That's the only thing I'd like to never change.

453
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,540
Sore dake wa kawaranaideiyoune

454
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,520
The shriek of the hurt girl echoes throughout Central.

455
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:08,360
When the trampling force meets his past again,

456
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,690
memories of violence are awakened.

457
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:16,530
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

458
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:20,290
Backs in the Distance

459
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:20,290
Episode 22, Backs in the Distance.

460
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,450
"I want to protect her."

461
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,790
That was the thought in the boy's mind.
