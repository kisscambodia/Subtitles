1
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:23,460
We sigh whenever we're about to come to a standstill

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:23,460
Owarinaki tabi no tochuu tachidomarisouna toki

3
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,710
While moving on this endless journey.

4
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,710
Fukai tameiki kobosu bokura wa

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,430
Everytime we lunge for it, it escapes and flies off.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,430
Tsukamikaketewa mata hanareteitta

7
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,850
But now, there's nothing to be afraid of

8
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,850
Demo ima wa mou nanimo osoreru koto wa nai

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,780
The powerful ties that bind our hearts

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,780
Kokoro wo tsunagu tsuyoi kizuna wa

11
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,240
Will never come loose.

12
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,240
Keshite hodoke wa shinai sa

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,960
After a lifetime of searching, we finally arrived

14
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,960
Sagashitsuzukete tadoritsuita

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,760
Here, where the period lies.

16
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,760
Kono basho de piriodo ni

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:23,060
Let's change all our sorrow and rage to power.

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:23,060
Kanashimi ikari chikara ni kaete

19
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,980
Destiny is right within our reach.

20
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,980
Unmei wa sugu soba ni

21
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,110
The forthcoming "Promised Day".

22
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:40,370
People are continuing to prepare for the day that will determine their fate.

23
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:46,040
Time passes by, and it is now spring.

24
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,290
At last, the Promised Day is about to arrive.

25
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,020
Looming Shadows

26
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,720
Some sort of festival?

27
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,100
It's the Festival of the Sheep, a local specialty of Resembool that takes place every spring.

28
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,850
Sorry to ask something like this on an important day, but we'd like to replenish our water supplies.

29
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:08,890
Sure thing.

30
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,270
Have all the water you want.

31
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,440
Okay! Bring out the water tanks!

32
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,110
One, two...

33
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,820
There.

34
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,800
Looks like there's no one home.

35
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,140
Here we are, miss.

36
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,530
Home sweet home.

37
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,330
Wow, this place is full of automails.

38
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,450
Please don't touch the ones that aren't finished yet.

39
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,970
It's so dusty in here...

40
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,280
What happened?!

41
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,570
Edward Elric?!

42
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,240
Intruders?!

43
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,290
Oww!!

44
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,790
What the hell are you guys doing?

45
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,960
Lin?!

46
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,170
If I recall, you two are working for Kimblee!

47
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:56,790
Huh?

48
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,670
You guys are... from Briggs!

49
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,130
You chased us all the way down here?!

50
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,930
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

51
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:06,680
Put down your guns!

52
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,180
Hey Ed... just what  is going on?

53
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,850
Long story.

54
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,440
Besides, what were you doing in my room?!

55
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,610
I just wanted to eat while enjoying the outside view every once in a while!

56
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,780
I said, put down your gun!

57
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,240
Quit yelling!

58
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,610
This dog is so loud.

59
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,660
Get the hell out of my room!!

60
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,300
You had me worried sick.

61
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,010
I know.

62
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,130
Glad to see you're safe.

63
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,100
A-Al isn't with you?

64
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,060
Al's at the station!

65
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,600
He's with Major Miles.

66
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,770
But they're about to depart soon.

67
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,610
If you hurry, you may be able to make it in time.

68
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,950
Something wrong?

69
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,660
Aren't you going to go see him?

70
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,950
We're fugitives wanted by Central.

71
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,250
It would be bad if someone were to see us.

72
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,420
But...

73
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,260
The Festival of the Sheep, huh...

74
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,310
Sure brings back memories.

75
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,100
We're going to be departing soon.

76
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,440
Roger.

77
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:47,950
I hope you will have found your body by the next time you return to this town.

78
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,030
Thank you.

79
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,880
Winry?

80
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,470
Welcome home.

81
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,220
Thanks.

82
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,060
Sorry for worrying you.

83
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,110
Looks like we have more of you dowdy people in here now.

84
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,530
Sorry for causing such a ruckus earlier.

85
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,570
We're soldiers from Briggs.

86
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,280
We were dispatched as Miss Winry's bodyguards.

87
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,950
You're Lin... right?

88
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:35,990
What?

89
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,950
You know this dude?

90
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,920
The name's Greed.

91
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,960
Nice to meet ya.

92
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,590
Huh?

93
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,600
And so, these guys are currently working for me.

94
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,350
What made you come here?

95
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,770
To make sure his automail's all tuned up and stuff.

96
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,230
You know, to prepare for the worst.

97
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,810
Take a look at him later, Winry.

98
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,490
You made all his latest stuff, so I can't do the fine-tuning.

99
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,990
Sure, no problem.

100
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,410
Oh...

101
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,420
So the people of Lior have gotten back up on their feet again.

102
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,580
That's a relief.

103
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,040
It's been bugging me, to tell you the truth.

104
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,930
So, why is Al with Major Miles?

105
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:36,970
I heard the people from Briggs are going to do something at the joint exercises in the east.

106
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:41,180
Al volunteered to join them, saying there might be something he could help out with.

107
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,350
Oh...

108
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:48,280
Your dad went to Central ahead of him.

109
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:53,910
I heard he's in some slum called 'Kanama', so you should meet up with him to get the details.

110
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,000
The Promised Day is coming up... right?

111
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,750
I heard about that from Greed as well.

112
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:13,800
It's a day when we may be able to get our bodies back,
or a day when a great tragedy will strike this nation.

113
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,140
Hey...

114
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,310
Yeah?

115
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,690
Take Granny and Den and escape to another country.

116
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,650
Are you telling me to run away?!

117
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,480
Telling those close to you to escape makes it sound like you've already given up!

118
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,950
Can't you stop the threat to this country?!

119
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,570
I'll stop them!

120
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,070
But there's a one in a million chance that it may not work!

121
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,330
Be 100% sure, then!

122
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,620
They're planning to do something terrible, aren't they?!

123
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,330
Beat them to a pulp and protect our country!

124
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:52,300
And while you're at it, get your bodies back and return safe and sound!

125
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,840
I'll do anything  to make that happen!

126
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,480
Geez, you make it sound like a walk in the park.

127
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,680
What's this?!

128
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,100
You're not acting like yourself-

129
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:08,860
Hey, Ed!

130
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,690
Gosh, you're such an annoying woman.

131
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,690
Ed!

132
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,250
Fine woman you have up there.

133
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,500
She just sounds like she wants everything
in the world. Quite the greedy one.

134
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,290
When you get too greedy, it comes back to bite you in the behind.

135
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:32,880
See this?

136
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,920
I wanted to bring back the dead, and this was my reward.

137
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,260
You really think so?

138
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:43,720
"I long to see someone who died",
"I want to be rich", "I want women"...

139
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,930
"I want to protect the world"...

140
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,020
They're all desires.

141
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,270
In other words, wishes.

142
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,110
If you ask me, there's neither 'right' nor 'wrong' when it comes to greed.

143
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:01,240
You humans go around ranking certain types of greed in order from good to bad, which makes you so hard to understand.

144
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,670
You're leaving now  of all times?

145
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:16,800
We were planning on leaving today anyway.

146
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,800
Thanks for the tune-up.

147
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:28,770
If you ever happen to see Hohenheim, deliver Trisha's message for her.

148
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,730
Sure, whatever.

149
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,270
Ed! I...

150
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,730
You stay hidden.

151
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,530
I'll come home after putting an end to everything on the Promised Day, so...

152
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,280
...wait for us with a freshly-baked apple pie. Deal?

153
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,120
Deal!

154
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,010
Work today took forever.

155
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,470
But hey, is this really what we should be focusing on right now?

156
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,640
The Promised Day is coming up!

157
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,350
Not much else we can do!

158
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,850
Doctor Marcoh and Scar haven't met up with us yet!

159
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,190
Geez... where the hell are they?!

160
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,490
Doctor!

161
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,940
Hey, it's you guys.

162
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,450
"Hey, it's you guys"?!

163
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,450
Where have you two been all this time?!

164
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,450
Sorry about that.

165
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,330
Let's head over to Central.

166
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,540
But something feels a little off.

167
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:40,590
We used to be soldiers, but now we're working with an Ishbalan.

168
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,880
Yeah it does.

169
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:46,100
For us, Amestris is our birthplace.

170
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,560
We've got family here as well.

171
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:55,150
But Scar, who used to rebel against the nation, is now working to protect it.

172
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,900
Don't get the wrong idea.

173
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,110
My goal is not to protect this country.

174
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,070
I'm working to change it.

175
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:05,950
I'm working in order for the people of this country to recognize the existence of the Ishbalans,

176
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,990
a race that they denied.

177
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:15,000
In order to change the world,
you must start by changing yourself.

178
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,500
That's how it is, Amestrians.

179
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,050
Ishbalans?!

180
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:21,970
Why?!

181
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:26,760
We weren't just dawdling about for months doing nothing.

182
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,770
They're comrades who share our goal.

183
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,530
May this year's exercises be productive as always, Lieutenant General.

184
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,160
I'm glad we're doing it in the east this year.

185
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,620
Joint exercises in the north are pretty tough for us.

186
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,550
Everything's ready on our end.

187
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,970
Ours, too.

188
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,600
Unfortunately, a little problem has popped up...

189
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,140
That being?

190
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,730
Little miss Bradley is here to observe as well.

191
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:29,490
I was expecting someone high up to watch over the practice, since it's right before the Promised Day...

192
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,870
We'll just have to figure something out.

193
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,220
There it is again...

194
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:02,820
The delay between visions is gradually getting shorter.

195
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,240
I have to hurry.

196
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,780
I need to get my body back, or...

197
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,460
Yeah, I can smell him!

198
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,010
Smells like the Fullmetal Alchemist's little brother!

199
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,010
Running away?

200
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,390
This isn't good!

201
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,520
I'm in no condition to fight!

202
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,000
What's... this...?!

203
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,920
Talk about great timing...!

204
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:22,900
I'm going to have you keep quiet until the Promised Day,

205
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,480
Alphonse Elric.

206
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,630
Good evening, Major General.

207
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,590
I've got no tea for the likes of you.

208
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:59,470
I may be able to take you out for dinner soon.

209
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,270
So you finally plan to fulfill the promise from forever ago?

210
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:11,280
'Large' doesn't even begin to describe this mansion.
The wealth of the Armstrong family never ceases to amaze me.

211
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,280
You could fit a company... no, even a full battalion in here.

212
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,290
If something may happen to me,

213
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,500
you can have the entire mansion.

214
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,750
It won't fit into my coffin, after all.

215
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,130
You're not going to give it to your brother?

216
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:38,680
I'd say you're the better choice... by a hair.

217
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,560
That's quite an honor.

218
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,600
Belatedly...

219
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,940
This is to congratulate you for becoming the head of the Armstrong family.

220
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,610
Hyacinths...?

221
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:04,000
"Selim Bradley is a Homunculus."

222
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,090
Are you aware of what the Hyacinth represents?

223
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,960
I'm not.

224
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,380
Feminine beauty.

225
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,100
I don't need your flowers!

226
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,180
Well, if you'll excuse me, Major General.

227
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,150
You amateur.

228
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,720
One Day Prior to the "Promised Day"

229
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,700
One Day Prior to the "Promised Day"

230
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,210
This is annoying.

231
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:57,340
We should just aim a cannon at Bradley's tower and be done with it.

232
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,590
Please don't.

233
00:17:58,970 --> 00:17:59,930
Major Miles.

234
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,430
So we still don't have a clue as to where Alphonse Elric disappeared to...

235
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:08,600
Yes. We're still searching, but...

236
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,610
Could it be that he was captured?

237
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,690
And the Promised Day is tomorrow...

238
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,700
Sire.

239
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,740
Major General Hakuro has arrived.

240
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,710
Sire, there's something I need to inform you about Lieutenant General Grumman-

241
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:30,250
A coup d'etat using the Eastern army?

242
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,250
We've already planned for such eventualities.

243
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:37,760
No, the joint practice is a bait.

244
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:42,510
The Ishbalan remnants will commit a terrorist act in Central,

245
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,760
now that defenses have weakened since Your Highness is here in the east.

246
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:51,230
Lieutenant General Grumman will use "terrorist suppression" as a pretense to invade Central.

247
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,770
He's planning on taking advantage of the confusion to take over Central Headquarters,

248
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,400
with the help of Colonel Mustang.

249
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,960
Just as Major General Hakuro stated,

250
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,250
many Ishbalans have infiltrated Central vicinity over the past few days.

251
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,720
I'm returning to Central.

252
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,140
I'll leave matters here in your hands.

253
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,310
Roger.

254
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,440
That damned Mustang... planning something outrageous.

255
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:42,990
I thought we took care of him when we
separated him from all of his useful men...

256
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,750
The train stopped.

257
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,500
What's going on?

258
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,920
Sheep crossing.

259
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,840
Dammit, we're in a rush for time...!

260
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:14,400
Hey, they just left us!

261
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,270
What?!

262
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,520
What's going on?!

263
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,270
Hey! Make him stop!

264
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:39,130
The sheep on the tracks have been exterminated.

265
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,710
We'll be heading to Central as planned.

266
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,930
Let's go!

267
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,220
The Colonel is awaiting our arrival.

268
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,390
Yes, sir!

269
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,760
Dammit!

270
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:54,230
You played right into their hands, Major General Hakuro.

271
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:59,570
The train that was carrying the Führer President has been bombed!

272
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:00,440
What?!

273
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,120
Everything begins tomorrow.

274
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,830
Time to make our move,

275
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,340
Second Lieutenant Breda, Master Sergeant Fuery.

276
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,760
No need for the "Second Lieutenant", ma'am.

277
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,260
We're just plain old deserters now.

278
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,930
There goes my future...

279
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:34,520
We'll have the Colonel take responsibility after everything's over.

280
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:57,290
The promise we never made

281
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:57,290
Kawashita hazu no nai yakasoku ga

282
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,080
yet again

283
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,080
Kyou mo

284
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,920
tries to snatch our future away from us.

285
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,920
Bokura no mirai wo ubaou to suru

286
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:08,510
Why is it that we can't rejoice

287
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:08,510
Hoshigatteita mono wo te ni shitemo

288
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,510
straight from the heart

289
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,510
Sunao ni

290
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:14,470
when we obtain something we've always been after?

291
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:14,470
Umaku waraenai nowa nazedarou

292
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:20,190
The overflowing tears aren't from feebleness or remorse.

293
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:20,190
Afureru namida wo yowasa ya koukai ja nai

294
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,980
Itami ga unda kakera de

295
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,980
They're fragments born from agony.

296
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:30,030
Of all the moments and destinies,

297
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:30,030
Donna shunkan datte unmei datte

298
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:38,790
I realized there's one absolute certainty.

299
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:38,790
Hitotsu dake tashika na mono ga aru to shitta

300
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,330
Even if things get tough and I'm at my limit

301
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,330
Genkai datte konnan datte

302
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:45,340
I refuse to give up.

303
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:45,340
Akirametakunaiyo

304
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:50,220
Konomama hanasanaide

305
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:50,220
Please, don't let go.

306
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:58,060
I can feel the warmth of your right hand

307
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:58,060
Kataku nigirishimeta kimi no migite no nukumori

308
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,730
where it's tightly joined with my left.

309
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,730
Koko ni arukara

310
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,070
The Führer President?!

311
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,530
There's no way King Bradley could die...!

312
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,200
We can't make assumptions just yet!

313
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,790
What has the investigation turned up?!

314
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,660
The squadron has yet to reach the scene of the accident!

315
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,120
As soon as their leader is gone, this happens.

316
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,080
Make them hurry up!

317
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,120
Quit yelling!

318
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,630
PLACEHOLDER

319
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,750
This is not my job!

320
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,790
In the end, they're nothing but an undisciplined mob.

321
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,590
But...!

322
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,960
This isn't the time for this!

323
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,300
PLACEHOLDER

324
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,260
The supreme commander is missing!

325
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,420
I know that!

326
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,970
This may be my chance...

327
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,020
I never expected someone as important as you to visit this place.

328
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,560
Calm down, everyone.

329
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:53,280
I'm still here.

330
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,250
What lurks in the shadows?

331
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,960
Demons? Beasts? Monsters?

332
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:10,210
A black gust of wind saves our heroes who are faced with a crisis.

333
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:15,720
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

334
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,750
Episode 47, Emissary of Darkness.

335
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:19,750
Emissary of Darkness

336
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:25,310
Shed light on the heart of man. To an engulfing darkness.
