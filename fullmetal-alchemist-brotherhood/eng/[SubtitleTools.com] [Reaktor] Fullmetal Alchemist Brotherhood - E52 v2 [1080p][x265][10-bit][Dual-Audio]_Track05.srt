1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,150
The new morning we've finally found

2
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,150
Yatto mitsuketa atarashii asa wa

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,190
is being hampered by the past.

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,190
Tsukihi ga jama wo suru

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,660
What we chased after wasn't the future,

6
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,660
Mukau saki wa tsugi ja nakute

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,490
but the past so full of remorse.

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,490
Sugi bakari oikaketa

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,960
Nariyamanai yousha nai omoide tachi wa

10
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,960
The ruthless memories won't stop playing;

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,050
they won't be forgiving us for a long time.

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,050
Yurushite kuresou nimonai

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,890
It's about now that a teardrop

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,890
Sorosoro kana tesaguri tsukareta hoho wo

15
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,560
beings to roll down my fatigued cheeks.

16
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,560
Kattou ga koboreochiru

17
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,810
Will this rain ever stop?

18
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,810
Ame wa itsuka yamunodeshouka

19
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:52,030
I've been freezing for a long time.

20
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:52,030
Zuibun nagai aida tsumetai

21
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,320
Why does the rain continue to fix on me?

22
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,320
Ame wa doushite boku wo erabuno

23
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,080
I wonder if it could embrace me.

24
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,080
Tsutsumarete iikana

25
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,870
Today, the rain falls again;

26
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,870
Ame wa yamu koto wo shirazuni

27
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,090
Kyou mo furitsuzukukeredo

28
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,090
endlessly it falls knowing no end.

29
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,130
We nestle close to each other to share the warmth

30
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,130
Sotto sashidashita kasa no naka de

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:28,850
under this umbrella, you gently held out to me.

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:28,850
Nukumori ni yorisoinagara

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Combined Strength

34
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,320
A philosopher's stone!

35
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,780
Where did he get that?!

36
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,790
Smoke screening again?

37
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,710
Like I'll fall for that again!

38
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,840
A flash bang?!

39
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,390
That one was a decoy!

40
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,890
Nothing less to be expected from the power of a philosopher's stone.

41
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,390
One transmutation after another...!

42
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,430
You...!

43
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:05,450
The power of a philosopher's stone never ceases to amaze me.

44
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:09,710
I've used it before, so I know.

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,080
And that's why I'm confused about something.

46
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:18,760
Why don't you use that power to get your body back?

47
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,300
Since you have the stone, it'll be easy to run from us.

48
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,930
Once you get away, you can use the power to get you and your brother's bodies back.

49
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,650
And doesn't that conclude your journey?

50
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,230
If we did that, we wouldn't be able to save everyone.

51
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,860
It's to fulfill your dearest wish.

52
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,950
In order to gain something, one must sacrifice.

53
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,990
Hey,

54
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,370
why are you saying there are only two options?

55
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,420
Getting our bodies back, or saving everyone.

56
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,630
It's strange to think that only one of those can be granted.

57
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:07,680
Why don't you consider the possibility of getting our bodies back, and at the same time, saving everyone?

58
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,270
What about the law of equivalent exchange?

59
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:19,650
I think that in order for humanity to progress, we must seek a possibility without being bound by principles.

60
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,150
I see.

61
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:28,580
If that comes true, it'll be recognized by the world as a new principle.

62
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,200
Right?

63
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,750
Then you should prepare another possibility.

64
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:45,130
The possibility of the two of you not getting your bodies back, and not being able to save anyone either.

65
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,280
There's more on the way!

66
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,120
Okay! We can at least pierce his skin!

67
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,340
That hurt...

68
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,260
I'm gonna die...

69
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,220
This is such a drag...

70
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,010
Dying is such a drag...

71
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,100
Such a drag...

72
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,060
It's going to be such a drag...

73
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,110
...to have to go all out...

74
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:42,980
What?!

75
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,900
Major General Armstrong!

76
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,860
Put down your weapons!

77
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,120
What the hell is that giant?!

78
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,800
That was...!

79
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
Yeah.

80
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,810
I... missed...

81
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,900
W-What speed...!

82
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,110
Sloth the Lazy.

83
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,860
Sister!

84
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,200
Just barely grazed.

85
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,200
Did you see that?

86
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,290
Only slightly.

87
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,830
Moving at that speed while weighing so much...

88
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,580
It's almost unfair.

89
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,170
Yeah, I'm...

90
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,090
...the fastest Homunculus.

91
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,430
Alex!

92
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,310
I think... he's so fast that he can't even control his direction.

93
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:00,810
Shit-

94
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,320
Finally... I hit.

95
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,460
What a beautiful sound.

96
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:26,130
The clashing of strong wills produces the most beautiful of sounds.

97
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,970
Alphonse Elric is still nearby.

98
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,510
I'm sure of it.

99
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,930
He won't die that easy.

100
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,520
Right there!

101
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,200
That again? How unexciting.

102
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,040
It's futile.

103
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:12,010
I told you, I can sense where you are by smell.

104
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,640
Checkmate.

105
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,680
I wouldn't be so sure.

106
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,930
This is where the tenacity of humans comes in!

107
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,060
Even if you have a philosopher's stone,

108
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,150
there's no way you can beat us on your own-

109
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,190
I'm not on my own!

110
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,820
Where did you hide the stone?!

111
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,160
It couldn't be...

112
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,080
The motive behind this cloud of dust is...

113
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,080
...to know the direction of the wind?

114
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:51,260
He must have something up his sleeve within the leeward where my sense of smell is useless...

115
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,050
Behind me?!

116
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,600
It can't be...!

117
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,600
How can he move with that wound...?!

118
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,240
Doctor Marcoh!

119
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,540
An ice cream truck, right?

120
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,670
Yeah. Don't miss it.

121
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,340
Right.

122
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:37,380
Alchemy is so useful, isn't it?

123
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,760
It's a simple matter to change the appearance of a motor vehicle.

124
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,730
We can't go in through here either.

125
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,900
All the gates that allow entry into the Central Headquarters have been sealed off.

126
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:53,820
What should we do?

127
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,190
Force our way through?

128
00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:00,780
No, leave the rough jobs up to the Briggs soldiers.

129
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,410
We'll use an underground route.

130
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,200
Roger.

131
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,460
We're going to split up now.

132
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:10,380
I want you all to accompany the madam and head to the location.

133
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,630
Roger.

134
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,440
Good thing I'm meaty.

135
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,070
Can't underestimate the power of a philosopher's stone, I guess.

136
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,950
Their legs!

137
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,240
Aim for their legs!

138
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,800
What?!

139
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,640
Alex!

140
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,930
Just a minor dislocated joint.

141
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,770
What about you, Sister?

142
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,690
Just a broken bone or two.

143
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,840
Sister!

144
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,890
I want to hurry up and kill you...

145
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,310
...so I can nap.

146
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,700
He stopped?!

147
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,120
He's hesitant to stab Kimblee?

148
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,500
But why would someone like him...

149
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,340
I see now.

150
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,590
Just as you said, humans are tenacious.

151
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:08,430
However, you all won't be able to beat us.

152
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,770
As long as...

153
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:15,020
...our father is seated right over there.

154
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:27,200
Well, before that, you all need to find a way to get out of this situation.

155
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:40,960
Who?!

156
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,180
I did it...

157
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,680
I sure did it!

158
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,680
Yoki?!

159
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,430
Nice one, mustache man!

160
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:59,190
I didn't expect you  to show up!

161
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,770
I can't let you guys have all the spotlight!

162
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,570
Let me show off too, geez!

163
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,150
Did you see that?!

164
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:09,570
I, Yoki, gave the strongest Homunculus a good beatdown!

165
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,950
You saw it!

166
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,370
Where did you get this car?!

167
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,910
It's the one Kimblee rode here in.

168
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,790
I'm having the drivers take a little break.

169
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,920
Not bad, Doctor Marcoh.

170
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,760
Step on it!

171
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,740
Shut up and drive!

172
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,280
Drive as fast as you can!

173
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,950
I don't plan on fighting that monster head-on again!

174
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,620
Drive to Central!

175
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:59,790
We need to meet up with Ed and the others and defeat Father before that thing catches up with us!

176
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,300
Brave humans sure are easy to trick.

177
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,320
Oh good, you're still alive.

178
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:34,160
I like the new color of your suit, Kimblee.

179
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,160
Now I know why they call lions the "king of beasts".

180
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,330
Obeying the rule of "survival of the fittest",

181
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,790
he gouged out your throat.

182
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:52,880
I guess humans really are of no importance to this world.

183
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:08,820
You were saying something about wanting to see what option this world would choose, right?

184
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:16,740
It would be a disgrace if you were to just die here like this.

185
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,210
But don't worry.

186
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,050
You're going to continue to live inside me.

187
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,070
What... happened...?

188
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,330
Alex!

189
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:10,920
Since he rushes at you on his own, all you have to do is wait for him.

190
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,600
Can you stand, Sister?

191
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:26,730
Now that I recall, a shoot-on-sight order has been issued for me.

192
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,940
What?!

193
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,440
That won't do!

194
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,440
I'm going to inherit the Armstrong household,

195
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,360
so I can't have you die until you complete the formalities!

196
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,070
You don't need to worry about that.

197
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:41,030
I've made it so that the mansion will go to Mustang if I were to die.

198
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,950
You made a promise like that without even discussing it with your family?!

199
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:48,500
He's better than a failure like you by a hair.

200
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,960
Is that how you're supposed to treat someone who came to your rescue?!

201
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,970
What's... going on?

202
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,140
Enemy raid?

203
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,140
Don't tell me... it's Mustang's squad?!

204
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,720
W-What the hell?!

205
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,140
Shooting them doesn't do a thing!

206
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,310
Are they soldiers from Briggs?!

207
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,310
Moron!

208
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:53,480
Don't confuse my burly men with those scrawny blue monsters!

209
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,570
They're probably the same kind of thing as this is.

210
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:01,240
The one who commanded you fools is probably behind it.

211
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:05,040
We were never told of this!

212
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:10,170
I don't think they care whether or not you were told.

213
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,420
What will you do?

214
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:22,220
Us siblings can fight those monsters.

215
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,760
But...

216
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,790
So, what will you do?!

217
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,960
Are you going to kill us and end up being eaten by monsters,

218
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,170
or will you cooperate with us to destroy those fiends?!

219
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,680
Learn to think for yourself!

220
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,180
You!

221
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:15,900
Again?!

222
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,660
It's no use.

223
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,710
They're soldier dolls that were injected with philosopher's stones.

224
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,130
It'll take more than that to kill them!

225
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,340
See? Look at that.

226
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:51,470
I got stronger by absorbing them because you keep dodging my attacks.

227
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,310
You don't get it at all.

228
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:00,730
It would be troublesome if those dolls were to all rush at me,

229
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,240
but it's simple as pie to run away if it's only you chasing me!

230
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,490
Bullshit!

231
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,500
These dolls have been injected with philosopher's stones.

232
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,960
That's why they won't die.

233
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,040
So the secret to immortality really is in those stones...?

234
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,710
It's to save my clan!

235
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,970
I need to obtain the secret to immortality!

236
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,180
It hurts...

237
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,690
Pain...

238
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,770
There's still  more of them?!

239
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,190
There's no end to them!

240
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,620
I'm almost out of stings!

241
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,330
I'm just about out of saliva as well.

242
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,880
Dammit!

243
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,750
Shit!

244
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:04,710
Ed!

245
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:17,140
It's always so unruly wherever I find you.

246
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,690
Shall I lend you a hand,

247
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:25,780
Fullmetal?

248
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:41,760
Ever since that day passed,

249
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:41,760
Ano hi kara zutto

250
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,010
I promised myself that I'd never cry.

251
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,010
Nakanaito kimetekitakedo

252
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:51,560
Itami wo kasanetemo

253
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:51,560
But even while I hoarded up the pain,

254
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:56,670
there was something I couldn't forgive myself for.

255
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:56,670
Nanika wo yurusezu ni ita

256
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,110
I'll never be able

257
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,110
Mou modorenai

258
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,610
to return to those days.

259
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,610
Ikutsumo no hibi

260
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:07,700
Boku wa mada nanimo dekizuni

261
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:07,700
I'm still powerless.

262
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:12,950
I watch as the shards of memories disappear, one by one;

263
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:12,950
Kimi no ita kioku no kakera

264
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:18,820
memories of when you were still with me.

265
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:18,820
Mata hitotsu kieteyuku

266
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,840
I long to become

267
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,840
Kyou yori motto

268
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,590
stronger than I am now,

269
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,590
Tsuyoku naritai

270
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:29,730
Kono koe ga itsuka todokuyouni

271
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:29,730
so that my voice will eventually reach you.

272
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:32,100
If the wind happens to stop

273
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:32,100
Arukitsuzukete

274
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,810
in the midst of my long journey,

275
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,810
Kaze ga yandara

276
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:39,520
I'll look up at the sky in search of you.

277
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:39,520
Kimi wo sagashite sora miageruyo

278
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:46,860
Beyond the daybreak, a ray of light breaks free.

279
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:46,860
Yoake no saki ni hikari ga sasuyo

280
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:52,410
A rainbow spans across the sky.

281
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:52,410
Niji ga kakaruyo

282
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,210
When people arrive at the truth,

283
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:06,340
they lay their hearts bare.

284
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:12,380
They are unable to stop themselves, nor do they have the luxury of choice.

285
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:17,760
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

286
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,780
Episode 53, Flame of Vengeance.

287
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,780
Flame of Vengeance

288
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:25,900
Reduce everything to ashes.
