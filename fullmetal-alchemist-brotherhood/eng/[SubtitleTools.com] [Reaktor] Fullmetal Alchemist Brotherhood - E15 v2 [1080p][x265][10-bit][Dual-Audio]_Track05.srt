1
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:15,990
You've got quite the nerve to pick a quarrel with me, Giolio Comanche, the Silver Alchemist.

2
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:16,950
However...

3
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,490
You're pretty good to get out of that with only a scratch.

4
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,830
Only a scratch?

5
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,180
Drawn by a landscape as white as snow,

6
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,180
Masshiro na keshiki ni ima sasowarete

7
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:29,730
I'm headed toward an unseen world.

8
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:29,730
Boku wa yuku yo mada minu sekai e

9
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,670
I've been traveling while lost

10
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,670
Maigo no mama tabi shiteita

11
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,460
Under this gray sky.

12
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,450
Nezumiiro no sora no shita

13
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,550
Every day with new maps, stained with my many dreams.

14
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,550
Higawari no chizu ikutsumo no yume ga nijindeita

15
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,940
I wonder if someday,

16
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,940
Itsuka wa sa

17
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,980
Even with these tiny steps of mine,

18
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,980
Chippoke na boku no kono hohaba demo

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,060
I'll be able to travel beyond those clouds.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,060
Ano kumo no mukou made yukeru kana

21
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,690
I put on a bold front.

22
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,690
Tsuyogatte

23
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,240
End up hurting myself.

24
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,240
Kizutsuita

25
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,320
I feel empty inside.

26
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,320
Kokoro sukashita youni

27
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,860
It's started to rain,

28
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,860
Furidashita

29
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,030
Amatsubu tachi ga

30
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,030
And the raindrops

31
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,250
Began to repeat their scattered reflections.

32
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,250
Ranhansha kurikaesu

33
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,120
These straight rays of light

34
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,120
Massugu na hikari ga

35
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,840
Start to cross one another.

36
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,840
Kousa shite

37
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,420
And without telling anyone where they're headed,

38
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,420
Yakusaki mo tsugenumama

39
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,710
Across the endless distances,

40
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,710
Doko made mo

41
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,300
They pass through all matter.

42
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,300
Tsukinukeru

43
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:31,130
Awai zanzou ryoume ni yakitsukete

44
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:31,130
I burn these faint afterimages onto my eyes.

45
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,050
Under this sky,

46
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,050
Kono sora no shita

47
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,880
Wherever I am,

48
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,880
Donna toko ni itemo

49
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,180
I should be able to reach

50
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,180
Todoku hazu nanda

51
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,990
The unseen world.

52
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,990
Mada minu sekai e

53
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,190
Who the hell is that?

54
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,150
Master, you're back!

55
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,910
I'm asking who the hell is that?!

56
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,620
Nice to meet you! I'm May Chang!

57
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,420
The Envoy from
the East

58
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:09,910
When I was unconscious on the roadside, I was saved by Sir Yoki, your master.

59
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,170
My master?

60
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,550
You're feeling better now, right? Then get out of here.

61
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:28,870
What do you want?

62
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,600
Allow me to seal your wound.

63
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,620
What?! It healed?!

64
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,620
It's called Eastern Alchemy, from the nation of Xing.

65
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,420
Xing?

66
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:59,220
Yeah! According to her, she crossed
the great desert of the east all by herself.

67
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,720
How stupid can you get?

68
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,600
I didn't cross it by myself!

69
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,100
I had a companion with me!

70
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,990
Companion? Oh, you mean that little thing?

71
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,230
Yes! Her name is Shao May!

72
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,690
This is... Eastern Alchemy, is it not?

73
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,280
A technique comprised of understanding and utilizing the veins of the dragon, power that runs through the earth...

74
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,950
This tattoo is used to draw power from our Eastern Alchemy.

75
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:38,190
My older brother studied both
Eastern Alchemy and Western Alchemy.

76
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,650
This tattoo is the outcome of his research.

77
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,300
Oh my! Your brother must be a really talented individual!

78
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,160
I have no idea what you two are talking about,

79
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,160
but since your wounds are all healed up, we can go back to Central now, right?

80
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,730
If that's the case, I'll get ready right away!

81
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,350
Hey! We told you to get out of here!

82
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,430
We're not going on a trip, you know!

83
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,120
I'm serious, too!

84
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,640
That immortal crap you were talking about earlier?

85
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,490
There's no way something like that could exist.

86
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,860
But it does! That's the reason why I-

87
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,420
Shut up! Brats like you should be on the playgr-

88
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,050
Immortality couldn't be achieved through Eastern Alchemy.

89
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,580
But maybe with its Western counterpart...

90
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:32,600
That's why I must meet that man I keep hearing stories about!

91
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,930
Blonde hair, golden eyes, wearing a red coat so elegantly...

92
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,860
A genius alchemist that saves people in a splendid manner...

93
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,240
Sir Edward Elric!

94
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,740
What should we do, Master?

95
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,520
I couldn't care less.

96
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,550
What's wrong, Black Hayate?

97
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,310
You don't want to be walking alone at this hour...

98
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,660
It's quite dangerous because...

99
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,650
...you could be attacked by me, Barry the Chopper!

100
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,830
What the hell was that for?!

101
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,790
Dammit! In that case...

102
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,710
...what do you think of this?!

103
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,890
W-Why aren't you shocked at all?

104
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,640
I know someone who's sort of like you.

105
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,850
Like me? Alphonse what's-his-name?

106
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,850
You know Alphonse?

107
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,860
So you're a friend of his, eh?

108
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,270
But I must say, lady...

109
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,410
...you're really strong!

110
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,120
The Philosopher's Stone.

111
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:17,100
I wouldn't have guessed
Research Laboratory 5 was involved in its refining.

112
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,290
There's a possibility the upper echelon of the military also has something to do with it.

113
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,630
And ones by the name of Lust and Envy...

114
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,050
Are they the ones who turned you into that?

115
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,740
No, this was done by the scientists.

116
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,810
They pulled my soul out of my body.

117
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:40,100
We might be able to find out who instructed
the experiments if we interrogate the scientists...

118
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,390
That can't be done.

119
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:47,280
None of them are left. They were also used as ingredients for the stone.

120
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,610
That way none of the information gets leaked. Two birds with one stone.

121
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:57,610
I wonder if this means they don't need to create any more stones?

122
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,290
Last question for you.

123
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:10,050
Are you the one who murdered the military officer about a month ago in a phone booth at Central?

124
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,800
I don't even know what you're talking about!

125
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,010
Was he cut up?

126
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,020
No...

127
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,010
I'll take your word for it.

128
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,270
Yo, Miss Winry!

129
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,190
How are you doing on this fine day?

130
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,110
Ed! Al!

131
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,870
What brings you here all of a sudden?

132
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,100
Geez...

133
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,340
Even Paninya has picked up a job and is working seriously...

134
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:48,840
Paninya?

135
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,500
Yup.

136
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:56,710
She stopped pickpocketing, and now she fixes roofs and does all sorts of high-altitude constructions.

137
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,110
Wow...

138
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,030
And what about you two?

139
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,600
Any progress at all?

140
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,440
Well, we're taking the long way, but...

141
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,860
We're slowly making our way... I guess.

142
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,950
Well, that's good to hear.

143
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,950
There! Temporary repairs complete.

144
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,320
Thanks, Winry!

145
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,960
I don't have enough parts right now to fix it up completely, so bear with that for now.

146
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,360
All right...

147
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,800
I'll go buy them right away, so could you go kill some time?

148
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,710
But what's there to do?

149
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,240
There are only automail shops here...

150
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:41,870
Al.

151
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,230
Brother...

152
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,900
What, did you find a cat or something?

153
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,160
Yeah.

154
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,670
I'm alive!

155
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,030
You guys saved my life! Thanks!

156
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,410
Oh, and thanks for the food!

157
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,860
Never said I'd pay for it.

158
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,910
Don't mind such a small thing!

159
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,910
Don't say small!

160
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,120
To be cared for in a foreign land... I'm so thankful.

161
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,630
"Foreign land"? Are you not from this country?

162
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,010
Yep! I came from Xing!

163
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,750
Xing...

164
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,780
That great nation to the east?

165
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:23,640
That's right! Crossing that desert felt like walking through hell...

166
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,000
But why did you take that route?

167
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,940
I wanted to see the Xerxes ruins.

168
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:31,940
Xerxes?

169
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,050
I heard there's nothing there.

170
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,790
Just a bit of research.

171
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,400
I came to this country for
Eastern Alchemy-related research, too.

172
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,700
Eastern Alchemy?

173
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,450
Oh right, you just call it alchemy in this country, don't you?

174
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,290
The alchemy in our country is a skill that is used predominantly for medical purposes.

175
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,960
Different customs, I guess.

176
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,720
It's mostly used for war in our country.

177
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:04,220
Skirmishes are still ongoing on the border with Aerugo to the south and Creta to the west.

178
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,980
And there's still the great nation of Drachma up north, too.

179
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:14,680
There is a non-aggression pact, but the only reason they don't bother to attack us is because Mt. Briggs is in the way.

180
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,490
Our relations aren't looking too good.

181
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:19,490
Such a scary country to be in...

182
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:25,240
This country's been so military-focused ever since King Bradley became the Führer President.

183
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,330
But I'm really curious.

184
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:32,060
About this Eastern Alchemy that's used for healing.

185
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,000
Me, too.

186
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:37,210
Oh, could you guys be alchemists?

187
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,190
Yeah.

188
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:42,730
I'm Edward Elric, a State Alchemist.

189
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,840
I'm his younger brother, Alphonse Elric.

190
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,010
Nice to meet you.

191
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,480
I'm Ling Yao!

192
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,730
The pleasure is mine.

193
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:54,520
Hey Ling, could you explain your Eastern Alchemy to us in detail?

194
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,700
Can't!

195
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,400
I'm not an alchemist.

196
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,810
What the hell did you come to research if you're not an alchemist?!

197
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,040
Just a little something.

198
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,160
You guys might know something about it...

199
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,790
The Philosopher's Stone.

200
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,290
I really want it...

201
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,900
Do you know anything about it?

202
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:20,720
Nope.

203
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,430
Can't say I do.

204
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,600
Seems like you do.

205
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,520
Care to tell me?

206
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,400
What do you plan to use it for?

207
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,390
To find the way to gain immortality.

208
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,580
Care to tell me?

209
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,910
Immortality? How stupid.

210
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,370
I'm totally serious.

211
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,790
Besides...

212
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,040
This doesn't seem like the right attitude to have...

213
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,590
...when asking for a favor!

214
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,180
Brother!

215
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,390
You're going to retaliate, too?!

216
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,640
H-Hey!

217
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,770
What are they, acrobats?

218
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,900
Martial arts from Xing, maybe?

219
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,900
This might be tough...

220
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,440
But still...

221
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,190
Yeah...

222
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,690
They're nothing...

223
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:23,950
...when compared to our Master!

224
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,030
What's that?

225
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,960
And there they go.

226
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,580
Old man, can I get some dessert?

227
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:37,960
Sure!

228
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,400
Shit!

229
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,950
Dammit...

230
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,920
All of a sudden demanding information on philosopher's stones and immortality...

231
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,210
...and then picking a fight with us...

232
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,920
What the hell are you guys up to?!

233
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,300
You, and that thin-eyed bastard!

234
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,640
I hit him?

235
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,230
Oww...

236
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:41,400
This guy went nuts right after I called Ling a thin-eyed bastard...

237
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,530
I get it...

238
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,820
Oh! Long time no see, Paninya!

239
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,450
What the heck are you doing?

240
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,290
Well, I guess I can kind of see the situation...

241
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,700
Oh, Paninya, can I ask you for a favor?

242
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:02,710
How strange... I can't seem to sense a flow of energy from that armored man...

243
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,000
What's going on...

244
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:10,220
You thought you'd stand a chance if you added allies?!

245
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,550
You fool!

246
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,180
What's wrong? What's wrong?

247
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,560
I can read your moves now!

248
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:26,900
If his subordinate is like this, then I guess that
thin-eyed bastard isn't that big of a deal himself!

249
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:36,660
Just as I thought... This guy gets
all worked up when his master is insulted.

250
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,870
And when that happens...

251
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,130
Your attacks become simple and easy to read!

252
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:50,220
Well then, I guess it's about time you revealed your face!

253
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,390
A woman?!

254
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,030
To have an internally mounted cannon...

255
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,570
I can't take this country lightly.

256
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,120
Well, I guess that wasn't bad for my first try.

257
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,750
Alchemy...

258
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,040
You did this without a transmutation circle?!

259
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,090
Well, then...

260
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,010
I wonder if Brother is doing okay?

261
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,800
I went a little overboard...

262
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,430
What should I do...

263
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,220
Master Ling is going to scold me...

264
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,440
Come on, missy.

265
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,360
What the hell are you using in a town?

266
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,990
If it hadn't been me, you would have killed someone!

267
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,280
Bastard... You broke your arm?!

268
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,490
I chased rabbits all the time when I was a kid.

269
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,710
Traps are my specialty.

270
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,420
Brother!

271
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,960
Yo, Al.

272
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,040
Good work, everyone!

273
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,500
You... coming out like that!

274
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,220
Man, you guys are really strong.

275
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,840
How about it? Become my underlings and let's rule a country?

276
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,140
Quit daydreaming!

277
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,180
How about you go back-

278
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,600
There they are!

279
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,600
You guys sure destroyed a lot of our city.

280
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,150
I hope you plan to pay for it.

281
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,150
Don't forget to pay for all that food, too.

282
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,230
H-Hang on a sec!

283
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,990
All the repair and the meal costs should be for these guys...

284
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:36,410
I no really understand this country language!

285
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,740
Bye-bye!

286
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,370
Get back here!!!

287
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,080
Huh?

288
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,040
They got away!

289
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,290
That one, too?!

290
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,460
What should we do...

291
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,800
I'd like to fix it all, but I'm kind of...

292
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,590
It's all right, Brother... I'll do it.

293
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:59,180
Huh? You can do it without a transmutation circle now?

294
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,520
Yeah. I think it's because my memories of the truth returned to me.

295
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:05,730
Which means...

296
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:05,770

Height

348
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,190
Brother's

349
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,190
Dignity

350
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,570
Just leave the rest to me.

351
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,320
Brother's

352
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,320
Dignity

353
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,910
What's wrong, Brother?

354
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,990
We're back!

355
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,040
Hey, we meet again!

356
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,250
What are you sitting there drinking tea for?!

357
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:30,090
That's horrible! I thought we were friends...

358
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,250
Who are you calling a friend?

359
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,090
Do you know what we went through because of your two subordinates?!

360
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,760
I'll scold them later, so forgive us, yeah?

361
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,600
The girl is Ran Fan,

362
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,510
and the old man is Fu.

363
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,980
They're from a clan that's served my family for generations.

364
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,730
Don't be too angry at them.

365
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,860
You leech off of me for food and you have
two companions with you? You seem like a rich guy.

366
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,530
Well, I'm a prince, after all.

367
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,990
Huh?

368
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,490
Prince?

369
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,910
You?

370
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,290
A prince?!

371
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,500
Isn't this the part where you're supposed to be astonished?

372
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:13,250
Sorry, it was just too unexpected...

373
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:17,420
A guy who passes out from hunger and then leeches off of people for food... a prince?!

374
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,350
I won't allow you to speak ill of Master Ling...

375
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,600
You were here all along?

376
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:28,850
Well, I guess "prince" doesn't really mean much.

377
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,610
Since there are so many of us princes.

378
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:37,110
Xing is a nation made up of more than fifty different clans,

379
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,200
and the emperor reigns at the top of that.

380
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,290
And a daughter of the chief of each clan marries the emperor and bears a child.

381
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:50,960
The current emperor has
twenty-four sons and nineteen daughters.

382
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,710
And I'm twelfth in line for succession.

383
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,510
Forty-three kids?

384
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:59,090
Aren't there ever disputes over who becomes heir?

385
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:02,090
We're right in the middle of that.

386
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,930
The Emperor is in very poor health right now...

387
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:09,480
Each clan is getting worked up to curry favor with him, since this is the best time to do so...

388
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,230
Which is why I'm also...

389
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,020
Going to offer up immortality to gain his favor...

390
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,110
Correct!

391
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,690
So please, won't you tell me?

392
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,240
Information about the Philosopher's Stone.

393
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,860
Nope!

394
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,410
Philosopher's stones aren't tools to be used for promotion!

395
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,540
If you won't tell me, I'll follow you forever!

396
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,910
Don't!!!

397
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,120
I'm back!

398
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,960
There seemed to be a huge commotion on the main street, so I got kinda held up-

399
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,380
Why is it torn off?!

400
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:43,720
Seriously!

401
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,800
Every! Single! Time!!!

402
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,220
Young master!

403
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:53,480
You don't need to bow down to those lowlifes...

404
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,520
If one bow from me would do the job,
that'd be really cheap.

405
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,110
The fate of 500,000 people in the Yao clan is in my hands.

406
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,070
My image is the least of my concerns.

407
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,120
So, where are you planning on going next to break your automail?

408
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,200
Why do you assume I'm going to break it?

409
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,080
We're thinking of going to Central to look something up.

410
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,250
Huh? You're going to Central?!

411
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,340
I want to go, too!

412
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,750
What for?

413
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,630
To give my regards to Mr. Hughes!

414
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,510
But don't you have work to do, Winry?

415
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,310
Not a problem at all, Winry.

416
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,140
You need to take a breather every now and then.

417
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,020
Really?! Thank you so much, Mr. Garfield!

418
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,940
Well then, I guess...

419
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,520
We're all headed for Central!

420
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,270
Yep!

421
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:41,570
It'll be quite a trip! I'm so excited!

422
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:45,070
You're not coming!!!

423
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,750
She came along anyway, didn't she?

424
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,880
Oh yeah, I still don't know your name, Master.

425
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,170
Won't you tell me already?

426
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:08,050
Ishbalans consider their names gifts from God and speak of them with honor.

427
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:11,310
My my... You must have a grand name...

428
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,560
Therefore, I got rid of my name.

429
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,310
Go! Keep moving!

430
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,310
Y-Yes sir!

431
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,820
If I'm on a path of no return...

432
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,240
...I'll get rid of everything I've ever received from God.

433
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:38,340
I don't have to act tough, right?

434
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:38,340
Tsuyogaranakute iindane

435
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:45,140
The scribbling someone made...

436
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:45,140
Dareka ga kaitetta

437
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:50,940
On the wall, of a flower is swaying.

438
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:50,940
Kabe no rakugaki no hana ga yureru

439
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:56,520
No one knows their true selves.

440
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:56,520
Jibunrashisa nante dermo wakaranaiyo

441
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,820
Even though we both lose and gain

442
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,820
Nagai nagai michi no tochuu de

443
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:02,240
By embarking on this long, long path,

444
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:02,240
Nakushitari hirottari

445
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:09,910
And though there may be days loneliness strikes and makes us weep...

446
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:09,910
Kyuu ni samishikunatte naichau hi mo arukedo

447
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,420
Let's transform our tears and pains to stars.

448
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,420
Namida mo itami mo hoshi ni kaeyou

449
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:23,420
Let's light a candle to illuminate our tomorrow.

450
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:23,420
Ashita wo terasu akari wo tomosou

451
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:28,550
And we'll hold our small hands over the fire to create stardust,

452
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:28,550
Chiisana te kazashite futari de tsukurou

453
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:33,770
And an eternity that shines so brilliantly.

454
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:33,770
Hoshikuzu wo tsuyoku hikaru eien wo

455
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:39,150
Farewells may be unavoidable,

456
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:39,150
Sayonara itsuka wa kurukamoshirenai

457
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:45,070
Kisetsu wa soredemo meguri megutteku

458
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:45,070
Yet the seasons continue to change obliviously.

459
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,160
Even if I lose myself, I'll continue to walk...

460
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,160
Chiisaku mayottemo aruiteku

461
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,200
Walk by your side.

462
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,200
Kimi to aruiteku

463
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,500
That's the only thing I'd like to never change.

464
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,500
Sore dake wa kawaranaideiyoune

465
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:08,110
A sad truth greets Ed, Al, and Winry, who returned to Central with the hopes of a warm reunion.

466
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,660
And the darkness chooses another, new sacrifice.

467
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:17,910
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

468
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:21,410
Footsteps of a
Comrade-in-Arms

469
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:21,410
Episode 16, Footsteps of a Comrade-in-Arms.

470
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,630
Is it light or darkness...

471
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,340
...within the heart of the man who began to move forward?
