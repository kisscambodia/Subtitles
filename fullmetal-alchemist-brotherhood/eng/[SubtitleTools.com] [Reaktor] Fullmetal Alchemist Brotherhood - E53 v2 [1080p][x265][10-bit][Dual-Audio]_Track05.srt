1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,150
The new morning we've finally found

2
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,150
Yatto mitsuketa atarashii asa wa

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,190
is being hampered by the past.

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,190
Tsukihi ga jama wo suru

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,660
What we chased after wasn't the future,

6
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,660
Mukau saki wa tsugi ja nakute

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,490
but the past so full of remorse.

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,490
Sugi bakari oikaketa

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,960
The ruthless memories won't stop playing;

10
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,960
Nariyamanai yousha nai omoide tachi wa

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,050
they won't be forgiving us for a long time.

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,050
Yurushite kuresou nimonai

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,890
It's about now that a teardrop

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,890
Sorosoro kana tesaguri tsukareta hoho wo

15
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,560
beings to roll down my fatigued cheeks.

16
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,560
Kattou ga koboreochiru

17
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,810
Will this rain ever stop?

18
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,810
Ame wa itsuka yamunodeshouka

19
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:52,030
I've been freezing for a long time.

20
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:52,030
Zuibun nagai aida tsumetai

21
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,320
Why does the rain continue to fix on me?

22
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,320
Ame wa doushite boku wo erabuno

23
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,080
I wonder if it could embrace me.

24
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,080
Tsutsumarete iikana

25
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,870
Today, the rain falls again;

26
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,870
Ame wa yamu koto wo shirazuni

27
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,090
endlessly it falls knowing no end.

28
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,090
Kyou mo furitsuzukukeredo

29
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,130
We nestle close to each other to share the warmth

30
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,130
Sotto sashidashita kasa no naka de

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:28,850
under this umbrella, you gently held out to me.

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:28,850
Nukumori ni yorisoinagara

33
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,020
What the hell is going on?

34
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,480
What happened?!

35
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,360
I don't know.

36
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,700
I heard Colonel Mustang did something.

37
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,780
Are you serious?

38
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,990
Well, it's just a rumor I heard.

39
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,030
Hey! Turn on the radio!

40
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,240
"Radio Capital"!

41
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,080
Radio Capital?

42
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,870
Yeah! There's something crazy going on!

43
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,710
That station is so lame.

44
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,790
Just do it!

45
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,920
Before the military stops the broadcast!

46
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,840
Hurry!

47
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,350
Is that right, Madam?

48
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,100
The Führer President's wife?

49
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:04,930
Yes.

50
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,350
The Central Army tried to murder me.

51
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,130
Flame of Vengeance

52
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,740
So they pointed a gun at you to shoot you dead?

53
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,110
That's right.

54
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,990
He said, "Kill her along with Colonel Mustang's men."

55
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,000
I've heard that Führer President Bradley is currently in the east for an inspection,

56
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,750
and is not in Central at the moment.

57
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,250
Yes.

58
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,420
So do you suppose someone in the upper echelon

59
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,670
is planning a coup d'etat while the Führer President is absent?

60
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,010
I can't say for sure.

61
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,350
Is this truly the real Madam?

62
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,060
I recognize this voice, though. She's real.

63
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:50,690
But Madam, the fact that your son was also not in Central at the time is...

64
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,900
I can't get in touch with my son either!

65
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,520
What?!

66
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,610
You've gotta be kidding me!

67
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,150
Poor thing...

68
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,610
I hope Selim's safe and sound.

69
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,660
Please get yourself together, Madam Bradley.

70
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,700
A coup d'etat, they say!

71
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,490
In any case, we are thankful that you're safe and sound.

72
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,160
Do you think anyone other than Bradley would be able to keep this nation together?

73
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:14,000
If Colonel Mustang hadn't saved me,
I don't even know if I'd be here right now...

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,050
I see, so Colonel Mustang had already predicted the coup d'etat.

75
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,380
Mustang, huh...?

76
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,300
Well then, could you please describe in detail of what happened when you were rescued?

77
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,680
Of course.

78
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:32,020
Have you still not told her that Selim is a homunculus?

79
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,850
A gun was pointed at me, so I closed my eyes and began saying my prayers to God.

80
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,270
How could we?

81
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,190
She doesn't even know that her husband is currently missing.

82
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,400
When I heard a gun go off, I thought everything was over.

83
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,690
But-

84
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,320
We hadn't told you this yet, Madam,

85
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:50,660
but the thing is, the train that the Führer President was on yesterday in the east was bombed by someone.

86
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,580
What?

87
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,290
He is currently missing.

88
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,210
Madam Bradley!

89
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,970
Are you all right?!

90
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:09,720
I-It appears as though Madam Bradley is feeling ill due to shock.

91
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,020
But the Führer President has gone missing?
What could this mean?

92
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:22,360
Colonel Mustang has always been leery of the upper echelon,

93
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,870
and was anticipating that they'd pull something.

94
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,490
And that's when the Führer President's train was bombed,

95
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,290
and on top of that, an order to shoot the Madam was given.

96
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,580
Everything is clear now.

97
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:39,590
There is a faction in the upper echelon that wants to get rid of the Führer President.

98
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,090
Fool!

99
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,970
Hurry up and stop the broadcast!

100
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,840
Be well-prepared for the consequences if you refuse!

101
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,100
But we can't!

102
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:56,850
They've taken hostages, and we can hardly move due to the fact that they've got a gun on us!

103
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:01,820
And for starters, there are so many of them that we don't know what to do!

104
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,490
Let me talk to Mustang!

105
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,360
I'll talk to him directly!

106
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,240
Huh?

107
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,240
The... Colonel?

108
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,080
Don't shoot!

109
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,340
Forgive me! Please!

110
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,100
How did you like my acting?

111
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,230
It was perfect!

112
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,270
Okay, keep the show airing!

113
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:39,770
Sir!

114
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,230
Like we can let a scoop like this go!

115
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,570
Next, we will have one of Colonel Mustang's subordinates speak with us.

116
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,160
She also participated in the mission to rescue the Madam.

117
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,120
So it wasn't the Colonel who planned the coup d'etat.

118
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,410
We, who support Colonel Mustang, have very little influence...

119
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,080
This... voice!

120
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,370
...but inheriting the Führer President's will,

121
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:02,880
we are prepared to stand up to our underhanded opponents with everything we've got,

122
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,920
in the name of justice.

123
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,300
That damned Mustang.

124
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,770
Now that Bradley isn't around, he's exploiting the hell out of the Führer President's influence.

125
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,810
And bringing up words like 'justice'...

126
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,530
It would be nice if the people would take his bait.

127
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,530
You sounded like you're used to this kind of stuff.

128
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,580
I'm surprised you could use a silly and vague word like 'justice'.

129
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,910
It's fine.

130
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,540
Everyone loves justice.

131
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,960
She's right.

132
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,790
The first person to say it wins.

133
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,170
What the hell is going on?

134
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:46,300
I heard it's not Mustang and his men's doing.

135
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,090
Is that really true?

136
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,140
Roy Mustang is telling the truth.

137
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,470
We just arrived here from the east,

138
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:59,100
but there was a huge ruckus over there
about the Führer President's train being blown up.

139
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,360
Do the people at Central still not know about it?

140
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,610
The highest-ranking man in the nation is missing, and they still haven't bothered to tell its people anything?

141
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,110
So it really is a coup d'etat?!

142
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,490
Who's the mastermind?

143
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,620
If Radio Capital happens to be ambushed and the Madam gets killed,

144
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,370
it's obviously the upper echelon who's behind it all!

145
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,290
What happened to Selim?!

146
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,170
He's probably being taken hostage!

147
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,880
I hope he's still alive...

148
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,260
What the hell are the guards doing?!

149
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,340
Sir!

150
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,760
Apparently, the enemy was in possession of more firearms than they'd expected,

151
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,890
and they're putting up a bitter fight.

152
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,890
There has to be limit to how many firearms they can carry!

153
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,400
We have a call from the guards.

154
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:46,570
Here, sir.

155
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,650
What took you so long to contact us?!

156
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,190
What is going on over there?!

157
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:50,820
Over!

158
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,110
W-We had no idea the men from Briggs were in possession of such-

159
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,080
H-Hey!

160
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,500
W-Will we be okay?

161
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,080
There's no way they'll take control of this place, right?

162
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,090
Of course!

163
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,590
Seriously... what fools.

164
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,050
They're going to have to bring in something like a tank to-

165
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:13,970
Huh?

166
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,470
What?!

167
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,310
Shall I lend you a hand, Fullmetal?

168
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,690
Colonel!

169
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,030
Looks like you've made some new friends.

170
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,570
Scar.

171
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,620
But wow, this place brings back memories, Lieutenant.

172
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,700
It reminds me of your crying face.

173
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,290
I'd like to see honest tears like that from you again someday.

174
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,790
I thought you despised liquids.

175
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,300
Since they make you useless.

176
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,680
Save the chatting for later!

177
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,510
Take them down!

178
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,680
Don't you order me around!

179
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,680
Roger!

180
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,470
We need to defeat these pale things, right?

181
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,640
It's useless, Lieutenant!

182
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,730
Bullets aren't enough to bring them down!

183
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,560
That again?!

184
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,900
Why does this always happen?

185
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,320
Homunculi?

186
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,530
No, their wounds aren't recovering.

187
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,740
But they don't die.

188
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,080
Must be the power of a philosopher's stone.

189
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,490
They are enemies, Fullmetal.

190
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,380
Running around like a cockroach...!

191
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,050
Seems like he doesn't want me going this way.

192
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,050
That sensation also grows larger as I go...

193
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,050
It has to be...!

194
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,460
Is that you, May?!

195
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,960
Envy!

196
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,090
You guys...!

197
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:01,890
Fool!

198
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,640
Why didn't you return to your country?!

199
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:06,770
But...

200
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,310
B-

201
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,560
Because...!

202
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,100
It's fine. Don't cry.

203
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,730
I'm so sorry, Mister Scar!

204
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,610
Man...

205
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:19,780
Human traits like this make my skin crawl.

206
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:27,910
But wow, looks like you guys showed them who's boss.

207
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,670
The Fullmetal Alchemist and the Flame Alchemist.

208
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,250
In addition, Scar.

209
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:38,300
The shitty chimeras I owe a favor to from up north are with you too.

210
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,470
Now... I wonder who I should take care of first.

211
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,800
So you're Envy?

212
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,810
You're the Homunculus that can change form, right?

213
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,770
Oh, you know about me?

214
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,060
Nice to meet you, Colonel Mustang.

215
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,230
Wait, huh?

216
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,570
Is this okay, Scar?

217
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:01,150
He's a State Alchemist who turned Ishbal into hell.

218
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,660
You're right.

219
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,240
What, you're all buddy-buddy now?

220
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,410
This is boring.

221
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,620
Show me something more muddy and disgusting.

222
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,540
I find enjoyment in watching you pieces of trash shrieking like animals.

223
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:23,050
I don't have time to entertain your vulgar hobbies.

224
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,470
Vulgar?

225
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,800
Well then, let me ask.

226
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:33,560
Don't you humans also love watching people's unhappiness and watching fools dance?

227
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,060
Isn't that why you're always fighting wars?

228
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:42,990
True, it is indeed entertaining to watch fools dance like madmen.

229
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:51,250
It's especially entertaining to watch fools like you homunculi dance.

230
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,870
Well, I answered your question.

231
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,250
Now it's time for you to answer mine.

232
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,380
Who killed Maes Hughes?

233
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,140
Answer me, Homunculus.

234
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,770
Maria Ross.

235
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,690
The one you burned to a crisp.

236
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,400
Wrong.

237
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,900
It wasn't her.

238
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:25,400
So you basically burned an innocent woman alive?!

239
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,030
Nice one!

240
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,240
You're terrible!

241
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,910
So, how did you explain it to her family?

242
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,450
Did you cry and beg for mercy?

243
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,210
Or did you perhaps refrain from saying anything because you were afraid of how furious they'd be?

244
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,460
Were you never taught to shut your mouth, moron?!

245
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,220
I'm starting to get tired of asking you homunculi the same question.

246
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,340
Simply state the truth,

247
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,220
you moron!

248
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,890
Who killed Hughes?

249
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,120
Congratulations, Colonel Mustang!

250
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,330
You finally found the real culprit.

251
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:27,010
I can't imagine Hughes getting killed by a moron like you.

252
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,840
'Moron'?

253
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,680
Morons are what you'd call...

254
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,770
...idiots like Hughes...

255
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:42,020
...who'd fall for dumb shit like this!

256
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,070
Your face changed!

257
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,280
I love that expression!

258
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:53,870
Hughes had a great look on his face when I killed him too!

259
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,660
Yeah, that face!

260
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:01,120
The despair of being killed by someone who looks just like his beloved wife...

261
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,000
It was just...

262
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,880
...the best!

263
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,920
It's decided.

264
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,680
You're the one who killed Hughes.

265
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,100
That's all I needed to know.

266
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,480
You don't need to say anything else, Envy.

267
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,900
Let's start this by...

268
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,320
...reducing your tongue to ashes.

269
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,290
Scar.

270
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,210
Fullmetal.

271
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,290
Leave this place to me.

272
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,340
He's my prey.

273
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,760
G-Gotcha.

274
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,390
Well then, we'll leave this place to you and go on-

275
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,430
Who gave you permission to pass?

276
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,770
I still need to repay the debt you guys gave me up north-

277
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:11,450
Do you have the time to be speaking to others while facing me?

278
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:17,700
Seems like there's quite a lot of fat on that blabbering tongue of yours.

279
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,950
It burns quite well, Envy.

280
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,420
Lieutenant, will it really be okay-

281
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,960
Go, Edward.

282
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,460
We'll figure something out.

283
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,750
But...

284
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,920
Go, Edward Elric.

285
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,140
Don't you have something you need to take care of?

286
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,050
Come on, let's go, Ed.

287
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:38,760
Hey-

288
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,770
You son of a....!

289
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,270
The Colonel will be fine.

290
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:54,150
Finishing off a homunculus
should be a piece of cake for him.

291
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,160
That's not the issue I'm worried about.

292
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,030
Huh?

293
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,240
Then what is?

294
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,830
I see, so you've been seeking revenge for Hughes' death the entire time.

295
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:10,750
What a beautiful friendship!

296
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,720
Stay back, Lieutenant.

297
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:34,530
Out of respect for that beautiful friendship, I'll fight you seriously.

298
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,450
But I can't really hold back when fighting in this state.

299
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,030
Don't blame me for any-

300
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,000
How does it feel to have all the liquids within your eyes boil?

301
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,170
The pain goes far beyond anything you could possibly imagine, doesn't it.

302
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,170
You little-

303
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,800
It was nice of you to make yourself a bigger target.

304
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,720
Did you think you could beat me if you increased your size?

305
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,810
Moron.

306
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,600
Get up, monster.

307
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,600
Hurry up and regenerate.

308
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,310
I'll have you repeat this suffering until you're dead.

309
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,020
That's...

310
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,320
That's right.

311
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:15,320
He's the one who burned Lust to death!

312
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,620
Wait!

313
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,740
Colonel!

314
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,660
You wait here, Lieutenant!

315
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,040
I'll dispose of him on my own!

316
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,260
Yeah, I think it's this way.

317
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,550
These things look creepy.

318
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,350
They're almost like veins.

319
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:46,220
I keep having this nasty feeling, like I'm having heartburn.

320
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,560
Not surprising.

321
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,690
There's a huge cluster of energy ahead.

322
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,070
Cluster of energy?

323
00:18:55,530 --> 00:19:00,490
Would you get it if I described it as an insane number of people crawling about?

324
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:04,870
Not really, but I do understand that it feels disgusting.

325
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:11,040
I'd hate to encounter an enemy in a place like this.

326
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,170
Scar, do you mind?

327
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,670
Is this about the Flame Alchemist?

328
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:29,680
Because I once lost my soul after engulfing myself in flames of revenge, I can understand well.

329
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,440
If he goes on...

330
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,690
...he'll end up reducing even his own heart with the flames of wrath.

331
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,000
Where did you go, Envy?!

332
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,050
Damn him...!

333
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:01,680
If you don't come out, you'll be seeing another huge explosion from me!

334
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,930
Yo, Roy.

335
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,600
You're human after all! Let this throw you into confusion!

336
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:19,360
You'd set your best friend aflame without hesitation?!

337
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,150
Hughes is dead.

338
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,610
He's no longer here.

339
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,200
Your actions do nothing more than feeding oil to flames!

340
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,330
Damn you!!

341
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,580
Don't get so cocky!!

342
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,050
Again...!

343
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:42,550
My eyes... My eyes...!

344
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,510
Fool.

345
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:46,970
You came at me, thinking I wouldn't use much firepower if you were near me?

346
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,930
Unfortunately for you, I can pinpoint.

347
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:53,140
Don't you dare underestimate me!

348
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,360
Colonel, I'm going to have to disobey your orders.

349
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,710
He ran away again.

350
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,410
You're disobeying my orders, Lieutenant.

351
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:56,620
I apologize.

352
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,960
But I couldn't just stand there and wait...

353
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,840
Where is Envy?

354
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,760
I lost him.

355
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,090
This place is like a maze.

356
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,220
Don't leave my side, Lieutenant.

357
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,600
Now that you're here, I'm going to ask for your help.

358
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,800
Ever since that day passed,

359
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,800
Ano hi kara zutto

360
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,050
I promised myself that I'd never cry.

361
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,050
Nakanaito kimetekitakedo

362
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:51,600
But even while I hoarded up the pain,

363
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:51,600
Itami wo kasanetemo

364
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,710
there was something I couldn't forgive myself for.

365
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,710
Nanika wo yurusezu ni ita

366
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,150
I'll never be able

367
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,150
Mou modorenai

368
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,650
to return to those days.

369
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,650
Ikutsumo no hibi

370
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:07,740
I'm still powerless.

371
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:07,740
Boku wa mada nanimo dekizuni

372
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:12,990
I watch as the shards of memories disappear, one by one;

373
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:12,990
Kimi no ita kioku no kakera

374
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:18,860
Mata hitotsu kieteyuku

375
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:18,860
memories of when you were still with me.

376
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,880
I long to become

377
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,880
Kyou yori motto

378
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,630
stronger than I am now,

379
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,630
Tsuyoku naritai

380
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:29,770
so that my voice will eventually reach you.

381
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:29,770
Kono koe ga itsuka todokuyouni

382
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,140
If the wind happens to stop

383
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,140
Arukitsuzukete

384
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,850
in the midst of my long journey,

385
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,850
Kaze ga yandara

386
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:39,560
Kimi wo sagashite sora miageruyo

387
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:39,560
I'll look up at the sky in search of you.

388
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:46,900
Beyond the daybreak, a ray of light breaks free.

389
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:46,900
Yoake no saki ni hikari ga sasuyo

390
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:52,450
A rainbow spans across the sky.

391
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:52,450
Niji ga kakaruyo

392
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,410
From the moment someone is born,

393
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:04,290
they gradually become more and more human as time goes by.

394
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,880
And what has been accumulated eventually becomes complete as a strong self.

395
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,340
However...

396
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:17,810
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

397
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:22,060
Episode 54, Beyond the Inferno.

398
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:22,080
Beyond the Inferno

399
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,610
Peer once more at your heart.
