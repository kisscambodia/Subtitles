1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:06,180
Alchemy is a science where one understands the structure of matter, breaks it down, then rebuilds it.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,810
However, it is not an all-powerful technique,
as one cannot create something out of nothing.

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:17,610
If one wishes to gain something,
one must present something of equal value.

4
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:22,320
This is the concept of equivalent exchange, the fundamental basis of alchemy.

5
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,950
However, there is a taboo in alchemy. Human transmutation.

6
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,290
One must not commit this act.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,970
I've still got a lot of years ahead of me

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,970
Kono omoi wo keshiteshimau niwa

9
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,880
To just erase these feelings?

10
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,970
Mada jinsei nagai desho?

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:35,930
To just erase these feelings?

12
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:35,970
To just erase these feelings?

13
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,970
Yarinokoshiteru koto

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,970
I want to go back and finish

15
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,600
The things that I've yet to finish.

16
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,600
Yarinaoshite mitai kara

17
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:58,870
I was supposed to be chasing after my ongoing dream,

18
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:58,870
Yume no tsuzuki oikaketeita hazu nanoni

19
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:05,210
Yet I faltered over others while walking this thin, winding path.

20
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:05,210
Magarikunetta hosoi michi hito ni tsumazuku

21
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,380
It's not that I want to return to those days.

22
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,380
Ano koro mitainitte modoritai wake ja nai no

23
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,880
I'm searching for the sky I lost.

24
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,880
Nakushitekita sora wo sagashiteru

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,550
Don't make that sad face, as if you've fallen victim.

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,550
Wakatte kuremasu youni

27
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:18,760
As if you want people to pity you.

28
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:18,760
Gisei ni natta youna kanashii kao wa yameteyo

29
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,470
Tears aren't the end of your sins.

30
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,470
Tsumi no saigo wa namida ja nai yo

31
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,140
You have to bear them painfully, forever.

32
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,140
Zutto kurushiku seottekunda

33
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,810
Who are you waiting for in the maze of emotions,

34
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,810
Deguchi mienai kanjoumeiro ni

35
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,480
Where you can't even see the exit?

36
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,480
Dare wo matteruno?

37
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,270
I want to blurt it out more justly,

38
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,270
Shiroi nooto ni tsuzutta youni

39
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,020
Motto sunao ni hakidashitai yo

40
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,020
Just like how I wrote it in my white notebook.

41
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,690
What do you want to run from?

42
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,690
Nani kara nogaretainda

43
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,320
That thing called "reality"?

44
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,320
Genjitsu tte yatsu?

45
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,650
I just want to scream out,

46
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,650
Kanaeru tame ni ikiterundatte

47
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,070
"I'm only living to fulfill my wish." Can you hear me?

48
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,070
Sakebitaku naru yo kikoeteimasuka?

49
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:43,200
I can't take the safe way out of everything.

50
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:43,200
Bunan ni nante yatterarenaikara

51
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't even have a place to return to.

52
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,000
Kaeru basho mo nai no

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,290
I'm always thankful for everyone's kindness,

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,290
Yasashisa ni wa itsumo kansha shiteru

55
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,670
That's why I want to become stronger. (I'm on the way)

56
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,670
Dakara tsuyoku naritai (I'm on the way)

57
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,630
This is reminding me of the old days.

58
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,630
Natsukashiku naru

59
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,880
This pain is all right with me.

60
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,880
Konna itami mo kangei jan

61
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,340
To obtain more information about
the transmutation of living organisms,

62
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:08,260
Ed and Al visited Shou Tucker, the Sewing-Life Alchemist.

63
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:12,850
At his house, they met his daughter, Nina, and their dog, Alexander.

64
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:21,570
In order to pass the assessment for State Alchemists,
Tucker transmuted a chimera using Nina and Alexander.

65
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,740
Nina will never be able to return to her old self.

66
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,450
Ed was grief-stricken by his powerlessness.

67
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,110
Rain of Sorrows

68
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,040
Mom! Mom!

69
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,580
What's the matter, Ed?

70
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,800
A present for you.

71
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,880
I transmuted it myself!

72
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,050
Is that so?

73
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,300
You're Daddy's son, all right.

74
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,050
Thank you.

75
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,930
You're really amazing, Ed.

76
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,390
To be able to make something wonderful like this.

77
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,890
But...

78
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,270
You... couldn't make me correctly, could you...

79
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,030
Onii-chan.

80
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,450
Let's play.

81
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,160
Are you all right, Brother?

82
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,210
Seemed like you were having a nightmare.

83
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,230
What's the matter, you two? Isn't it
a bit early in the morning to be here?

84
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,730
Umm...

85
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,270
So what's going to happen to Tucker and Nina?

86
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:50,150
Mr. Tucker was supposed to be put on trial
and have his State Alchemist qualifications stripped...

87
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,990
...but both of them died.

88
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:53,660
"Died"?

89
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,450
I'll go ahead and let you know now, since you'll find out sooner or later.

90
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,790
They were killed.

91
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,540
Why?!

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,830
By who?!

93
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,920
We don't know.

94
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,040
I'm about to head to the scene myself.

95
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,800
We're coming with you.

96
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,300
I can't allow you to.

97
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,510
Why not?!

98
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,220
You're better off not seeing it.

99
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,020
Looks like we were a bit late.

100
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,980
We'll have to go after him soon. Or else...

101
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,770
You sound as if you knew this was going to happen.

102
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,770
What's this about?

103
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,030
God has given us a trial!

104
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:42,580
Evil heathens are trying to disturb our faith by spreading absurd rumors, and the military is planning to oppress us!

105
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,830
But we shall not give in!

106
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,210
Take up arms and rise!

107
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,840
In the name of our almighty Sun God, Leto!

108
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,430
That's right! We've got the Sun God Leto on our side!

109
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,180
Shoot the heathens!

110
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,100
Hey! Don't let him trick you!

111
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,930
That bastard has been lying to us!

112
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,020
Shut up!

113
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,690
You guys are agents of the heathens, aren't you!

114
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,690
Humans are oh so silly.

115
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,290
Don't you agree, Gluttony?

116
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,250
Foolish! Foolish!

117
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,830
Yeah, seriously.

118
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,670
Oh my, Sir High Priest.

119
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,170
Sir!

120
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,550
Sorry for giving you so much trouble.

121
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:36,550
I'll be returning to my assigned town once all of this is over.

122
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,560
The fullmetal boy got in our way, but we were able to make good use of him in the end.

123
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,060
Looks like this'll be over quicker than we'd expected.

124
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,980
All of this happened just because you manipulated a bit of information and I stirred the believers.

125
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,070
Humans are such simple beings.

126
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,780
Blood calls for blood, while hatred begets hatred,

127
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:04,540
and the energy that comes forth begins to take root in this earth and engraves a crest of blood.

128
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,920
They never learn, no matter how many times history is repeated.

129
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,300
Humans are foolish, sorrowful creatures.

130
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,470
But that's why we can have them play right into our hands, is it not?

131
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,470
Will more people die?

132
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,100
Yes, they will.

133
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,470
Can I eat all the ones that died?

134
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,850
No eating.

135
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,560
In any case Envy, just how much longer do you plan to stay in that form?

136
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,110
It's kind of gross.

137
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,440
Oh come on, I'm just going with the flow.

138
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:39,030
But I guess it's better to transform into someone young and cute, huh?

139
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,040
M-Monster!!!

140
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,540
What's this?!

141
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,330
The High Priest...

142
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:49,250
What happened to the real High Priest?!

143
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,420
What do we do?

144
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,840
He called me a monster. How rude.

145
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,380
Can I eat him?

146
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:03,720
Oh yeah, I heard Shou Tucker from East City was killed.

147
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,310
Tucker?

148
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,890
Ah well, who cares about small fry like him?

149
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,810
Well, the guy who killed him is none other than that guy.

150
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,530
If we're talking about East City, isn't the Flame Colonel stationed there?

151
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:19,030
Yup. The fullmetal brat is there, too, it seems.

152
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,320
Fullmetal...

153
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,990
It makes me mad that he interfered with our work, but we can't let him die.

154
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,500
He's an important human sacrifice, after all.

155
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,750
Thanks for the meal!

156
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,750
Got it. We'll take care of it somehow.

157
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:37,630
So, what's that guy's name again?

158
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,630
Scar?

159
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,340
Scarred man...

160
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,180
Yeah. We don't know anything about him,
so that's what we call him.

161
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,850
We have no idea what his aim is, and he's extremely elusive.

162
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,730
All we know about him is that
he has a large scar on his forehead.

163
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,360
I've heard rumors about him, but...

164
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,230
So that's who you guys have been after.

165
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,320
It was on the recommendations from military police headquarters.

166
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,950
I've got so much work from the chamber of military, too.

167
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,280
Seriously, all this is giving me a headache...

168
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:10,750
We've got five casualties so far in Central, ten nationwide. All State Alchemists.

169
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,960
Old man Gran was killed five days ago, too.

170
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,420
Brigadier General Gran?!

171
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,510
He was the lead of weapons transmutation and troop combat divisions!

172
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,880
That's how much trouble this guy really is.

173
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:26,890
Listen to me. Deploy more guards and stay put for a while.

174
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,100
I'm asking this as a friend, too.

175
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:33,230
The only famous alchemists around here were you and Tucker, right?

176
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,900
Shit!

177
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:42,150
I've always been thinking.
What is this alchemy we believe in?

178
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:50,700
"Alchemy is understanding the various rules and flow that exist within matter, breaking it down, then rebuilding it."

179
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:55,420
"This world also flows while abiding by those rules and is in a cycle."

180
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,630
"Death is also a part of that flow. Accept the flow entirely."

181
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,220
That's what our master always said, isn't it?

182
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,680
I thought I understood.

183
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,350
But I didn't.

184
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,350
That's why we transmuted Mom...

185
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:17,110
And even now, I'm thinking whether I could somehow fix something that's impossible.

186
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,360
I'm an idiot.

187
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,320
I haven't grown one bit since that time.

188
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,080
I thought that rain would wash away these pent-up feelings...

189
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,750
But every drop that hits my face makes me more miserable.

190
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,500
I can't even feel the rain hitting my skin because I have no body.

191
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,720
That by itself is lonely and cruel.

192
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:50,060
I still want to return to my old body. I want to become human again.

193
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,350
Even if it's impossible and is against the ways of this world.

194
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,980
You're Edward Elric, the "Fullmetal Alchemist", aren't you?

195
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,990
Brother!

196
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,370
What the hell is this about?!

197
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,300
Who the hell is this guy?

198
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,180
This is bad... This is bad!

199
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,470
I've got to get away!

200
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,300
This is bad... This is bad!

201
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,890
Al, run!

202
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,820
I won't let you get away!

203
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,410
Brother!

204
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,670
Al, hang on!

205
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,800
Dammit, what the hell?!

206
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,810
I haven't done anything to set anyone against me-

207
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,310
Scratch that, I've done a lot.

208
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,400
I haven't given anyone reason to go after my life, though!

209
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,570
Oww...

210
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,330
Who the hell are you? Why are you after us?!

211
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,200
Think of it this way:

212
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,580
If there is someone who created you,
then there is someone who will destroy you, as well.

213
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,080
Looks like there's no getting out of this.

214
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,090
You've got some guts.

215
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,510
But...

216
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:57,770
Too slow.

217
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:03,520
Al!

218
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,030
It's empty?

219
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,620
You bastard!!!

220
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,160
Too slow!

221
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,630
Dammit!

222
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,250
Automail...

223
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,300
Makes sense. I wouldn't be able to
destroy it with human destruction.

224
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,130
You guys are something else.

225
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,930
No, Brother!

226
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,060
You should run!

227
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,270
Idiot! How can I leave you behind and run?!

228
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:44,940
So you transmute by placing your hands together and forming a circle.

229
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,310
In that case...

230
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,070
I'll be destroying this annoying arm of yours, first.

231
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:54,740
Brother!!!

232
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:06,080
Now you can't use alchemy anymore.

233
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,420
I'll give you a bit of time to pray to God.

234
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,640
Brother, run! Brother!

235
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,560
Unfortunately, there isn't a god I want to pray to.

236
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,310
Am I the only one you're after?

237
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,560
Are you going to kill my brother... Al... too?

238
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,530
I will, if he decides to interfere.

239
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:35,820
But the only one to receive judgment
at my hands is the Fullmetal Alchemist... You...

240
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,280
All right...

241
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,490
Then promise me.

242
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,000
That you won't lay a finger on my little brother!

243
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,290
Brother...

244
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,920
I'll keep my word.

245
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,420
What are you saying... Brother?

246
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,460
What are you doing? Get out of there?!

247
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,670
Get up and run!

248
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,050
Stop it... Stop it.

249
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:00,310
Stop it! You bastard!!!

250
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,890
That's far enough.

251
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,440
You've made quite a mess of things, Scar.

252
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:13,740
I'll be taking you into custody under the offense of murdering a series of State Alchemists.

253
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:18,780
Alchemists are beings who alter the original form of matter.

254
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,240
In other words, an affront to God, the creator of all.

255
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,660
I bring judgment, acting as God's hand.

256
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,880
If you choose to get in my way, I will eliminate you, as well.

257
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,880
Interesting.

258
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,050
I don't want any of you interfering in this.

259
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,260
Colonel Mustang!

260
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,510
Mustang... The Flame Alchemist.

261
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,220
You came to me to receive judgment,
saving me the effort of having to search for you.

262
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,230
What a splendid day!

263
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,980
You know my name, yet you're picking a fight with me?

264
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,190
What a fool.

265
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,780
What was that for?!

266
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,530
Colonel, please stay back.

267
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,990
You're impotent on rainy days, after all.

268
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:07,750
Oh right, I guess you can't make sparks when it's wet like this.

269
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,500
It's awfully convenient for me if you can't make flames, State Alchemist.

270
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,630
I will destroy all here who interfere with my duty!

271
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,840
We'll just see about that!

272
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,640
Reinforcements?!

273
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:25,270
You're quite good to be able to dodge my fist.

274
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,390
You said you'd destroy everyone here, no?

275
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,150
Then try defeating me, first!

276
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,900
The Strong Arm Alchemist, Alex Louis Armstrong!!!

277
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,990
One after another...

278
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,410
This must be divine guidance, as well.

279
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,780
So you won't retreat, huh?

280
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,160
To show deference to that courage, I'll show you...

281
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,670
...a skill that has been passed down the Armstrong household for generations... Artistic Alchemy!

282
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,510
Who is he?

283
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,430
He's the one who murdered Mr. Tucker.

284
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,020
It was him ?!

285
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,640
Major! Please try not to destroy too much of the city!

286
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,770
What are you saying?!

287
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,400
Destruction and creation are like two sides of the same coin!

288
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,530
You destroy and create! This, in other words,
is the law of the universe!

289
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,110
But why naked...

290
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,030
That logic is crazy...

291
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,830
But other Alchemists won't find it crazy, though.

292
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,040
Right, Scar?

293
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,790
So he's an Alchemist, too...

294
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:39,300
I see. The three transmutation processes in Alchemy are understanding, decomposition, and reconstruction.

295
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,970
But he stops at the point of decomposition.

296
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,300
He's an alchemist, too?

297
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,640
Then he is going against "God's path", isn't he?!

298
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,850
But... why is he only after those who possess a state qualification?

299
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,780
Agility that wouldn't be expected from
his build and inhuman destructive power.

300
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,830
And on top of that, alchemy...

301
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,990
He's certainly troublesome, but...

302
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,960
Now you're stuck!

303
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,380
...this is when he takes a big swing!

304
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,750
Right here!

305
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,340
He pulled back?!

306
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:26,840
Did you get him?!

307
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,050
He's fast.

308
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,470
Just one hit, a graze.

309
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,980
Brown skin and red eyes?!

310
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,980
An Ishbalan?!

311
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,490
Looks like I'm surrounded...

312
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,450
Hey now, don't move-

313
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,080
Damn, the bastard escaped into the sewers...

314
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,790
Don't go after him.

315
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,960
Like I'd go after a dangerous guy like that.

316
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,800
Sorry about that.

317
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:04,170
You bought enough time for us to surround him, and yet...

318
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:09,470
No, I was more concerned with
staying alive rather than buying time.

319
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,970
Oh, is it over?

320
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,980
Lt. Colonel Hughes, where have you been?

321
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,560
I was taking cover.

322
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,900
Hey! Why didn't you at least give support or something?!

323
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:23,990
Shut up! Don't drag an ordinary guy like me
into you nonsensical mutants' all-around freak shows!

324
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,990
What are you gazing off into space for?! Don't you guys have work to do?!

325
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,530
Emergency deployments within the city! And be sure to whip up a description about the suspect, too!

326
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,200
Yes, sir!

327
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:30,830
Alphonse...

328
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,910
Alphonse!

329
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,330
Al! Are you all right?! Hey!

330
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,960
So that's Elric's younger brother...

331
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,590
Looks like they've got their own issues...

332
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,470
Al! Alphonse!

333
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:50,470
Why didn't you run away when
I told you to, you stupid brother!

334
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,220
Come on, I couldn't leave you behind and run away!

335
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,220
That's exactly why I'm calling you stupid!

336
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,230
What?! If I ran away, you might have been killed!

337
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,480
I might have not been killed, too!

338
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,440
Only an idiot would choose the path that leads to death!

339
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,700
Quit calling your brother an idiot!

340
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,990
I'll say it as many times as I want!

341
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,830
If you'd lived, continued to live, and survived,

342
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:17,080
and continued to study alchemy,

343
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:22,880
you could have found a way to get your limbs back
and maybe discovered how to save people like Nina!

344
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,840
I wouldn't be able to forgive you if you chose to die by throwing all of those possibilities away!

345
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,260
My arm came off! You stupid brother!

346
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,900
We're really torn up, aren't we...

347
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,520
How uncool.

348
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,490
But... we're alive.

349
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,240
Yeah. We sure are.

350
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,280
This seriously is a special all-around freak show, isn't it.

351
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,450
Sorry for keeping it from you.

352
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,450
No problem, I won't tell the higher-ups.

353
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,710
It'll be somewhat troublesome if they find out, won't it?

354
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,580
Yeah...

355
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,670
We can play off the part about Edward's limbs,
but we can't really make up an excuse for the younger one.

356
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,350
But seriously... we've got quite the ugly customer coming after us.

357
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,850
An Ishbalan, huh...

358
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:32,110
Ishbalans were a tribe of people in the East
who worshipped Ishvala as their sole creator and God.

359
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:37,120
There were a few cases of feuds after we annexed the country,

360
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,290
But thirteen years ago...

361
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:45,590
...when a military officer mistakenly shot and killed
an Ishbalan child, the situation devolved into a civil war.

362
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:55,470
A riot called forth more riots, and the civil war eventually spread throughout all of the east.

363
00:20:56,050 --> 00:21:01,060
The order given from the highest level of
our military after seven years of battle was...

364
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,190
...Ishbalan extermination.

365
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,860
Many State Alchemists were roped in to act as human weapons.

366
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,000
And the State Alchemists brought forth remarkable achievements.

367
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:27,130
That's why that man, who is a survivor of the Ishbalans, has a legitimate reason for wanting revenge.

368
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,050
Bullshit!

369
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:33,670
There's no legitimacy in revenge that drags in people who have nothing to do with it!

370
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:39,010
All he's doing is sugar-coating an ugly spirit of vengeance by calling himself God's hand and pretending to be all noble!

371
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,560
But the hard truth is he's hostile toward us.

372
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,520
And we can't die, either.

373
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,400
The next time we see him, we'll crush him...

374
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:49,730
...without any questions asked.

375
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:50,650
Yes, sir!

376
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:57,660
Ed, Al, what do you two plan on doing now?

377
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,990
We're going to move forward again.

378
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:04,160
We can't come to a stop as long as we're alive, after all!

379
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,540
Brother...

380
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:10,840
First off, I need to get my arm fixed in order to get your body back to normal.

381
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,840
Since I'm the only one who knows how to affix a soul to an armor.

382
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,720
You're right about that!

383
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,220
Guess we've got no choice.

384
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,470
What do you say we go and visit our mechanic?

385
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,970
We haven't shown our faces there in a while.

386
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:33,130
Say, the sky we saw that day, the scarlet sky.

387
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:33,130
Ano hi mita sora akaneiro no sora wo

388
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:38,350
Do you remember it from that day?

389
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:38,350
Nee kimi wa oboeteimasuka

390
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:44,270
We made a promise and a vow while the early summer wind circled us.

391
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:44,270
Yakusoku chigiri shoka no kaze ga tsutsumu

392
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:48,520
And we clung close together.

393
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:48,520
Futari yorisotta

394
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:57,570
Your forced smile

395
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:57,570
Muri na egao no ura

396
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:02,950
Holds elongated shadows.

397
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:02,950
Nobita kage wo kakumau

398
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:12,210
I pretend not to notice and continue on.

399
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:12,210
Dakara kizukanu furi saisei wo erabu

400
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:21,720
All the while waiting for you to deliver some news at the table.

401
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:21,720
Teeburu no ue no furuenai shirase machitsuzukete

402
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:30,110
Empty nights, mornings that will never arrive,

403
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:30,110
Kuuhaku no yoru mo kuru hazu no nai asa mo

404
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:34,860
I could see them from a mile away.

405
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:34,860
Zenbu wakattetanda

406
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:40,490
Ano hi mita sora akaneiro no sora wo

407
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:40,490
Say, the sky we saw that day, the scarlet sky.

408
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:45,410
I'm sure you'll remember it one day.

409
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:45,410
Nee itsuka omoidasu deshou

410
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:51,250
While holding the promise we couldn't keep,

411
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:51,250
Hatasenakatta yakusoku wo idaite

412
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:55,510
We take our first steps down our own paths.

413
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:55,510
Futari arukidasu

414
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:07,720
Winry's smile greets Ed and Al, who return
to Resembool to rest their battle-wounded bodies.

415
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:14,310
On the other hand, a philosopher's stone
appears before them, shrouded in a deep mystery.

416
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:18,770
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

417
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,790
Road of Hope

418
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,360
Episode 6, The Road of Hope.

419
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:26,910
The wind blows through the hill in the sunset.
What does it bring the boy?
