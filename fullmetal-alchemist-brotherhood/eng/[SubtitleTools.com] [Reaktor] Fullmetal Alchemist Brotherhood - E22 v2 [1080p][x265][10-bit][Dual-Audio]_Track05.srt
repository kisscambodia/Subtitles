1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:06,190
Drawn by a landscape as white as snow,

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:06,190
Masshiro na keshiki ni ima sasowarete

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,740
I'm headed toward an unseen world.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,740
Boku wa yuku yo mada minu sekai e

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,680
I've been traveling while lost

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,680
Maigo no mama tabi shiteita

7
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,470
Under this gray sky.

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,460
Nezumiiro no sora no shita

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,560
Every day with new maps, stained with my many dreams.

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,560
Higawari no chizu ikutsumo no yume ga nijindeita

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,950
I wonder if someday,

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,950
Itsuka wa sa

13
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,990
Even with these tiny steps of mine,

14
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,990
Chippoke na boku no kono hohaba demo

15
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:43,070
I'll be able to travel beyond those clouds.

16
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:43,070
Ano kumo no mukou made yukeru kana

17
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,700
I put on a bold front.

18
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,700
Tsuyogatte

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,250
End up hurting myself.

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,250
Kizutsuita

21
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,330
Kokoro sukashita youni

22
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,330
I feel empty inside.

23
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,870
It's started to rain,

24
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,870
Furidashita

25
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,040
And the raindrops

26
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,040
Amatsubu tachi ga

27
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,260
Began to repeat their scattered reflections.

28
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,260
Ranhansha kurikaesu

29
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,130
These straight rays of light

30
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,130
Massugu na hikari ga

31
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,850
Kousa shite

32
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,850
Start to cross one another.

33
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,430
And without telling anyone where they're headed,

34
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,430
Yakusaki mo tsugenumama

35
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,720
Across the endless distances,

36
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,720
Doko made mo

37
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,310
They pass through all matter.

38
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,310
Tsukinukeru

39
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:14,140
I burn these faint afterimages onto my eyes.

40
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:14,140
Awai zanzou ryoume ni yakitsukete

41
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,060
Under this sky,

42
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,060
Kono sora no shita

43
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,890
Wherever I am,

44
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,890
Donna toko ni itemo

45
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,190
I should be able to reach

46
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,190
Todoku hazu nanda

47
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:27,000
The unseen world.

48
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:27,000
Mada minu sekai e

49
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,690
Scar appears in Central once again.

50
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:45,450
In order to lure out the Homunculi, Ed and Al work with Ling in order to purposely attract Scar's attention.

51
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:53,410
The plan works, and Gluttony and Wrath make their appearances.

52
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,210
However...

53
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,750
Ran Fan!!!

54
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,180
You deflected the slash with your kunai, eh?

55
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,060
Can I eat her?

56
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,480
Make it quick.

57
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,650
Ran Fan! Pull yourself together!

58
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,450
You think you can escape my eye?

59
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,300
Seems you're quite experienced.

60
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,720
He's constantly trying to bring his attack toward my left side, my blind side.

61
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,510
Gluttony!

62
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,680
Roger!

63
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,740
Now, no one can see us here.

64
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,910
I've got a lot to ask you.

65
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,790
Just what are you folks?

66
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,290
How can you tell what's inside Gluttony?

67
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,540
You're still trying to escape in this situation?

68
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:27,300
If you throw that extra baggage away,
I bet you'll be able to save your own tail.

69
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,300
Baggage, you say?

70
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:34,140
You're the highest ranking man in this country, right?

71
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,060
If I remember correctly, your name is Führer President King Bradley.

72
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,310
The king exists for his people.

73
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,560
Without his people, there is no king.

74
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:47,820
King Bradley, you'll never be able to become a true king!

75
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,570
You're far too inexperienced.

76
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,530
There is no such thing as a true king!

77
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,670
You rely on your eye too much!

78
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,840
From the draft, the exit should be...

79
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,510
What's wrong?

80
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,010
I still have this eye, you know!

81
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,040
Backs in the Distance

82
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:22,810
Winry.

83
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,400
We'll be back soon.

84
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,190
So be good now, you hear?

85
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,170
Winry.

86
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,430
We're here.

87
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:26,920
Maybe I was thinking of Mr. Hughes as my dad...

88
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,590
Come see him every now and then, okay?

89
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,680
He always hated being alone.

90
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,390
Miss Gracia...

91
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,540
I heard the Elric Brothers are fighting!

92
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,130
What? Again?!

93
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,970
Military police are running all over the place!

94
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:16,590
What are they fighting over this  time?

95
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:17,840
Geez...

96
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,470
Apparently, they're fighting against that guy who only goes after State Alchemists.

97
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,480
They still haven't caught him yet?

98
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,440
What the heck is the army doing?

99
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,610
No... What am I thinking?

100
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,670
A dead end!

101
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,130
Dammit!

102
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,440
Nice, my little brother!

103
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,860
Shut up and run!

104
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,690
Have we been given permission to engage yet?!

105
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,360
Not yet, sir!

106
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,150
Dammit! What's going on?!

107
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,750
We haven't gotten the signal from Lin yet.

108
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,250
Brother is starting to get tired, too.

109
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,620
I should buy some time.

110
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,340
Scar! You use alchemy, too.

111
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,010
Why are you so against alchemists
with the mindset they oppose God?!

112
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,220
I told you in East City.

113
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,390
There are ones like you, who create, and ones like me, who destroy.

114
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,680
You...

115
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:53,190
You just want to justify murder by using God's name!

116
00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:00,530
Didn't you kill Shou Tucker and Nina by acting as God's hand?!

117
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:05,700
I see. So you guys saw that chimera, too.

118
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,330
Techniques that give birth to such tragedy...

119
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,210
Is that the alchemy you fools so worship?!

120
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,670
You turned your brother into that form...

121
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,720
...with your own hands.

122
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,720
Techniques that bring about the creation of matter...

123
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,560
Isn't that the vanity which gave birth to that chimera?!

124
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,640
Even so...

125
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,640
Why did you have to kill her?!

126
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,150
Why did you take her life?!

127
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,360
I'm sure you fools understood it, too.

128
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,030
That chimera would never have been able to return to her original state.

129
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:44,870
If I had let her be, she would have received
the same treatment as other experimental animals,

130
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,660
and she would never have been treated as a human again.

131
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:03,090
That's right. Back then, we knew in our hearts
there was a possibility Nina would be experimented upon.

132
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,100
We were just postponing a problem we didn't know how to solve.

133
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,600
We didn't do anything...

134
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,600
Nothing...

135
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,370
As you say, we, alchemists, have done wrong.

136
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:35,080
But still, we can't approve of what you're doing either!

137
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,420
Do you recognize...

138
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,380
...the name of an Amestrian doctor, Rockbell?

139
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:52,810
They went to Ishbal during the civil war and continued to treat Ishbalans even after orders were given to destroy the country.

140
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:55,850
Wait, Brother!

141
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,570
Do you remember the couple who saved you,
which you killed shortly after?!

142
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,530
Brother!

143
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,660
What do you mean?

144
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,330
Winry...

145
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,040
This man...

146
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:22,710
...killed Dad... and Mom?

147
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,300
No way...

148
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:30,010
They were killed... by one of their patients?

149
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,060
Why?

150
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,650
What did Dad and Mom do?

151
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,900
They didn't do anything to deserve to die... did they?

152
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,740
Give them back...

153
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,870
Give back Dad and Mom!!!

154
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,550
Wait, Winry.

155
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,720
Don't...

156
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,680
You can't do that!

157
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,220
Winry!

158
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,850
Please, stop!

159
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,980
I understand your resentment.

160
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,480
But all revenge does is give birth to more revenge.

161
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,120
You must persevere.

162
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,000
You're those doctors' daughter, huh?

163
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,010
You have every right to shoot me.

164
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,930
Brother!

165
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,690
Brother!

166
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,150
Brother! The army is already nearby!

167
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,530
Forget about your research and-

168
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,360
Hang on. I'm almost done.

169
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,860
What is that tattoo?

170
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,320
Oh, this?

171
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:17,830
The basics of alchemy are understanding, decomposing, and reconstructing.

172
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:22,080
My right arm is for decomposing,
and my left arm is for reconstructing.

173
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:27,340
I researched Eastern Alchemy and arranged it myself.

174
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,590
What I realized from that...

175
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,760
...is that this country's alchemy is a bit strange.

176
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,800
Who cares?!

177
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,390
More importantly, the army's-

178
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,020
Hey.

179
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,480
Why are you stopping me?!

180
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,270
We need to get out of here immediately!

181
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,900
Please, restrain yourself.

182
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,530
Your brother's research may save Ishbal.

183
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,240
What?

184
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,990
Did you hear about the State Alchemists?

185
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:59,450
They're using their horrifying powers as
weapons of war and are laying waste to Ishbal.

186
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,750
Even though we're citizens of Amestris, too...

187
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,750
I know that, but...

188
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,880
What does that have anything to do with my brother?

189
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:16,100
Your brother may discover a way to gain power enough to face those State Alchemists...

190
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,810
...and perhaps even enough to destroy their army!

191
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,190
With power that far surpasses theirs...

192
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,110
To retaliate against them with alchemy!

193
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,400
Make them pay for their sins with blood!

194
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,780
Look, Brother.

195
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,660
This is the alchemy that you've been devoting yourself to.

196
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,580
Even if you wish for your efforts to benefit the people and for happiness...

197
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,170
No one views it the same way!

198
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,580
So this is alchemy...

199
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:36,260
You think something like this will save Ishbal?

200
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,110
Something like this, which creates an endless cycle of destruction and slaughter?!

201
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,740
Oh no!

202
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,460
Father! Mother!

203
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,000
You were safe!

204
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,510
Yes, we're fine.

205
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:17,300
It's a good thing we were out getting ready to escape.

206
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,550
I made it in time!

207
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,550
I was compiling all my critical papers, so I was a bit late.

208
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,060
Critical papers?

209
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,430
You hold on to this.

210
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,600
What is this?

211
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,810
My research.

212
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,520
This was all I could bring.

213
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,110
Take it and run.

214
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,320
Hang on-

215
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,450
If something were to happen to me,
all my research would go to waste.

216
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,990
Why don't you hold on to it yourself and run?!

217
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:43,870
You're a powerful monk and have gone through rigorous training.

218
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:48,460
You have a better chance of surviving than I do.

219
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,630
Look.

220
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,590
My legs won't stop trembling.

221
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,760
I'm a pathetic older brother.

222
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,420
Brother...

223
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,560
A soldier?!

224
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,520
Transmutation circles?!

225
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,360
A State Alchemist!

226
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,580
Get down!

227
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,350
Hang in there...

228
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,650
Don't die!

229
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:01,400
D-Dammit... It won't stop bleeding...

230
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,570
His arm...

231
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,580
Where is his arm...

232
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,080
Dad...

233
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,540
Mom...

234
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,500
Everyone... Someone...

235
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,930
Live...

236
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,640
You can't die.

237
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,900
I'll show them the honor of an Ishbalan!

238
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,900
If you really feel that way, then run!

239
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,150
That's right! I didn't treat you to let you die!

240
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,410
You, too, Doctor! You have to flee with your wife...

241
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,620
You're a patient! Don't be worrying about us!

242
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,490
Brother...

243
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:51,120
Get down!

244
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,750
No way...

245
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,710
He... shielded me?

246
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,540
Brother...

247
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,800
If you have the strength to escape, do so!

248
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,930
He woke up!

249
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,350
Don't move! Your wounds will re-open!

250
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,850
Dear, come!

251
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:12,640
Dear!

252
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,690
You have to rest!

253
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,820
Someone! Get that cart!

254
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,480
Please, take him with you!

255
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,570
Brother, is that you?

256
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:30,330
Thank goodness... Brother was safe-

257
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:38,380
What the hell is this?!

258
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,000
Sedatives!

259
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,760
We're out! We used them up on that other boy!

260
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,220
State Alchemists...

261
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,850
Amestrians...

262
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,060
I won't forgive them...

263
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:03,860
You... You guys...

264
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,360
Dr. Rockbell!

265
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,060
Shoot me.

266
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,530
Don't shoot, Winry!

267
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,690
Put the gun down!

268
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,650
You shouldn't hold something like that!

269
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:48,450
Winry!

270
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,160
Shoot me.

271
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,870
But if you do, I'll take you for an enemy that very instant.

272
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,040
Scar!!!

273
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,540
If you lay a finger on Winry, I'll-

274
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,830
Kill me?

275
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,290
That's fine, too.

276
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:05,300
The chain of hatred will not end unless one of us dies.

277
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,550
But don't forget this!

278
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,800
The ones who first pulled the trigger in that civil war were you...

279
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,180
...the Amestrians!

280
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,940
No! Don't shoot!

281
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,610
Put the gun down and leave this place!

282
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,270
Winry!

283
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,610
If you can't shoot, then get out of here.

284
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,200
You're in the way!

285
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,160
Don't shoot!

286
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,130
Get down!

287
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,550
Brother...

288
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,280
You stupid brother! What are you doing?!

289
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,320
Are you trying to get both of you killed?!

290
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,780
Hurry and get Winry to a safe place!

291
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,210
Winry, let go of the gun.

292
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,340
I couldn't shoot...

293
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,170
Please don't shoot. I'm begging you.

294
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:35,800
But... he killed Dad and Mom!

295
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:39,180
He tried to kill you and Al, too...

296
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:42,140
But why?!

297
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:50,440
You helped a woman give birth in
Rush Valley, and saved her and her baby.

298
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:54,950
You gave me an arm and leg so I could stand again.

299
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,870
Your hands aren't meant for killing people.

300
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,170
They're for helping them live.

301
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,250
So...

302
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:37,300
I don't have to act tough, right?

303
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:37,300
Tsuyogaranakute iindane

304
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:44,100
The scribbling someone made...

305
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:44,100
Dareka ga kaitetta

306
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:49,900
On the wall, of a flower is swaying.

307
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:49,900
Kabe no rakugaki no hana ga yureru

308
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:55,480
No one knows their true selves.

309
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:55,480
Jibunrashisa nante dermo wakaranaiyo

310
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,780
Even though we both lose and gain

311
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,780
Nagai nagai michi no tochuu de

312
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:01,200
By embarking on this long, long path,

313
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:01,200
Nakushitari hirottari

314
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:08,870
And though there may be days loneliness strikes and makes us weep...

315
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:08,870
Kyuu ni samishikunatte naichau hi mo arukedo

316
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,380
Let's transform our tears and pains to stars.

317
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,380
Namida mo itami mo hoshi ni kaeyou

318
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:22,380
Let's light a candle to illuminate our tomorrow.

319
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:22,380
Ashita wo terasu akari wo tomosou

320
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:27,510
And we'll hold our small hands over the fire to create stardust,

321
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:27,510
Chiisana te kazashite futari de tsukurou

322
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:32,730
And an eternity that shines so brilliantly.

323
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:32,730
Hoshikuzu wo tsuyoku hikaru eien wo

324
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:38,110
Farewells may be unavoidable,

325
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:38,110
Sayonara itsuka wa kurukamoshirenai

326
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:44,030
Yet the seasons continue to change obliviously.

327
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:44,030
Kisetsu wa soredemo meguri megutteku

328
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,120
Even if I lose myself, I'll continue to walk...

329
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,120
Chiisaku mayottemo aruiteku

330
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,160
Walk by your side.

331
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,160
Kimi to aruiteku

332
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,460
Sore dake wa kawaranaideiyoune

333
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,460
That's the only thing I'd like to never change.

334
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:02,640
Must one throw something away to protect someone?

335
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:07,400
And those not prepared to do so will lose both and fall?

336
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:08,940
No.

337
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,740
The resolve to protect will spread to all and outshine the disaster.

338
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:18,160
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

339
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,830
Girl on the Battlefield

340
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,830
Episode 23, Girl on the Battlefield.

341
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,750
I won't show tears of sadness...

342
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,920
...because I promised not to.
