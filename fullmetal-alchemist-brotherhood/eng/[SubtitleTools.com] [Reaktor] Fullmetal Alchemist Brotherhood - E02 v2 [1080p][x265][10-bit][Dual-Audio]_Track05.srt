1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,770
Alchemy is a science where one understands the structure of matter, breaks it down, then rebuilds it.

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:11,480
However, it is not an all-powerful technique,
as one cannot create something out of nothing.

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,320
If one wishes to gain something,
one must present something of equal value.

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,030
This is the concept of equivalent exchange, the fundamental basis of alchemy.

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,620
However, there is a taboo in alchemy. Human transmutation.

6
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,330
One must not commit this act.

7
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,930
I've still got a lot of years ahead of me

8
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,930
Kono omoi wo keshiteshimau niwa

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,840
To just erase these feelings?

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,930
Mada jinsei nagai desho?

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:35,890
To just erase these feelings?

12
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:35,930
To just erase these feelings?

13
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,930
Yarinokoshiteru koto

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,930
I want to go back and finish

15
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,560
The things that I've yet to finish.

16
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,560
Yarinaoshite mitai kara

17
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:58,830
I was supposed to be chasing after my ongoing dream,

18
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:58,830
Yume no tsuzuki oikaketeita hazu nanoni

19
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:05,170
Yet I faltered over others while walking this thin, winding path.

20
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:05,170
Magarikunetta hosoi michi hito ni tsumazuku

21
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,340
It's not that I want to return to those days.

22
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,340
Ano koro mitainitte modoritai wake ja nai no

23
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,840
I'm searching for the sky I lost.

24
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,840
Nakushitekita sora wo sagashiteru

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,510
Don't make that sad face, as if you've fallen victim.

26
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,510
Wakatte kuremasu youni

27
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:18,720
Gisei ni natta youna kanashii kao wa yameteyo

28
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:18,720
As if you want people to pity you.

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,430
Tears aren't the end of your sins.

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,430
Tsumi no saigo wa namida ja nai yo

31
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,100
You have to bear them painfully, forever.

32
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,100
Zutto kurushiku seottekunda

33
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,770
Who are you waiting for in the maze of emotions,

34
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,770
Deguchi mienai kanjoumeiro ni

35
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,440
Where you can't even see the exit?

36
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,440
Dare wo matteruno?

37
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,230
I want to blurt it out more justly,

38
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,230
Shiroi nooto ni tsuzutta youni

39
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,980
Just like how I wrote it in my white notebook.

40
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,980
Motto sunao ni hakidashitai yo

41
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,650
What do you want to run from?

42
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,650
Nani kara nogaretainda

43
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,280
That thing called "reality"?

44
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,280
Genjitsu tte yatsu?

45
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,610
I just want to scream out,

46
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,610
Kanaeru tame ni ikiterundatte

47
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,030
"I'm only living to fulfill my wish." Can you hear me?

48
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,030
Sakebitaku naru yo kikoeteimasuka?

49
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,160
I can't take the safe way out of everything.

50
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,160
Bunan ni nante yatterarenaikara

51
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,960
I don't even have a place to return to.

52
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,960
Kaeru basho mo nai no

53
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,250
I'm always thankful for everyone's kindness,

54
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,250
Yasashisa ni wa itsumo kansha shiteru

55
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,630
That's why I want to become stronger. (I'm on the way)

56
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,630
Dakara tsuyoku naritai (I'm on the way)

57
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,590
This is reminding me of the old days.

58
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,590
Natsukashiku naru

59
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,840
This pain is all right with me.

60
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,840
Konna itami mo kangei jan

61
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,050
Brother.

62
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:06,930
Hm?

63
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,760
What do you think about the rumors of the High Priest of Lior?

64
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,430
Miracles, huh?

65
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,100
He creates flowers out of nothingness, right?

66
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,650
It could just be a sleight of hand, but...

67
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,480
But if it isn't...

68
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,990
Yeah... It could be what we've been looking for.

69
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,450
A heavenly stone that destroyed Xerxes overnight.

70
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,080
The great elixir that had been sealed away by a sage from the west.

71
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,880
There are many names for it, but to put it simply, it is something that reinforces alchemy.

72
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,000
That is the Philosopher's Stone.

73
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,880
If we had this, we could get your body back...

74
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,510
Dammit! Why is this all that's written down?!

75
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,010
Al.

76
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,180
Yeah?

77
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,520
Wouldn't it be great if it's the real stone this time?

78
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,650
Yeah. Definitely.

79
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,550
The First Day

80
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,530
10 Years Ago   Resembool

81
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,530
Ed, Al, where are you?

82
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,030
Oh my...

83
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,530
Scattering Daddy's studies again.

84
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,990
Hey, no doodling on the floor.

85
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,660
I'm not doodling.

86
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,200
Watch!

87
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,870
That's... alchemy, isn't it?

88
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,040
Did you learn that from Daddy?

89
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,590
How do we learn from someone who's not even here?

90
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,840
It was in the books we read.

91
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,260
Was in the books...

92
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,260
Were we not supposed to?

93
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,260
No, of course not!

94
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,310
You boys are amazing! As expected of Daddy's children.

95
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,140
I'm going to have to brag to everyone about you two!

96
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,440
Mom praised us.

97
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,150
Because we liked that, we started getting into alchemy.

98
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,530
But... in the summer of that year...

99
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,160
Mom passed away due to an epidemic.

100
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,210
Brother... I'm hungry.

101
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,170
It's cold, too. Let's go home...

102
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,130
If Dad comes home-

103
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,630
Don't talk about him!

104
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,510
He's not our Dad!

105
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,430
He didn't even come back for Mom's funeral.

106
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,400
I wonder if we could bring Mom back...

107
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,740
But one of the books said that
transmutating humans isn't allowed.

108
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,530
So... We'll keep it between us, all right?

109
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,330
You guys are here again.

110
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,250
What do you want, Winry?

111
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:46,460
Grandma said that if you cry for someone who's passed away, that person grieves as much as you cried for them.

112
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,960
We're not crying!

113
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:56,720
You're the one who cries all the time 'cause
your parents are always gone and you're lonely!

114
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,220
I-I never cry!

115
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,850
Really?

116
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,940
I'm sorry I was ever worried about you now!

117
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,570
If you get home later than me, you don't get any supper!

118
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,190
What the heck is that? Wait up!

119
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,570
W-Wait for me!

120
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,860
Itadakimasu!

121
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,120
Ed, you have to drink your milk, too.

122
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,040
I hate milk.

123
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,120
If you don't drink it, you'll be a runt forever.

124
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,750
Who are you calling a runt, you midget hag!

125
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,750
What was that?! You pea-sized runt!

126
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,210
Minimum hag!

127
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,250
Micro runt!

128
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,260
You're no bigger than an ant!

129
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,630
You're no bigger than a flea!

130
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,680
You were reading your book in school again...

131
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,560
You have to pay attention in class, you know.

132
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,310
Oh, shut up.

133
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,140
So, what book were you reading?

134
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,400
It's a secret.

135
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,650
None of your business, Winry.

136
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,440
That's no fair! You two always keep little secrets!

137
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,820
Later!

138
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,660
Ed! Al! We're having stew tonight!

139
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,200
Awesome!

140
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,500
Okay. We'll see you later!

141
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,500
The person who invented stew is amazing.

142
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,210
There's milk in it, yet it tastes so good.

143
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,380
What the heck?

144
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,090
The fact they thought of adding milk to vegetable soup is amazing.

145
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,300
It's important for scientists to drastically change their thinking sometimes.

146
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,850
I wonder...

147
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,270
Yeah!

148
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,850
Human transmutation probably needs something drastic like that, too!

149
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,320
From then on, we researched human transmutation...

150
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:38,120
...and improved our abilities by training with
our alchemy master in order to revive our mother.

151
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,870
It took many years, but...

152
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,250
"I want to see Mom's smiling face again."

153
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,580
"I want to live happily with Mom again."

154
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,290
With those thoughts in our hearts, we...

155
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,640
There.

156
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,020
Water, 35L.

157
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,890
Carbon, 20kg.

158
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,650
Ammonia, 4L.

159
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,900
Lime, 1.5kg.

160
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,650
Phosphorus, 800g.

161
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,690
Salt, 250g.

162
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,700
Niter, 100g.

163
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,660
Sulfur, 80g.

164
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,660
Fluorine, 7.5g.

165
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,200
Iron, 5g.

166
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,910
Silicon, 3g.

167
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,540
All right, let's write the construction formula.

168
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,750
All that's left is the information about the soul.

169
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,130
Let's do this, Al.

170
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,090
Right.

171
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,820
Brother, something's wrong.

172
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,870
Al!

173
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,250
Could this be... rebound?!

174
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:09,960
Brother!!!

175
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,130
Brother! Brother...

176
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,250
Brother!

177
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,050
BROTHER!!!

178
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,390
Al?

179
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,430
Huh? What was I doing?

180
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,140
Yo.

181
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,310
Who're you?

182
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,650
Why, thanks for asking.

183
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,360
I'm an existence that you folks like to call the "world".

184
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,410
In other words, the universe. In other words, God.

185
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:44,370
In other words, the "Truth". In other words, entirety.

186
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,160
In other words, "one". And, I'm...

187
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,540
...you.

188
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,000
Welcome.

189
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,920
Mr. I'm-an-idiot-who-acts-all-high-and-mighty.

190
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,470
So noisy...

191
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,720
Isn't this what you wanted?

192
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,230
I'll show you the "truth".

193
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,200
It was as though all of the information in the world was shoved directly into my head.

194
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,450
Stop it! My head's gonna burst!

195
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,290
I'm being disassembled...

196
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:38,050
No! Stop it!

197
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,590
Stop!!!

198
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,930
I felt like my head was going to crack open.

199
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,470
But I suddenly realized.

200
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,390
This is the "Truth".

201
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,270
M... Mom...

202
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,400
How was it?

203
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,030
That's right...

204
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:08,950
There were no errors in my human transmutation theory...

205
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,160
But I'm missing something!

206
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,460
If I had gone a little further...

207
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,880
I would've found what I was looking for; the truth to human transmutation!

208
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,250
Please! Show it to me again!

209
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,170
No, no, no.

210
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,470
I can only show you that much for that toll you've paid.

211
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,930
Toll?

212
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,800
Yes, toll.

213
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,480
Equivalent exchange, is it not?

214
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,480
Mr. Alchemist.

215
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:50,200
Dammit! Like I'd let this happen...

216
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,700
This... This wasn't...

217
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,580
Dammit!!!

218
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,330
They took it away!!!

219
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,210
Help me... someone...

220
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,510
Mom... Mom...

221
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,690
No way... No...

222
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,690
This isn't...

223
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,740
This isn't what I wanted!!!

224
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,570
Al... Alphonse...

225
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,790
Alphonse! Alphonse!!!

226
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,330
Because of me...

227
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,500
Alphonse!!!

228
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,960
Dammit... Dammit!!!

229
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:46,210
Give him back... He's my little brother...

230
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,590
Whether it be an arm or a leg...

231
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,840
Or even my heart! You can take it!

232
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,430
So give him back...

233
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:56,680
He's my only brother!!!

234
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,280
Yo. You were still hangin' around in Central?

235
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,530
They're letting me return to Eastern Headquarters.

236
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,410
Well, good work.

237
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,540
You'd better at least be a Brigadier General the next time you come, all right, Colonel?

238
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,160
You say that as if it's a walk in the park.

239
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,250
Oh yeah, if you're going back,
I'll go ahead and give this to you now.

240
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,210
What is it?

241
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,550
It's the final report about Isaac McDougal.

242
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,720
You haven't seen it yet, have you?

243
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,100
Yeah.

244
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,890
Eastern Alchemy from Xing?

245
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,020
Apparently, something like that exists.

246
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,900
To be honest, I've got no idea, but...

247
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,020
Do you have a clue?

248
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,070
No, never heard of it.

249
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,030
By the way, how are the Elric brothers doing?

250
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,820
I'm not their keeper.

251
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,700
Hey, why did you have Ed become a State Alchemist?

252
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,870
He's still a kid, you know?

253
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:04,080
As long as you're in the army,
you will experience Hell someday.

254
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,000
Just like we did.

255
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,680
Hell, huh...

256
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:18,010
If it's Hell, they've seen it already.

257
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,640
Plenty of it, in fact...

258
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:25,060
4 Years Later

259
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,570
Lt. Colonel, they're not in the backyard ei-

260
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,450
What is this...

261
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,740
Where are they?

262
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,870
Where are those Elric brothers?!

263
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,620
Pipe down, Den.

264
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,500
To customers, you have to...

265
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,340
Hey! What business does a soldier have here?

266
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,260
I just came from your house!

267
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,430
What in the world is all that?!

268
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,930
What did you make?!

269
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:04,810
Sorry... Please forgive us.

270
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,320
We're sorry... We're sorry...

271
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,360
We're sorry...

272
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,940
You're...

273
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,570
I was shocked.

274
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,740
I heard there was a talented alchemist, so I came here.

275
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:25,000
To think that a child performed human transmutation, though it was incomplete,

276
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,340
and even managed to affix a soul.

277
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:33,220
He has more than enough to be a State Alchemist.

278
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:39,970
If he became a State Alchemist, he'd have to fight as a soldier during times of emergencies.

279
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:45,060
At the same time, the position comes with many privileges, and they'd be allowed to perform research of the highest level.

280
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,900
They may be able to discover
a way to recover their bodies...

281
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:58,070
After these boys staggered in here
covered in blood, I went to their house.

282
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,620
That...

283
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,040
That was not human!

284
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,540
Is alchemy what allowed them to create something horrible like that?!

285
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,090
Then I'm against it!

286
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,670
Are you telling these boys to look at Hell again?!

287
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,050
Please.

288
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,680
Thank you.

289
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,600
Umm... Lieutenant...

290
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,770
Just call me Riza.

291
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,310
Riza Hawkeye. Nice to meet you.

292
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,610
Ms. Riza...

293
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,990
Have you ever shot somebody?

294
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,830
I have.

295
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,870
I don't like soldiers.

296
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:51,790
Because Mom and Dad were taken to a battlefield and killed there.

297
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:57,470
And on top of that, you two are trying to take Ed and Al, too...

298
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:02,100
Whether they come or not is up to them.

299
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,970
Yes... up to them.

300
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,640
I won't force you.

301
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,100
I'm just presenting you with the possibilities.

302
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,230
Whether they want to move forward or stay stuck in place.

303
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:17,740
Whether you want to end your life in despair or bow down to the army, seeking what possibilities lie there.

304
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,990
It's those boys who have to make the decision.

305
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:27,410
If the possibility lies on that path, then you should move forward to return your body to normal.

306
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:31,250
Even if that path is a muddy river.

307
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,380
Why did you become a soldier, Ms. Riza?

308
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,560
Because I have someone I want to protect.

309
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,850
We're leaving.

310
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:51,690
Yes, sir.

311
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,940
Well, this is good-bye, young lady.

312
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,950
My name is Winry.

313
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,490
I see. Winry.

314
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,450
I hope we'll meet again.

315
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,080
I wonder if he'll come?

316
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,040
He will.

317
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,710
But his eyes looked spiritless...

318
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,710
You think so?

319
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,550
Those... were burning eyes.

320
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,180
You won't regret it, will you?

321
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,480
Nope, I've already decided.

322
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,690
How long would it take for both the surgery and rehab?

323
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,610
I'd say about three years.

324
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,610
One year.

325
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,240
You're gonna be coughing up blood.

326
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,200
Al, put up with it for a little longer, will ya?

327
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,460
I'll put you back in your body.

328
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,370
Yeah.

329
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,630
But when that time comes,
you're going to get your limbs back, too.

330
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:57,840
Yeah.

331
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,890
Your body's all fixed up now, don't you think?

332
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:16,230
Yeah! Just alchemy left to train now.

333
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,270
Since I haven't used it since.

334
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:22,530
Oh, so you haven't used it since you affixed my soul.

335
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:28,530
Brother!

336
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,910
Perfect, perfect.

337
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,750
That's amazing, Brother! You did it without a transmutation circle!

338
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,710
Just like how our master does it!

339
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,920
You can do it, too, can't you?

340
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,710
No, Brother.

341
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,920
You didn't see it?

342
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,130
See... what?

343
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,760
No... never mind.

344
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,600
Hey!!

345
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,220
You transformed my automail, didn't you?!

346
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,890
So you're gonna transform my head instead?!

347
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,520
Ow... geez...

348
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,650
Uncute machine freak.

349
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,490
Like I care if I'm not cute!

350
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:04,990
I'm fine with being a machine freak, too!

351
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:09,990
I've decided to support you until you get your limbs back!

352
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,530
Wha?

353
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,250
It's quite rare that you've decided to watch the exam, sir.

354
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:21,170
Well, I heard that a twelve year-old was being tested,

355
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:24,300
so I just thought I'd drop by so I would have something to talk about with my family.

356
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,930
Ah, an arm made of steel...

357
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,970
I got it during the civil war in the west...

358
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,680
Yeah, we sure had a lot of trouble with Ishbal.

359
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,890
Who's that guy?

360
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,610
Idiot! That's Führer President King Bradley!

361
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,030
Now, let the examination begin.

362
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,870
Do you have something to draw a transmutation circle with?

363
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,660
I don't need something like that.

364
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,500
Without a transmutation circle...

365
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,560
Now this is quite something...

366
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:17,390
Your Excellency!

367
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,360
...And some military figure may be assassinated like this, so...

368
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,610
You guys might want to think about changing this examination.

369
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:38,080
Hmm, he's certainly got a lot of pluck.

370
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,540
But he doesn't understand the size of this world.

371
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:51,800
Good luck with the rest of your exams, young alchemist.

372
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,430
When did he draw his sword?

373
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,560
I wonder if Brother is doing all right on the exams...

374
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,770
Hey, Al.

375
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,480
Hm? What's up?

376
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,650
If Ed becomes a State Alchemist...

377
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,110
...will you be leaving this town?

378
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:16,280
Yeah.

379
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:21,920
This is the badge of a State Alchemist, the silver pocket watch.

380
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,670
East City
Eastern Headquarters

381
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Your certificate and the agreements are... here...

382
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,920
The Führer President has given you quite the ironic title...

383
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,130
What?

384
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,970
No, congratulations.

385
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,600
You're now a dog of the military.

386
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,470
I, Führer President King Bradley, hereby appoint...

387
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:44,190
...thou, Edward Elric, as a State Alchemist,

388
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,860
and bestow thee with the title, "Fullmetal".

389
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,360
Fullmetal?

390
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,690
That's right.

391
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:53,910
The second name that's given to all State Alchemists.

392
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,490
The name that you'll be carrying is...

393
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,530
"Fullmetal Alchemist".

394
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,500
I like it. Sounds like something heavy to carry.

395
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,380
But I'll do it.

396
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,630
Brother, we're almost there.

397
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,060
Lior, huh...

398
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:24,270
There should be some clue there on how to get Al's body back...

399
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,060
The Philosopher's Stone...

400
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:33,090
Say, the sky we saw that day, the scarlet sky.

401
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:33,090
Ano hi mita sora akaneiro no sora wo

402
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:38,310
Do you remember it from that day?

403
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:38,310
Nee kimi wa oboeteimasuka

404
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:44,230
We made a promise and a vow while the early summer wind circled us.

405
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:44,230
Yakusoku chigiri shoka no kaze ga tsutsumu

406
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,480
And we clung close together.

407
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,480
Futari yorisotta

408
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:57,530
Your forced smile

409
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:57,530
Muri na egao no ura

410
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:02,910
Holds elongated shadows.

411
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:02,910
Nobita kage wo kakumau

412
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:12,170
I pretend not to notice and continue on.

413
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:12,170
Dakara kizukanu furi saisei wo erabu

414
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:21,680
All the while waiting for you to deliver some news at the table.

415
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:21,680
Teeburu no ue no furuenai shirase machitsuzukete

416
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:30,070
Empty nights, mornings that will never arrive,

417
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:30,070
Kuuhaku no yoru mo kuru hazu no nai asa mo

418
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:34,820
I could see them from a mile away.

419
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:34,820
Zenbu wakattetanda

420
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:40,450
Say, the sky we saw that day, the scarlet sky.

421
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:40,450
Ano hi mita sora akaneiro no sora wo

422
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:45,370
I'm sure you'll remember it one day.

423
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:45,370
Nee itsuka omoidasu deshou

424
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:51,210
While holding the promise we couldn't keep,

425
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:51,210
Hatasenakatta yakusoku wo idaite

426
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:55,470
We take our first steps down our own paths.

427
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:55,470
Futari arukidasu

428
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:06,100
Ed and Al, arriving in the city of Lior, meet Cornello, a man who preaches the revival of the dead.

429
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,140
Pray and believe, and thou shall be saved.

430
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,520
As Cornello preached those words, he wore the bright, red, Philosopher's Stone on his finger.

431
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:19,110
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:

432
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,120
City of Heresy

433
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,780
Episode 3, City of Heresy.

434
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:26,410
What, exactly, is the happiness that can be earned by turning away from reality?
