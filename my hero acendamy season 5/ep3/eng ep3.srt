3

This voice...

4
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,370
I will never forget this voice!

5

6
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,040
As long as you are willing to aid my cause,

7
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,250
I will give you what you desire.

8

9

10
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,790
Did you skip your meal again?

11
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,160
Poor thing. There's barely anything left of you.

12
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,500
I'll...

13
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,200
never let you do as you please!

14
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,950
Reality doesn't always go as we planned.

15
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,870
Now, I will cleanse you of your defiance.

16
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,080
You mean a lot to me.

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,580
Stop it.

18
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,120
I found a power even
a weakling as you can wield.

19
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,450
Join my cause.

20
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,620
Stop!

21
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:32,450
You must be the ninth wielder.

22
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:36,000
I wanted to show you more.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,620
But 20% is all I can conjure for now.

24
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,370
Stay cautious.

25

IZUKU MIDORIYA

00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:52,370
I couldn't sleep after that dream.

00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,910
Midoriya?

41
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,290
What was that ruckus?

42

No, it's nothing!

43

"AOYAMA YUGA, QUIRK: NAVEL LASER"
Are you under a lot of stress lately?

45
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,250
Did you not have enough cheese?

46
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,700
I think so.

47
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,580
I'm sorry if I woke you up.

48
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,660
It was clearly a dream.

49
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,410
But I remember every detail.

50
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,450
That moment when his hand touched mine...

51
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,450
When the dream came to an end,

52
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,750
I saw the previous wielders...

53
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,659
"ALL MIGHT, QUIRK: ONE FOR ALL"
You saw the memories...

54
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:52,790
of the previous wielders?

55
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,950
Yes, I think so.

56
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,620
It was also All For One's memory.

57
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,750
One For All's look...

58
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,910
You must have seen him when you were younger.

59
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,250
Indeed.

60
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,830
After I saw my master,

61
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:17,370
my predecessor told me about
the existence of that vestige.

62
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,080
I was able to tell you the ins and outs
of their past because I saw it too.

63
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,830
I only saw the memory up until
he was given the power.

64
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:30,790
Then the first wielder told me
he could only show me 20% of it.

65
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,620
He also mentioned a singularity.

66
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,909
That's all he told me.

67
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:42,290
All Might, you said the memory I saw
during the sports day borne no meaning,

68
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,540
but I think it did.

69
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,700
He talked to the first wielder?

70
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,750
I never experienced that.

71
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,290
My master said the same thing.

72
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:00,500
As far as I know, the first wielder
only talked to you.

73
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,660
That wasn't a dream.

74
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,500
It was a vestige.

75
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,750
Master, what do you mean by that?

76
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:17,700
That Quirk must have accumulated
many thoughts over time.

77
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,410
"I want to do it, I must do it."

78
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:24,000
"I want to become this, I must become that."

79
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,790
When it concerns power,

80
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,040
people will have their own thoughts about it.

81
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,450
People who cultivated that power all this time,

82
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,080
their thoughts became part of the power
and are embedded as memories.

83
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,620
That's what I think.

84
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,620
Is this considered supernatural?

85
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,290
It's romantic.

86
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,000
Even if we fall,

87
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
we can still reunite in One For All.

88
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,830
Isn't that romantic?

89
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:00,330
All Might...All Might?

90
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,830
So you woke up after the surge of energy?

91
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,870
Were you hurt?

92
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,200
Not at all.

93
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,250
I'm glad to hear that.

94
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,750
Judging by the circumstances,

95
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,370
we only have details I can't understand so far.

96
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,370
That's all there is for now.

97
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,620
But about that singularity...

98
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:25,040
Could this have something to do with
Quirk Singularity Theory?

99
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,910
The Quirks are inherited from parents,

100
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,700
and continue to mix,
growing in complexity with every new generation.

101
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:35,659
Quirks will develop to a point
where it becomes too complex...

102
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:39,790
for anyone to have control over them.

103
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:42,330
That's what the theory says.

104
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,540
We have no way to prove this for the time being.

105
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,409
We don't know for sure if you were the cause...

106
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:49,909
or was there any external factor.

107
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,540
Was there anything noticeable?

108
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,750
Well...

109
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,409
There were two wielders I couldn't see clearly.

110
00:07:57,409 --> 00:08:00,290
Even your silhouette was blurry.

111
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,910
Was it because you were considered
one of the latest wielders?

112
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,080
I'm sorry.

113
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,410
I can't be sure about this either.

114
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:15,080
But that power is siding with you.

115
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,200
Let's find the answer together.

116
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,410
Yes, I won't give up so easily.

117
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,540
And by the way...

118
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,870
Your master...

119
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,080
She resembles my predecessor.

120
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,950
My mom?

121
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,250
It's their hairstyle.

122
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,159
Their hairstyle...

123
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,750

00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,450
so the mobility this suit grants you
is very beneficial.

165
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,870
I didn't ask for your compliment!

166
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,620
But your suit has gone through the most changes.

167
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,750
You added some new devices lately.

168
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,200
I can pull off more moves now.

169
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,500
These gloves are amazing.

"OCHACO URARAKA, QUIRK: ZERO GRAVITY"
This is the second iteration already.

171
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,830
Hatsume adjusted the strength output for me.

172
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,160
I see, it's Hatsume's work.

173
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,620

You all seem very relaxed.

177
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,370
Are we not worthy enough for you?

178
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,540

I prepared this during the School Festival!

207
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,540
The difference between Class A's live band
and our high-end drama!

Can't you see which got the better reviews?

We came out on top with two votes more than you!

Ever since school started,

211

you kept drawing attention by constantly
inviting bad news! But things have changed now!

For real?

I didn't watch their performance
so I can't say much about it.

Nice to meet you!

00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,000
He can brainwash you by talking to you, right?

It's a kill on first sight.

246
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,540
However,

247
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,580
Midoriya fell for his Quirk
but managed to broke free.

248

It was only a fluke.

00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,620
I saw One For All's vestiges...

250
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,200
because Shinso was controlling me.

251
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:25,000
It was the timing...

252
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,370
Or was it...

253
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,950
Shinso, do you have anything to say?

254
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,870
Your Quirk is brainwashing people?

255
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,660
You can basically control anyone you want.

256
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,000
You can do nasty things whenever you like.

257
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,330
No one would ever catch you.

258
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:45,370
Please don't do bad things to me.

259
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,620
That's what everyone says.

260
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,500
I'm Hitoshi Shinso.

261
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,120
Some of you have met me during the sports day.

262
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,000
They say a fight helps you know someone better.

263
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,620
But sadly, I'm not one who upholds
sportsmanship nor do I have friendliness.

264
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,540
I'm already falling behind all of you.

265
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,160
Sorry, but I must do my best.

266
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,910
You're already gifted, you wouldn't understand!

267
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,950
You were born with a Quirk meant for your dream!

268
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,790
You get to use it however you want,
so you wouldn't understand!

269
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,200
I want to be an outstanding hero.

270
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,830
I want to help people with my Quirk.

271
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:29,290
Each of you is a challenge I must overcome.

272
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,410
I don't plan to become your friend.

273
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,290
That's all from me.

274
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,000
I can feel his aura from here.

He seems interesting.

279
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,910
Without further a due, let's begin.

280
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,200
Battle drill, commence!

281
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,370
It's Class A against Class B.

282
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:57,700
It takes place somewhere in Ground Gamma.

283
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,500
There must be four students in each team,
and you take turns to battle.

284
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,250
Four students in one team?

285
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,370
That sounds fun.

286
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,660
I know!

287
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,450
But there will be 41 of us including Shinso.

288
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,500
What do we do with the remainder?

289
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,500
Shinso will participate in two battles.

290
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,620
One as Class A, and another as Class B.

291
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,200
He will battle against both classes.

292
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:18,790
Which means,

293
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:22,080
there will be two battles
where one team will have five students.

294
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,700
But the other team will be at a disadvantage.

295
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:29,000
Having the inexperienced Shinso
on their team is a disadvantage.

296
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,620
That should balance the number advantage.

297
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:39,450
The objective is to surround and
capture the enemies as heroes.

298
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:42,450
Both teams must see each other as villains.

299
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,250
The first team to capture four people wins.

300
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,870
Well, the villains are getting
more organized after all.

301
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,540
It's simple, I like it.

302
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,370
We are both the heroes and villains!

303
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,250
Which role should I play?

304
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,450
I think we can see ourselves as heroes.

305
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:01,950
There are super cute prisons for both teams.

306
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:05,250
As soon as the opponents are in it,
they will be disqualified.

307
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,330
It doesn't match the atmosphere!

308
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:12,370
It's most effective to render our opponents
unable to battle on their own base.

309
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:15,290
But I doubt it would be that simple.

310
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,620
The first to capture four wins.

311
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,580
So this is the balance they mentioned?

312
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,540
Huh?

313
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,910
Yes. With an unfamiliar member on your team,

314
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,660
you'll have five members.

315
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,580
But as long as four are captured, you lose.

316
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:31,290
You want us to carry a dead weight around?

317
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,250
This is lame.

318
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,580
Don't be so rude.

319
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,450
I'm fine with that. It's true.

320
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:40,250
His politeness is way beyond our reach!

321
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,160
Well,

322
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,500
let's draw straws.

323
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,580
CLASS A VS CLASS B

324
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,620
FIRST BATTLE

325
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,120
SECOND BATTLE

326
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,620
THIRD BATTLE

327
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,120
FOURTH BATTLE

328
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,620
FIFTH BATTLE

329
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,579
Shinso, it's your turn to draw.

330
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:07,250
The number will decide which team you join.

331
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,869
We heard what you said earlier,

332
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:12,290
but let's work as a team.

333
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,250
Nice to meet you!

334
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,160
Could you tell us more about your Quirk?

335
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,290
You have a handsome look.
The girls must like you a lot.

336
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,540
I can tell as much.

337
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,579
Nice to meet you.

338
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,619
Hey, you! Not bad!

339
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:24,369
Let's crush the cursed Class A together!

340
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:27,579
Please ignore his outrageous manner.

341
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:28,620
Nice to meet you.

342
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,160
Same goes for you!

343
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,910
Team five of Class B.

344
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,700
Deku and Shinso have matched
against each other again...

345
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,040
for the first time after the sports event.

346
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,200
The vestige of One For All still bugs me,

347
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,700
but for now...

348
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,660
I look forward to his improvements.

349
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,750
What does he going to show us this time?

350
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,290
Where did you pull that out?

351
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,160
The day has come.

352
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,580
I'm finally on the starting line.

353
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,870
The starting point is your base.

354
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,910
The time limit is 20 minutes.

355
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,620
If you can't settle the score in time,

356
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,500
the team with more remaining members wins.

357
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,500
All Might and Midnight are here!

358
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,450
Are they dating?

359
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,450
Give me a break, I don't like older guys.

360
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,620
"PRO HERO MIDNIGHT, QUIRK: SOMNAMBULIST"
Which team do you think will win?

361
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,540
It's hard to tell.

362
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,580
Class A has become much experienced
after so many crisis.

363
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,790
However,

364
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:28,160
Class B shows more growth
when it comes to results.

365
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,500
They could focus more on their lessons
without much troubles going on.

366
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,330
They steadily grow over time.

367
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:38,160
Would it be Class A that shows
true potential in the face of danger?

368
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,370
Or would it be Class B that shows
better overall improvement?

369
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,160
This is exciting.

370
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,040
First battle!

371
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,790
You're all fired-up.

372
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,120
Start!

373
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,870
We all know each other's abilities.

374
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:04,200
But to maintain life advantage,
we should stick together.

375
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,120
Asui's camouflage.

376
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,370
I can spot her if I know where to look.

377
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:11,410
So, I should keep my distance from you...

378
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,120
to shoot my one-million-volt lightning.

379
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,790
What if we got separated?

380
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,950
You'll be isolated.

381
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,580
You have a point.

382
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,950
Shiozaki can be quite the handful.

383
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,540
Her Quirk is so powerful.

384
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,910
The attack range is huge, and she annihilated me.

385
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,750
We should start with
the most challenging Quirk to deal with.

386
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,830
That's brilliant, Shinso.

387
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,660
That's just common sense.

388
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:42,580
Just like we want to take out Ibara first,

389
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:47,330
they will try to get rid of Kaminari too.

390
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:50,160
Then we have to deal with
our lack of experience.

391
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,080
Shinso's Brainwashing is very powerful.

392
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,370
I'm counting on all of you!

393
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,080
I hope we get to see Kaminari and Shinso
unleash their true strength.

394
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,040
Thank you.

395
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,330
Have you found them already?

396
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,160
Shiozaki is coming from the left side.

397
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,750
She seems to be alone.

398
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,160
She is spreading her vines to search for us
while heading our way.

399
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,950
Attacking a girl all at once leaves
a bad taste in my mouth.

400
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,500
Roaring Rage!

401
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,620
Kirishima! Tsuyu!

402
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:32,200
We knew Koda could track us down with ease.

403
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,830
Of course we expected you
to be wary of Shiozaki.

404
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:39,620
We used her as a decoy and closed in on you.

405
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:44,370
We isolated you to leave you to your own device.

406
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:47,290
So I seized the opening to attack!

407
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:50,080
My nose can sense anything!

408
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,540
Shishida Jurota.

409
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,160
Quirk: Beast.

410
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:00,540
Monster form drastically augments his strength,
speed, and durability, as well as his senses.

411
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,580
He also becomes more wild, making him reckless.

412
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,870
Now you can't electrocute
us without hurting your friends!

413
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,410
Denki Kaminari!

414
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,120
Check out the new move I developed!

415
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,410
Air Prison!

416
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:18,450
Not even sound can escape this space!

417
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,120
Okay, let's finish them off!

418
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,700
Leave it to me!

419
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,620
Are you kidding me?

420
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,250
He's been brainwashed.

421
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,870
That guy...

422
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,040
He spoke with my voice!

423
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,370
That mask...

424
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,330
It works as a vocal cord.

425
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:45,290

NEXT EPISODE

446
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,910
The clash between Class A and Class B.

447
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:28,620
The first battle has begun.

448
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,450
However,

449
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:33,000
Class B has strengthened their Quirks
with intensive training.

450
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,870
They are closing in on Class A.

451
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,540
Next episode, Make It Happen, Shinso!

452
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,790
Shinso's new ability,

453
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:45,290
the Persona Chords, will dominate this battle!
