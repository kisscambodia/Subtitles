00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,160
CLASS A VS CLASS B

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,040
Class 1-A and Class 1-B of U.A. High

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,950
are having a joint training.

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:15,080
After the third battle, each class
has won one battle so far.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,950
And now, the fourth battle will begin.

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,830
What? What is going on? For real?

7
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,620
You can't be serious with this.

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,870
That's it.

9
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,540
I'll show you what I've got, stupid Deku!

20
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:12,370
With Jiro and Sero on this battleground...

21
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:16,040
I have bad feeling about this.
They are both very tough opponents.

22
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,000
Not to mention Bakugo and
Sato are both powerful as well.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,410
Their team balance is impeccable.

24
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,410
It's best to assume they could wipe us out
if they have the upper hand.

25
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,829
Whatever it is,

26
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:29,000
we should chop them up now!

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,160
Let's strike them them with a preemptive attack!

28
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,620
EARLY BIRD!

29
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:42,079
Class A and Class B has each won one battle.

30
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:45,410
Do you think their strength is equal?

31
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:49,750
But Class A only won thanks to Shinso!

32
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,829
"VLAD KING, QUIRK: BLOOD CONTROL"
Well,

33
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:53,250
is their strength really on the same level?

34
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,450
King Vlad, that's too much!

35
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,540
"MIDNIGHT. QUIRK: SOMNAMBULIST"
He can control blood, but not his brain.

36
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,910
"ALL MIGHT, QUIRK: ONE FOR ALL"
He loves his student a little too much.

37
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,040
"SHOTA AIZAWA, QUIRK: ERASURE"
Are you done over there?

38
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,160
Sir, we are simply against this bias broadcast!

39
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,370
Are you going to protest if you lost a battle?

40
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,660
Class B's tactic is much more formidable
than you think.

41
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,620
That is a fact.

42
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,540
It seems like Vlad is the better teacher.

43
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,700
In the end, you're just troublemakers!

44
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,120
Don't you see that?

45
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,790
Only failures will cause trouble to themselves!

46
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,290
NEITO MONOMA, QUIRK: COPY

47
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,829
Class B has been training day and night
to improve their skills and Quirks.

48
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:41,660
But Class A should be capable of more than that.

49
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,410
All Might, you're still very fond of Class A.

50
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,620
I like all the students.

51
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,660
I look forward to your performance.

52
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,410
Young Bakugo...

53
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,000
Move faster, slowpokes!

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,450
I have to listen to their movement!

55
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,540
Stop nagging, just catch up!

56
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,950
"RIKIDO SATO, QUIRK: SUGAR RUSH"
He always wants us to catch up.

57
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,790
"HANTA SERO, QUIRK: TAPE"
He hasn't changed since the sports day.

58
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,080
"KYOKA JIRO, QUIRK: EARPHONE JACK"
In any case, he always helps out.

59
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,290
However...

60
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,120
Listen up, you second-rated jerks.

61
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,120
Just follow my lead.

62
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,500
Don't call us jerks.

63
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,120
And stop saying we are second-rated.

64
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,540
I'll take the lead into the battle.

65
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,080
"KATSUKI BAKUGO, QUIRK: EXPLOSION"
Your job is to provide me support.

66
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,410
Ears, check for any sound of their movement.
Find out where they are.

67
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,580
Stop calling me names. My name is Jiro!

68
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,410
Bakugo, are you going to attack them head-on?

69
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,790
Their team is mostly people
who can take counter our attacks.

70
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,409
Since we have Jiro with us,

71
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:38,450
we can look for an opening
and proceed with cautions.

72
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,120
Fools.

73
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,450
That is exactly why we should strike first.

74
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,830
We don't look for an opening.

75
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,159
We create it ourselves.

76
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:50,750
As long as we can track them down, we can win.

77
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,409
Do you get it now?

78
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:54,040
Be careful!

79
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,540
This is dangerous!

80
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,200
Hold onto those.

81
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,620
These aren't very powerful,
but they will come in handy.

82
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,330
And there's more.

83
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,450
Is he certain

84
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,500
this is the right tactic?

85
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,120
I spot someone!

86
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,910
Ear!

87
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,000
It's Jiro!

88
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,080
They are all in the area.

89
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,450
Find them!

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,450
Hurry up!

91
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,870
Be patient!

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,700
We fell for their trap!

93
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,540
Indeed. It's over for you.

94
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,330
We used Jiro's scouting ability
to our advantage.

95
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,790
Class B, Setsuna Tokage.

96
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,700
Hero name: Lizardy.

97
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,750
Quirk: Lizard Tail Splitter.

98
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,000
She can divide herself into parts
and control them at will.

99
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:20,370
After further improving her Quirks,
she can control up to 50 different parts!

100
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,540
Get out of my way!

101
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,620
Bakugo, over here!

102
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,660
All right, it's game over!

103
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,000
Glue Squall!

104
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,659
It's glue!

105
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:39,700
This is bad, we walked right into it.

106
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,750
It's like he created a web
to capture even himself!

107
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,790
I did it. It's just as Setsuna planned.

108
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,750
Class B, Kojiro Bondo.

109
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,290
Hero name: Plamo.

110
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,950
Quirk: Cemedine.

111
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,450
He can spray a large amount of glue

112
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,830
and adjust the rate at which it dries.

113
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,080
You are too slow!

114
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,080
Class B, Togaru Kamakiri.

115
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,040
Hero name, Jack Mantis.

116
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,580
Quirk: Razor Sharp.

117
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,200
He can produce large blades
from any part of his body.

118
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,160
We disrupted Jiro's hearing by making noises.

119
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,200
The pipelines and tapes are covered in adhesive.

120
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,540
There is no way to escape if they touch it.

121
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,370
I must protect them!

122
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,620
Bakugo!

123
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,580
The perfect timing!

124
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,000
I'll finish off Jiro first!

125
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,120
He saved his team and won the fight.

126
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,450
Win and save them all.

127
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:02,950
I'm much stronger than I used to be!

128
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,410
Don't forget,

129
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:13,410
when you're in danger, I will aid you.

130
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,040
You managed to withstand that.

131
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,790
You sure are fast as a bug!

132
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,370
For real?

133
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,950
Thanks!

134
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,200
Shut it!

135
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,290
They got away. Search for them.

136
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:33,159
I don't care if this is training or what.

137
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,539
I'd made up my mind long ago.

138
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:42,580
I must win every battle with undeniable victory!

139
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,620
I won't let them capture anyone!

140
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,160
That is...

141
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,000
the real victory for a true fighter!

142
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,700
This is strange.

143
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,200
Am I seeing things now?

144
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,950
I think he was protecting Jiro.

145
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,540
He did. But he also kicked her.

146
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,910
Bakugo is always so unpredictable.

147
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,950
Monoma, don't worry.

148
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,410
Your eyes are perfectly fine.

149
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,540
He changed his fighting style!

150
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,660
Yeah...

151
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,200
This is the first time I've seen him

152
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,450
standing out to protect others.

153
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:30,080
I shouldn't fight him head-on. Retreat.

154
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,410
If we get into a real fight,
there is no way we can win.

155
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,910
As soon as the capture operation failed,
we must retreat.

156
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,500
We must keep ambushing them

157
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,750
to maintain our advantage.

158
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,700
There are too much noises.

159
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,700
But the number has dwindled.

160
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,870
The number has dwindled?

161
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,450
They are falling back.

162
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,660
Are they regrouping?

163
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,500
Jerks, they are looking down on us.

164
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:08,660
They are a one-man team that follows
Bakugo's lead in any strategy.

165
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,790
We can keep baiting Bakugo
by giving him more pressure.

166
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,290
When he makes a mistake,
the team will crumble!

167
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,750
I can't locate them.

168
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,000
However,

169
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,290
I can recognize the sound if I concentrate!

170
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,660
Let's go!

171
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,660
They went into hiding!

172
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,250
They are using their Quirks again!

173
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,620
Construction-Done-Kwik,

174
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,950
Weldcraft!

175
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,540
Complete!

176
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,160
Class B, Yosetsu Awase.

177
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,660
Hero name: Welder.

178
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,160
Quirk: Weld.

179
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,540
He can fuse different objects
at a molecular level.

180
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,790
But he can't activate his ability
unless he touches the objects.

181
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,830
Impressive precision!

182
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,580
There is no way your tape can hit me
in this environment.

183
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,000
Is this part of Tokage's plan?

184
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,910
She foresees everything.

185
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,660
Sugar Rush!

186
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,910
Go!

187
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,000
Curse you! Don't you dare stick me to the pipes!

188
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,290
Do you have to be so upset?

189
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,200
I'm counting on you!

190
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,250
Leave it

191
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,620
to me!

192
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:35,700
When you're in danger, I will aid you.

193
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,700
On the other hand,

194
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,120
when I'm in trouble...

195
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,500
Heartbeat Surround!

196
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,910
I'll count on you guys to help me out.

197
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,910
Awase!

198
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,790
He's headed for Bondo!

199
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,700
This can't be happening!

200
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,750
I'm feeling great in this winter day!

201
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,910
Do you feel warm now?

202
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,040
I got him!

203
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:24,580
Their coordination is flawless!

204
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,950
They captured two of my lovely students
in a blink of an eye!

205
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,160
I thought he knew nothing about teamwork...

206
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,540
He didn't just gain a nicer personality...

207
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,120
Bakugo!

208
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,910
Bakugo is decisive.

209
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,540
The others assist his attack.

210
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,200
There will be some gaps in between.

211
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,200
We can make use of those gaps
and crush them from within!

212
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,910
That should do it!

213
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:59,000
Explode-A-Pult!

214
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:05,330
How? Their teamwork is perfect!

215
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,620
OCHACCO URARAKA, QUIRK: ZERO GRAVITY

216
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,290
Bakugo let them attack freely
because he trusts his teammates!

217
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,950
Their coordination worked.

218
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,000
His drumming practice was useful after all.

219
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:23,410
Tokage can split her body into 50 parts
and control them freely.

220
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,660
But the separated parts will stop moving
after a certain time.

221
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,120
Then the parts will regenerate from
her main body.

222
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,200
If that assumption is correct,

223
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,660
there must be a limit to how much
she can regenerate.

224
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,620
Just as Yaoyorozu,

225
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,790
she will be worn out
and her level of concentration will drop.

226
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,450
If she split her body into parts to make noises,

227
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:51,750
that would work against her regeneration.

228
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:58,410
Which means these parts will return to her body
to reform and reset.

229
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:04,080
Jiro mentioned there were less sounds,
that proves my hypothesis!

230
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,580
That was close.

231
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,830
You...

232
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,330
How much have you changed?

233
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,700
I've always been the same.

234
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,700
Whenever it is, my goal...

235
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,700
is to become the No.1 Hero
that surpasses All Might!

236
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:39,250
What...

237
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:40,790
WELCOME

238
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:44,790
In less than five minutes,

239
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,370
Class A's flawless teamwork

240
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,790
won the battle without losing any teammate!

241
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
KATSUKI BAKUGO, QUIRK: EXPLOSION

242
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
HIS SWEAT CAN CAUSE EXPLOSION LIKE NITROGLYCERIN

243
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
AFFILIATION: U.A. HIGH CLASS 1-A
BIRTHDAY: APRIL 20, HEIGHT 172CM

245
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
KYOKA JIRO, QUIRK: EARPHONE JACK

246
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
THE EXTENSION JACK FROM HER EARS
CAN CAUSE SONIC BOOM INSIDE HER ENEMY

247
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
AFFILIATION: U.A. HIGH SCHOOL CLASS 1-A

BLOOD TYPE: A
FAVORITE: ROCK MUSIC

249
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,750
There was no unnecessary casualty.

250
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,450
The capturing operation was swift and smooth.

251
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:10,660
Bakugo acted as the main attacker
with his mobility and firepower.

252
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,040
The other three coordinated well.

253
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:19,330
You came up with a tactic based on past data
while considering the difference in power.

254
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:24,040
But you didn't adapt to the situation.
You lack Honezuki's flexibility.

255
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,450
We failed miserably because of my mistake.

256
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:30,410
Never mind, let's take as a learning experience.

257
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,700
That impulsive guy won't go for an ambush
when he calms down.

258
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,000
You got that right.

259
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,870
That was surprising for sure.

260
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,370
Kacchan, there is nothing you can't do!

261
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,950
Jiro stole the spotlight as well!

262
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,750
I'm a hero, OK?

263
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,250
You look like a stray kitty
taken in by a delinquent.

264
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,120
I'm a human being, all right?

265
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,580
I was shivering.

266
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,700
Did you catch a cold or something?

267
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,500
Kacchan!

268
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,660
Stand aside, junk!

269
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,370
But I'm not even in your way...

270
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,120
IZUKU MIDORIYA, QUIRK: ONE FOR ALL

271
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,790
I've moved forward even more.

272
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,160
Indeed. You were amazing.

273
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,620
I'll become stronger at a pace
you can't catch up.

274
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,410
I will surpass you.

275
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:26,500
Shut it! Was that supposed to be a threat?

276
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,160
There is no way I would let you surpass me!

277
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,910
You useless trash!

278
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,660
We'll see about that.

279
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,660
You have a great childhood friend.

280
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,870
Jerk!

281
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,500
I wish his attitude could be better.

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,500
HITOSHI SHINSO, QUIRK: BRAINWASH

283
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,200
That hysteric explosion guy...

284
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,540
This is going to be fun.

285
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,330
Sorry, Monoma.

286
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,500
One win, two defeats, and one draw.

287
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,869
There is no way we can win this.

288
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:08,410
Your apology is not needed, Tokage.

289
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:12,200
Your teammates will learn from their mistakes.

290
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,040
Isn't that a great experience?

291
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:19,200
It's true Class B can't win,
but we haven't lost yet.

292
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,700
But I want all of you to understand one thing.

293
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,869
The people who get serious
and don't become a liability,

294
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:30,040
the attention seeker who
resort to unpleasant means,

295
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,830
who is on the correct path?

296
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:36,950
We are all supporting characters
of others' lives.

297
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,580
But we are the protagonists of our own lives!

298
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,120
"REIKO YANAGI, QUIRK: POLTERGEIST"
What do we do then?

299
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,790
Don't get so discouraged!

300
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,580
"NIRENGEKI SHODA, QUIRK: TWIN IMPACT"
I think it's best to follow

301
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,000
Tokage's tactic.

302
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,120
In terms of team balance,
both teams have almost the same composition.

303
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,000
Most of us have technical Quirks.

304
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,290
There are various ways to launch an ambush.

305
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,750
Most importantly, we have five combatants
on our team.

306
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,790
Head-on battles won't do us any good.

307
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:10,500
After watching the last battle,
I feel great resentment towards Midoriya.

308
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,040
Resentment?

309
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,750
That's her way of saying "scary".

310
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,830
Midoriya...

311
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:26,200
His mobility and power is on par with Bakugo's,
if not better.

312
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,040
He even learned ranged attacks recently.

313
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,870
If we make the slightest mistake,
we'll be decimated as the last team.

314
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,370
Midoriya will break through our defense.

315
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:41,000
Then let's make Midoriya our priority.

316
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,120
We must take him down first.

317
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:48,410
But he is capable of breaking my Brainwash.

318
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:49,540
However,

319
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,500
with Monoma's Quirk,

320
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,750
there might be a way to subdue Midoriya.

321
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,040
I feel a little daunted with the high hopes.

322
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,160
"YUI KODAI, QUIRK: SIZE"
After all, there is a chance it might fail.

323
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,370
It might fail?

324
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,950
That means he can't copy his opponent's Quirk.

325
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:04,750
I see...

326
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:09,160
Well, we must stop him if we want to win.

327
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,410
We're counting on you, Shinso.

328
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,790
The fifth battle is the last round.

329
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,160
How will Shinso perform?

330
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,160
The battle is a test to see if he is qualified
to transfer into the Hero Course.

331
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,120
He put up a great performance
in the first battle.

332
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,290
But the same trick might not work twice.

333
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,830
That's true enough.

334
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,660
Class A is very strong too.

335
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,620
I wish him all the best.

336
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,620
We should first deal with Shinso.

337
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,410
"MINORU MINETA, QUIRK: POP OFF"
I'm worried.

338
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,450
I don't want to get brainwashed.

339
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,660
"MINA ASHIDO, QUIRK: ACID"
Don't dwell on that.

340
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,700
They are capable of many ways

341
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,200
to ambush us without even showing themselves.

342
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,870
And our Quirks...

343
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:56,830
I can float.

344
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,830
I can melt!

345
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,040
I can stick!

346
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,700
This is not looking good.

347
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,330
I have a bad feeling about this.

348
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,290
We can't go on defensive nor offensive.

349
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,120
Very well!

350
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,250
We should use my Gloves that Pluck!

351
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,450
No one would fall for that.

352
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,040
We must find them and
let them fall into our trap.

353
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,910
I will act as the decoy.

354
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,080
Deku...

355
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,160
But how?

356
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,370
You mentioned your Quirk was acting weird.

357
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,410
I'll be fine.

358
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,290
But after watching the fourth battle,

359
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:43,330
my guess is they will be wary of me.

360
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:46,000
I must be even more mobile.

361
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,370
Are you sure about this?

362
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,330
We are counting on you to win.

363
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,200
Don't worry.

364
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,200
We will win!

365
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:04,950
The old you would have panicked instead.

366
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,160
Everything feels normal.

367
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,910
I've moved forward even more.

368
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:16,370
I'll become stronger at a pace
you can't catch up.

369
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,200
He left me with a challenge.

370
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,950
I mustn't let everyone down!

371
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,830
5TH BATTLE

372
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:30,700
All right! It's the fifth battle!

373
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,950
This is the last round.

374
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,700
Are you ready?

375
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:44,410
Never let your guard down! All the best!

376
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,000

Next episode.

397
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,830
It's the final battle of the joint training.

398
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:29,370
Class A will only need a
draw to secure the victory.

399
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,080
But we mustn't be complacent.

400
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,450
Class B has Shinso on their team.

401
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:36,410
There is also Monoma who can copy our Quirks.

402
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,290
I'm the key to win this battle.

403
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,200
That's why I must strike!

404
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,540
Next episode, "That Which Is Inherited".

405
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:46,080
An anomaly manifests inside of me
during the battle.

406
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,290
Go beyond!

407
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:50,000
Plus Ultra!
