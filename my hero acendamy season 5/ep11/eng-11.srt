00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,450
Why?

2
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:09,870
What is this?

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,040
Aizawa! Vlad!

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,040
We should stop him now.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,580
It's not looking good.

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,750
Deku, calm down!

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,620
Shinso!

8
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,290
Brainwash him now!

9
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,950
Help me stop Deku!

10
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,870
Midoriya!

11
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,250
Fight me!

12
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,450
Yes!

13
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:18,620
Release.

14
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,660
Fire!

15
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,039
Nice timing!

16
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:27,750
Are you two all right?

17
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,750
Eat this!

18
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,039
Midoriya! Uraraka! Are you all right?

19
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:34,830
Everyone is here.

20
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,620
Let's get ready to rumble!

21
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,830
Eat this!

22
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,410
I can't let my teammates get hurt again.

23
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,750
What should I do?

24
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,789
My mind is overloading!

All Might.

39
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,290
We should observe for now.

40
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,620
Aizawa, what are you saying?

41
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,750
The fifth battle

42
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,290
should continue as usual.

43
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,750
"VLAD KING, QUIRK: BLOOD CONTROL"
Continue?

44
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,829
No matter how you see it,
Midoriya was acting very strange.

45
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,450
If it happens again, I will put a stop to him.

46
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,410
Shinso managed to stop him
with brainwashing.

47
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:01,620
If it's still part of Midoriya's Quirk,
I can stop it.

48
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,080
Aizawa, why?

49
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,620
They want to continue the battle.

50
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,500
Both Midoriya...

51
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,120
and Shinso.

52
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,870
No, not just the two of them.

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,079
All of them desire...

54
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,250
to win this battle.

55
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,700
You are surprisingly optimistic.

56
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,620
You're right.

60
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,500
I can't use my Quirk right now.

61
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,909
I might put everyone else in danger.

62
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,830
We should retreat and regroup.

63
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:51,159
If we fall back, we lose.

64
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:54,159
Shinso is right before us.

"HITOSHI SHINSO, QUIRK: BRAINWASH"
This is our chance to win!

But...

67
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,040
Wouldn't that mean you have to fight

68
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,290
without using your Quirk?

69
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,040
No.

70
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,370

74
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,540
We can't keep taking damages.

The ball can stick to any surface,
but only I can bounce them off!

80
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,500
The balls I laid down are
traps for everyone else,

81
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,620
but they are platforms for me!

82
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,000
I calculated everything.

83
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,620
I knew I couldn't withstand Twin Impact's power.

84
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,290
I knew this would happen too!

85
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,950
Stop messing around!

But he is moving too quickly!

We have no chance to devise a counter-attack!

94
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,330
That's right.

95
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,540
Mineta and the others are doing well!

96
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,160
Ashido can be in range if they close in!

"KYOKA JIRO, QUIRK: EARPHONE JACK"
Should the teachers stop them?

"NEITO MONOMA, QUIRK: COPY"
You can't become stronger on your own.

104
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,580
I can only copy others' Quirks.

105
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,409
I don't have the qualities
to be in the spotlight.

106
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:56,040
But I never hated my Quirk.

107
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,290
Every masterpiece has a side character

108
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:03,040
that can outshine the main protagonist!

109
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,290
Your power...

110
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,160
Could it be...

111
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,290
I'm taking it!

112
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,540
Is he copying One For All?

113
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,120
A weak body can't handle the sheer might.

114
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,290
The body will explode into a million pieces.

115
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,080
No, Monoma! Don't do it!

116
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,040
You're too late!

00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,410
It's not your Quirk! He was tricking you!

119
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,500
Run!

120
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,159
I couldn't activate it.

121
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,870
Curse it, it was a bluff!

122
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,870
Monoma!

123
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,790
Release.

124
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,409
This is my first fight with
you after the sports day!

125
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:50,330
Isn't that right, Midoriya?

126
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:55,540
If Shinso gets away, the enemy
will have the upper hand later on.

127
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,750
You're a great threat, Shinso!

128
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,120
Eraser Head, Midoriya is on the move.

129
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,540
I'm watching him.

130
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,830
That hurts...

131
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,250
If Eraser Head used six years to master it,

132
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,950
can I really use it at will?

133
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,950
I had to learn from scratch on my own.

134
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,080
Having the tips makes a huge difference.

135
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,620
People like you and me,

136
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:32,620
if we can't defend ourselves during
critical moments, we'll die for sure.

137
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,039
Practice as I say.

138
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,289
I am not...

139
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:39,450
going to waste my time on useless matters.

140
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:47,370
I'm different now.

141
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,750
I should use the binding cloth sooner.

142
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,000
Sorry...

143
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,410
I must become a real hero with my own strength.

144
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,450
Midoriya!

145
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,000
He is different from earlier.

146
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,540
My doubts and insecurities are gone.

147
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,750
What's important is to control your heart.

148
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:21,540
His aura and voice...

149
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:26,160
He shared so many resemblances with All Might.

150
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,910
Control your heart.

151
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,910
Use our power as your own extension!

You can become a hero.

All Might said that to me.

My training with him at the bay park...

166
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,290
My starting line...

167
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,620
Just remembering these...Whenever it is,

168
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,870
I feel invincible.

169
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,000
Wait.

170
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,500
Why?

171
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,700
He seems different now.

172
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:41,700
He relies on Young Uraraka's Quirk
to focus on his own power.

173
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:46,120
What happened in the last few minutes?

174
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,750
Young Midoriya...

175
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,040
Come on, what was it just now?

176
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,160
Was your rampage just an act?

177
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,870
You've disrespected my spirit!

178
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,080
It's gone.

179
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,000
That power...

180
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,250
It disappeared in an instant.

181
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,870
It's a pain that comes from within.

182
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:20,870
Due to the accumulated power by One For All,

183
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:24,410
this Quirk has become much stronger
than when I wielded it.

184
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:28,120
The new power is too much
for my body to withstand.

185
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,200
This isn't the power I can control
with 20% of my max output.

186
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,000
I can feel it deeply.

187
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,250
This power exists before One For All.

188
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:44,200
It's a power I can only master after
having total control over One For All.

189
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,830
But even so, using inaccurate air blasts
might trigger another rampage.

190
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:54,250
If I use One For All at 8%...

191
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:00,500
Under these circumstances,
Midoriya won't be brainwashed.

192
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,040
Sorry, Monoma.

193
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,120
Don't you resent Midoriya?

194
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,830
If we show the slightest mistake,
we'll fall like the last team

195
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,660
after he breaks through our formation.

196
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,830
So we should deal with Midoriya first.

197
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:20,040
Either the way, we have no chance
unless we can take him out.

198
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,160
We're counting on you, Shinso.

199
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,000
I wasted the opening you created for me.

200
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,370
But I won't let this be game over for us!

201
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,290
It seems like the Poltergeist missed.

202
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,410
It's been around five minutes
since the battle started.

203
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,660
Monoma can only copy a Quirk for five minutes.

204
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,040
Maybe my Quirk can last for ten minutes.

205
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,200
If I attack now, can you beat me on your own?

206
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,370
Oh my, you thought of everything.

207
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,910
She is wary of Shinso's Quirk.

208
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,500
Do you know how many Quirks
I can copy at a time?

209
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:10,700
I can confirm he copied Yanagi's Poltergeist
and Kodai's Size.

210
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,450
Finally, he will need Shinso's Brainwash
to execute their plan.

211
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,660
Three Quirks at a time?

212
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,540
Is it because I have three timers on me?

213
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,950
If I pretended to only copy three Quirks,

214
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:24,250
what would you do if I started using
a fourth Quirk?

215
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,290
I can copy different Quirks.

216
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:32,750
I can't activate them all at once,
but there are residue power I can use.

217
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:37,250
Except for power that affects the body,
most Quirk effects can last.

218
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,160
Such as Kodai's Size.

219
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:46,080
Even after activating other Quirks
after I enlarged the bolt, its size remains.

220
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,700
Do you not get what I mean?

221
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,450
This is the "fire".

222
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,500
This is the last struggle of a side character.

223
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,290
What did Monoma do to Deku?

224
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,290
But...

225
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,250
Uraraka, I need a favor from you.

226
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,080
I need you to make me weightless.

227
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,580
I'll close in on Shinso.

228
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,410
I leave Monoma to you.

229
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:19,080
Afterward, regroup with Ashido and Mineta.

230
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,000
Don't worry about me.

231
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,620
I can't win him in direct combat.

232
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,870
Then I must lure him into my field!

233
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,040
He's too fast! He's catching up!

234
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,580
Fire.

235
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,700
Twin Impact.

236
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:54,040
It creates a second impact on
the point of impact.

237
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:59,080
Shinso, I apologize for getting caught so soon.

238
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,620
Did I manage to create an opening?

239
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,830
Monoma...

240
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,410
Could it be...

241
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,580
He used Shoda's Quirk at that instant!

242
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,790
And they say I have a dexterous physique.

243
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,870
Things should be easier after we took
one of them down!

244
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,120
"EIJIRO KIRISHIMA, QUIRK: HARDENING"
It's not looking good for Ashido.

245
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,120
"TOGARU KAMAKIRI, QUIRK: RAZOR SHARP"
Good job, Shoda!

246
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,330
You can turn the battle around!

247
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,620
Remember...

248
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,290
Remember the starting line...

249
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,870
at all time!

250
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,330
Reiko!

251
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,620
Kodai! Yanagi!

252
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,580
Don't worry about me.

253
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,790
Don't worry.

254
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,830
We can win!

255
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,580
Curse it.

256
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,370
I've been looking forward to this fight.

257
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,000
I want to show you how strong I've become.

258
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:25,580
But everyone has moved forward.

259
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,000
They never stop moving forward.

260
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
They go beyond!

261
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,160
Plus Ultra?

262
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,790
Curse it.

263
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,700
The Hero Course is amazing.

264
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,660
WELCOME

265
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:53,950
There was come close calls during the battle.
But the fifth battle is over.

266
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,870
The match is over.

267
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:00,620
"MIDNIGHT, QUIRK: SOMNAMBULIST"
All of you managed to anticipate enemy attacks.

268
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,540
"THE BIAS BROADCAST IS STILL VERY APPARENT"
You performed well.

269
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,079
"WE WANT VLAD KING REMOVED FROM BROADCASTING"
We'll announce the result now.

270
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,829
Class A won the first battle.

271
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,619
Class B won the second battle.

272
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:11,660
The third battle ended in a tie.

273
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,700
Class A won the fourth battle.

274
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,160
Class A also won the fifth battle.

275
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,540
The victor of this joint training...

276
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,579
is Class 1-A!

277
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:27,410
I wasn't really that competitive.

278
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:30,290
"KINOKO KOMORI, QUIRK: MUSHROOM"
I know, but this feels bad.

279
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,750
"IBARA SHIOZAKI, QUIRK: VINES"
Almost everyone was very tactful in battles.

280
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,660
Sir.

281
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,700
I can't achieve anything on my own.

282
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,660
I still have a long way to go.

283
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,200
This joint training also serves
as my entrance test, right?

284
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,080
You knew all along?

285
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,080
Did you tell him?

286
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,250
No.

287
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:56,870
But I could tell based on
the timing and form of this training.

288
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:00,660
The lack of communication devices
makes it easier to test my skill.

289
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,040
Not to mention only I joined both teams.

290
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,830
Either the way, we still have a post mortem.

291
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,500
You should get ready.

292
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,620
The post mortem starts now.

293
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:17,250
First of all, Midoriya,

294
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,040
what happened to you just now?

295
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,540
FUMIKAGE TOKOYAMI, QUIRK: DARK SHADOW
You showed some dark manifestation.

296
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,750
"SHIHAI KUROIRO, QUIRK: DARK"
You lost control, but the manoeuvre was...

297
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,750
Was it a new move?

298
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,160
That was way beyond the limit of raw strength.

299
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,830
Honestly,

300
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,620
I still don't quite understand what it was.

301
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,700
The power was surging,
and I couldn't control it.

302
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,120
It was as though the very thing I trusted
had backfired at me.

303
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:50,950
I was terrified too.

304
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,500
But Uraraka and Shinso stopped my rampage.

305
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,790
That helped me realize it wasn't as I thought.

306
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,120
If Shinso hadn't brainwashed me,

307
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,540
things would have become worse.

308
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,620
Shinso, you asked whether it was a trick or not.

309
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,750
But at that moment, I had no idea either.

310
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,580
Thank you, both of you.

311
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,950
I only said that because
I wanted to brainwash him.

312
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,910
But he's still concerned about it.

313
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,950
It was clear to everyone you weren't acting.

314
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,250
Indeed!

315
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,200
Shinso was amazing when Midoriya lost control.

316
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,950
Uraraka deserves praise for her quick
reflexes and reaction!

317
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,700
She risked her life to calm down her friend!

318
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,790
Yes, that's the way to do it! I like it!

319
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,750
Uraraka, you flew to him a swoosh!

320
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,870
You were so fast!

321
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:47,830
You hugged him with your arms.

322
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:56,950
I charged out without thinking too much.
I should have reacted with more cautions.

323
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:01,910
But it's better than doing nothing
and end up with regrets afterward.

324
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,450
I want to...

325
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,370
save the people.

326
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,160
You are showing great improvement, Uraraka.

327
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:20,000
I didn't use my Quirk for Midoriya alone.

328
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,620
I merely followed Uraraka's instruction.

329
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,160
More precisely speaking,

330
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,790
I saw those black whips
attacking Monoma and the others.

331
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:32,120
In any case, our chances of winning would
dwindle unless we could subdue the rampage.

332
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,870
I only stopped Midoriya because
I wanted to fight and beat him.

333
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,040
What happened back then was
merely a coincidence.

334
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,660
I could barely handle all that was going on...

335
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,950
No one asked you to go out
of your way to do such a thing.

336
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,450
Everyone here

337
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:58,700
is training hard to become a hero
that saves lives from danger.

338
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:04,250
Only a genius like All Might can
catch up so quickly to all of them.

339
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:10,410
You can't save anyone if you're obsessed
with what people think of you.

340
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:15,660
If you can't save yourself,
you don't have the strength to save others.

341
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,700
On this point alone, your performance just now

342
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,000
was enough to pass the test.

343
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,540
But I still have much to learn.

344
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,290
One thing I've learned after real combat...

345
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,700
is how amazing the Hero Course can be.

346
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,120
I will not be satisfied
with just passing the test.

347
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:39,200
I will work even harder
to achieve greater heights!

348
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,700
That's good to know.

349
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:46,160
Fight on with your Plus Ultra spirit.

350
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,330

Next episode!

371
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:26,870
One For All's new power has awakened.

372
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:29,950
That power is the Quirk of the previous wielder.

373
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,410
That mysterious man told me

374
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:36,250
there would be six other Quirks
manifesting inside of me.

375
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,700
Wouldn't be similar to All For One's power?

376
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,040
Next episode, The New Power And All For One.

377
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,370
Control your heart,

378
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:46,830
wield One For All like your own extension!

379
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,000
Go Beyond!

380
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,950
