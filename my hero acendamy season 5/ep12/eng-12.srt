The Hero Course of U.A. High

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:09,000
held a joint training between
Class A and Class B.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,040
Class A won the match with
three victories and one draw.

4
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:19,910
CLASS A WON

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,000
I still have a long way to go.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,500
I've seen how strong the Hero Course is.

7
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,580
I won't be satisfied with just passing the test.

8
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:40,080
I will work harder and push myself
to reach greater heights.

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,620
Good.

Shinso, in the end you were trying

23
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:30,200
to cause disruption and shift the battle
to your advantage, right?

24
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,290
You were quick to block my way
with those pipes.

25
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,540
You were moving like Mr. Aizawa
with your binding cloth.

26
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,700
In the first battle,

27
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,370
I thought the team's coordination
enabled you to unleash your potential.

28
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,120
But that wasn't the case.

29
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,750
Shinso's mobility and reactions were impeccable.

30
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:54,000
You were on par with those from the Hero Course.
You had me nervous for a moment.

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,660
You're much better at using your strength
for others than I ever was.

32
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,580
"SHOTA AIZAWA, QUIRK: ERASURE"
Indeed.

33
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,540
"VLAD KING, QUIRK: BLOOD CONTROL"
We will make another assessment.

34
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,160
But it's likely...No, it's almost certain

35
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,580
that Shinso will join the Hero Course
in his second year.

36
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,080
Don't you let him overtake you!

37
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,579
Yes!

38

"DENKI KAMINARI, QUIRK: ELECTRIFICATION"
Sir, which class will he be joining?

39
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,750
Class A?

40
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,829
Class B?

41
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:23,540
We'll decide when the time comes.
It's too early to be certain.

42
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,290
Sir!

43
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,329
Mineta's actions were so low!
Please punish him now.

44
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,700
It was nothing but a lucky coincidence.

45
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,160
Not to mentioned I was giving my all
to deal with Shota and his teammates.

46
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:43,579
It's undeniable that Class B lost.

47
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:44,620
However,

48
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,500
we didn't lose to you when it came down
to the marvel we displayed!

49
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,540
Had I known Midoriya's Quirk
wasn't compatible with mine,

50
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,700
I would have come up
with a strategy against that!

51
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,160
Which means,

52
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,120
"NEITO MONOMA, QUIRK: COPY"
the outcome might be different if fought again!

53
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,080
That's not going to happen.
The lesson ends now!

54
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,410
Speaking of which,

55
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:05,370
Monoma activated Shota's Quirk on me,

56
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,250
so we must have made physical contact.

57
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:14,160
So One For All was copied too.

58
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,329
About my Quirk, the One For All,

59
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:23,000
it condenses multiple physical abilities
that are honed to their limits into one.

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,750
A half-baked body won't be able to take it.

61
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,500
Your limbs will explode into a million pieces!

62
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,790
That was what made me worried.

63
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,450
Had I known Midoriya's Quirk
wasn't compatible with mine...

64
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,870
What does he mean by compatible?

65
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,580
Excuse me, but I have some questions.

66
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,950
Monoma, come to Eri's place tomorrow.

67
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:49,330
They are visiting Eri tomorrow...

68

"MILIO TOGATA, QUIRK: PERMEATION"

Yes. I want to write a letter.

70
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,870
A letter? For whom?

71
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,660
For Lemillion and Deku.

72
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,410
I don't know what I should say
so I want to write them down in a letter.

73
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,410
I want to thank you.

THE NEW POWER AND ONE FOR ALL

75
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,330
What's wrong with you?

76
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,660
Are you scared, you jerk?

77
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,660
I told you to wait!

78
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,950
Hold on! It's not coming out!

79
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,000
Stop!

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,290
It's not what you think it is!
Cool it down!

KATSUKI BAKUGO, QUIRK: EXPLOSION

82
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,950
His new power came out when he was in danger!

83
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,250
No. We are training to keep it in.

84
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,700
Young Midoriya, how do you feel?

85
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,330
It's not coming out.

86
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,450
I can no longer sense it.

87
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:59,870
A Quirk from the preview wielder...

88
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,540
Is this what One For All has developed into?

89
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,700
Do you always chitchat in this place?

90
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,040
I was surprised when you came here.

91
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,200
After all, Bakugo is also
keeping this a secret for us.

92
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,950
All Might, do you know what happened?

93
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,250
About those black tentacles?

94
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,120
I was seeing those for the first time too.

95
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,660
A bald wielder in the past...

96
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:30,250
The wielder before my master
was a young man with dark hair.

97
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,790
One For All holds the powers of
all its previous wielders...

98
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,750
Perhaps even my master didn't know it.

99
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,040
So you're the first to have it all, trash.

100
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,159
Don't call him trash.

101
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:44,540
Was there anything that triggered it?

102
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,659
Nothing at all.

103
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:49,830
The bald guy told me the time has come.

104
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:53,909
There might be other external trigger points.

105
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:57,040
Could it have anything to do with All For One?

106
00:06:57,909 --> 00:07:02,750
After all, that guy gave birth
to the Quirk of One For All.

107
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,950
Having multiple Quirks at once.

108
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:09,450
I see. It's the same as his power.

109
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,750
You just said what I hated to admit the most.

110
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,000
In any case, to prevent Midoriya
from becoming him,

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,950
we need to know more about this new power.

112
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,870
You lack danger awareness!

113
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,870
If I keep crushing you,
it will come out for sure!

114
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:31,250
So if I crushed you while
the tentacles are out...

115
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,620
Please tone down your motivation.

116
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,040
If One For All is answering to my thoughts,

117
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,080
then at that moment...

118
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,620
This power...

119
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,000
exists before my power.

120
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,700
I decided it was a power I couldn't master
at the moment.

121
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,250
Perhaps that's why the Quirk seemed
to be sealed away.

122
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,330
In that case, I should try to imagine it
as locking and unlocking a door.

123
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,950
I must first learn how to
unleash those tentacles.

124
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,910
This is too boring, jerk!

125
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,290
It's pointless if you can't use it!

126
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,540
I'm out of here.

127
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,580
Your nagging is getting on my nerve!

128
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,790
I think that's all for today.

129
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,120
Yes.

130
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,620
A power of All For One...

131
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,790
You fool!

132
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,620
"TETSUTETSU TETSUTETSU, QUIRK: STEEL"
You fool! How can you be so discouraged?

133
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,950
"EIJIRO KIRISHIMA, QUIRK: HARDENING"
But my performance today

134
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,200
was nowhere as remarkable as yours.

135
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,289
I could withstand the heat because
my body is made out of metal.

136
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:41,539
And because it's metal,
there is a limit to its hardness.

137
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:45,450
Unlike you, I can't get
denser after taking a beating!

138
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,700
You and I,

139
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,580
we each have our own uniqueness!

140
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,450

"TENYA IDA, QUIRK: ENGINE"
We have beef stew for dinner tonight.

142

That's great!

143
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,370
Class B is here too.

144
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,290
Some of them are here for
post mortem and exchange thoughts.

145
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
Midoriya, I've been looking for you.

146
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,080
"SHOTO TODOROKI, QUIRK: HALF COLD HALF HOT"
Todoroki.

147
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,950
Do you have two different Quirks too?

148
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,080
On the sports day...

149
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,160
Show me your best!

150
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,290
You looked very earnest back then.
So if you were hiding a Quirk from us,

151
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,080
it would be shocking to me.

152
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,830
No!

153
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,370
How should I put it?
I think it's an extension of my Quirk.

154
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:37,160
I think they are still the same thing at core.

155
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,750
I was terrified when it happened
for the first time.

156
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,750
I see, it must have been hard for you.

157
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,660
I apologize for ever doubting you.

158

What happened today was too shocking.

00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,910
That sharp and dim-witted fool.

160
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,410
You did well too, Todoroki.

161
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:57,040
You already have so much
control over your flame.

162
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,370
No, I still have much to learn.
I was just as surprised as you were.

163
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,950
Which is why...

164
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:08,200
I must work to improve myself.

165
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,790
-WE NEED TO TALK, PLEASE REPLY.
-THERE IS SOMETHING I WANT TO ASK

166
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,410
I can't believe it.

167
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,580
ENDEAVOR, QUIRK: HELLFLAME
You actually came to me.

168
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,910
Well, that settled it.

169
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:34,290
I can handle the related paperwork.

170
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,330
You should focus on the teaching.

171
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,080
I appreciate your help.

172
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,160
"PRESENT MIC, QUIRK: VOICE"
Shinso is very much like your younger self.

173
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,540
Do you see yourself in him, Aizawa?

174
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,580
Or perhaps you saw...

175
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,250
Just get to the point.

176
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,450
I still have work to take care of.

177
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,910
It's nothing, just chitchat.

178
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:06,250
The dark side of U.A. High...

179
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,910
What is this kid talking about?

180
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,950
I told her during the school festival

181
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,160
"DARK SIDE OF U.A. HIGH"
that you were the dark side of U.A. High.

182
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,620
I'm a man who walks the path of righteousness!

183
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:22,120
What are we doing here exactly?

184
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,950
Midoriya, Togata.

185
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,700
I'm sorry to ask you here.

186
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,080
But I need a favor from Monoma.

187
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,500
It's frustrating because Eri and Monoma
don't have much in common in their personality.

188
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,410
What do you take me for?

189
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,700
Well, Monoma?

190
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,620
It's a feint.

191
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,870
I'm sorry but the result
is disappointing, Eraser Head.

192
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,950
I see. What a shame.

193
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,450
He copied Eri's Quirk.

194
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,040
But for what purpose?

195
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,040
Monoma, what do you mean it's a feint?

196
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,290
Both of your Quirks are of the same type.

197
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:10,540
Your Quirk is the accumulation type.

198
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,040
My Quirk allows me to copy
the fundamental quality of other Quirks.

199
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,500
But if the Quirk stores energy to be unleashed,

200
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,700
I can't copy the energy that
has already been stored.

201
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,500
I see.

202
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,330
Fat Gum's Quirk allows
him to store energy from fat.

203
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:32,040
If Monoma copies the Quirk,
his body will still be as weak.

204
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,370
This kind of things happen.

205
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,200
I copied your Quirk but I couldn't use it...

206
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,000
because of this principle.

207
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,620
Had it worked the other way,
I would have caused Monoma to explode!

208
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,000
But why is he copying Eri's Quirk?

209
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,660
Even if we let Eri activate her Quirk again,

210
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:56,370
the same disastrous incident will happen
unless we know how to control it.

211
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:00,660
So I thought I could ask Monoma to copy
her Quirk and show her how to use it.

212
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,040
It would have made her life much easier.

213
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,200
But I don't think that's possible now.

214
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,200
Sorry.

215
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,410
I am always causing you trouble.

216
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,450
My power will only make everyone worry.

217
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:19,620
I wish I could get rid of this power.

218
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,080
Eri...

219
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,250
It doesn't just make people worry.

220
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,200
Remember, you once saved my life!

221
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,620
What matters is how you use it.

222
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,200
Take a kitchen knife as an example.

223
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,910
The knife can be dangerous,

224
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,160
but a sharper knife makes it easier
to make delicious cuisines.

225
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,450
Your power is amazing.

226
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,500
After all,

227
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,040
that guy gave birth to
the Quirk of One For All.

228
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,500
That is true,

229
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,040
but this power will become my comrade.

230
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,790
I will try my best.

231
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:11,790
I must master the power of One For All
and make it my own extension.

give up the money?

00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,370
A carnival of ice and snow!

318
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,540
Lady, please stay away from there!

319
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,700
Go somewhere else if you want to end your life!

320
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,540
This is my most powerful attack!

321
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:18,120
It could get a little ugly, but I guess
there is no other way.

322
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,870
Flashfreeze Heatwave!

323
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,790
With heat,

324
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,700
carbon dioxide will evaporate.

325
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,450
Curse you, that move just now...

326
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,870
I controlled the output.

327
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:53,790
Are you hurt?

328
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,950
No way, jerk. Are you looking down on me?

329
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,200
What about that girl?

330
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,040
She's fine, jerk!

331
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,250
Are you two all right?

332
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,370
You must be students from U.A. High.

333
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,500
Mind your words!

334
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:12,290
You two took care of these villains?

335
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,120
They robbed those on the street
of their wallets and belongings.

336
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,620
We confirmed the enemy's number
and apprehended them.

337
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,370
And the things they took?

338
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,200
I gathered everything
before they were burned.

339
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,700
A flawless execution!

340
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,870
This is amazing! I can't believe
you're still students!

341
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,580
Thank you so much!

342
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,830
You'll become outstanding heroes in the future!

343
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:38,330
Leave the cleaning up to me, Slidin' Go!

344
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,750
His gauntlet exploded.

345
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,700
Indeed.

346
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,290
It must be some half-baked good
from the black market.

347
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,040
You two did well.

348
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,370
Thank you.

349
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,950
All right, let's go back.

350
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,450
You must be starving.

351
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,950
I have to melt the ice first.

352
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,790
I'm not going to help you.

Has everyone gone out?

374
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,080
Congratulations...

375
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,370
on getting your provisional license!

376
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,620
Have some cake!

377
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,080
No one can eat that much!

378
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,290
Todoroki!

379
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,540
Congratulations!

380
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,120
Nice job, Bakugo!

381
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,160
Kacchan, we can no go
on hero activities together!

382
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,700
Don't act so high and mighty, stupid nerd!

383
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,500
That's not what I meant!

384
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,870
Don't argue with me!

385
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,000
Next episode.

386
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,500
Kacchan and Todoroki
got their provisional license.

387
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,200
All of Class A can now take part
in hero activities.

388
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,290
The second semester ends on December 25.

389
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:36,830
Let's throw a Christmas party!

390
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:39,580
Next episode, Merry Christmas!

391
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,500
But we wouldn't know

392
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,790
that darkness is brewing while
we celebrate in joy.

393
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,000
Go beyond!

394
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Plus Ultra!
