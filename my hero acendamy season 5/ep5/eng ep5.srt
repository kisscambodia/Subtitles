are in a joint training battle.

In the first battle,

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,500
Shinso's Quirk successfully disrupted
the coordination of Class B.

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,250
The battle ended with Class A victorious.

"SHOTA AIZAWA, QUIRK: ERASURE"
What have you learned from the first battle?

19
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,750
If the opponents are avoiding a fight with me,

20
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,450
my Quirk is basically useless in the battle.

21
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,200
If that were a real battle with villains,

22
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,040
Shiozaki would have

23
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,540
"EIJIRO KIRISHIMA, QUIRK: HARDENING"
finished me off instantly.

24
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,500
"KOJI KODA, QUIRK: ANIVOICE"
I must learn how to order the insects

00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,790
with greater precision.

26
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,250
"DENKI KAMINARI, QUIRK: ELECTRIFICATION"
I did a great job, didn't I?

27
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,500
I bet you are all awestruck, but that's OK!

28
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,000
I know it's hard to control the urge
to fall in love with me.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,829
No sweat!

30
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:32,750
"TSUYU ASUI, QUIRK: FROG"
I lost Koda and Kirishima...

31
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,950
when the battle began.

32
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,700
I wanted to win without losing any teammates.

33
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,079
But I messed up so badly.

34
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,079
The binding cloth.

35
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,200
Kero?

36
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,700
I failed to put the tool Mr. Aizawa gave me
to good use.

37
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,500
"HITOSHI SHINSO, QUIRK: BRAINWASH"
That was unacceptable.

38
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,040
It wouldn't be so challenging
if it were easy to use.

39
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,579
It took me six years to
finally master this tool.

40
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:55,120
Don't be sorry, just be better.

41
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:57,870
Yes.

42
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,410
"YUGA AOYAMA, QUIRK: NAVAL LASER"
The two who went to internship...

43
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,330
is very strict with themselves.

44
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,450
"HANTA SERO, QUIRK: TAPE"
That is only natural.

45
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,200
Shie Hasaikai, wasn't it?

46
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,120
I heard it was an impossible battle to win.

47
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,580
They actually pulled through that fight.

48
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,330
Even if this is only a training battle,

49
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,700
their attitude and motivation
are undoubtedly different.

50
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,540
Compared to that...

51
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,040
Jammingway's outstanding performance
was a genuine surprise.

52
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,870
Listen up!

53
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,450
Kirishima, you must learn how to bait
your opponent into battling you head-on.

54
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,329
Yes.

55
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:32,200
Koda, it's as you said earlier,

56
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,870
you need more precision
in controlling the animals.

57
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,200
Aside from a direct attack,
you must learn to take them by surprise.

58
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,040
Kaminari, you got too complacent at first!

59
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,910
Does this mean you can't do well
unless you lose your teammates?

60
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh...

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,079
Asui.

62
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:49,870
Remember not to dwell on mistakes.
Instead, learn to recover from it quickly.

63
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,040
Kero!

64
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,950
Reflect on your mistake and utilize the lesson
for future training.

65
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:54,829
That's all!

66
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:56,290
Yes!

67
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:11,040
They won, but came to realize
their lack of experience.

68
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,160
But they are not disheartened.

69
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,370
They are already

70
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,040
figuring out ways to improve for
the upcoming battles.

71
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,540
"MIDNIGHT, QUIRK: SOMNAMBULIST"
This is inspiring!

72
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,950
Shinso's freshness is awesome!

73
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,580
"ALL MIGHT, QUIRK: ONE FOR ALL"
Hey, you...

74
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,370
VLAD KING, QUIRK: BLOOD CONTROL

75
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,660
I'm pretty sure you are well aware of...

76
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,830
why you failed.

77
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,580
"JUROTA SHISHIDA, QUIRK: BEAST"
Whether you played to Shishida's strength,

78
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,409
"IBARA SHIOZAKI, QUIRK: VINES"
or played to Shiozaki's strength,

79
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:40,870
had you coordinated better,
you would have won easily!

80
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,370
Your glare is scaring us, Vlad King.

81
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,620
"NEITO MONOMA, QUIRK: COPY"
Shiozaki is too honest,

82
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,659
Shishida, expecting her to lie was you failed.

83
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:51,330
Monoma...

84
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,330
It's true we allowed the opponents
too much time to get ready.

85
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,500
Sorry, Shiozaki.

86
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,250
May the inferno incinerate you.

87
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,580
However,

88
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,790
that was a great battle you put on.

89
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,120
I couldn't wait to fight by his side.

90
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,870
Hey, Shinso!

91
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,750
Let's compose a strategy that will
annihilate Class A and their pride!

92
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,200
We'll make them shut up for good!

93
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,790
"MINORU MINETA, QUIRK: POP OFF"
We'll instill despair into all of their hearts!

94
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,830
-He is so excited by himself.
-They will kneel before Class B and surrender!

95
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,120
We should come up with a strategy too.

96
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,950
Let's list out the ideas and tactics we have.

97
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,700
OK.

98
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,160
Let's design a combo, like an ultimate move!

99
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,290
We should brainstorm together.

100
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,330
Todoroki should be our main offensive strength.

101
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,200
Me?

102
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,450
That's a sound plan.

103
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,700
Bakugo, we should discuss our strategy as well.

104
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,540
"KATSUKI BAKUGO, QUIRK: EXPLOSION"
You! Don't you dare slow me down!

105
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,750
He's loud as ever.

106
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,540
"OCHACCO URARAKA, QUIRK: ZERO GRAVITY"
We'll face Shinso in the fifth battle.

107
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,580
"MINA ASHIDO, QUIRK: ACID"
His voice is a threat to us all.

108
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,330
Sticky Acid Flying Kick!

109
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,000
What kind of ultimate move is that?

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,370
The field is full of obstacles,
making it easy to hide.

111
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,159
Which means I can search more easily.

112
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,250
You can count on me.

113
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,450
I'll come up with the plan!

114
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,200
I'll come up with a plan for my fight!

115
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,410
"MASHIRAO OJIRO, QUIRK: TAIL"
Ida can be our trump card during an emergency.

116
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,410
"TENYA IDA, QUIRK: ENGINE"
But before that,

117
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,540
I must tell you about my Recipro moves.

118
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,290
Instant Kill Swimming Orb!

119
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,040
What kind of an attack is that?

120
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,410
-I'll inject my acid into your grape!
-Injured combatants, proceed to the infirmary.

121
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,370
-Then we'll toss it at them!
-Puny humans can't change their damaged parts.

122
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,870
As if!

123
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,750
This is it!

124
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,410
The younglings' spring of freshness!

125
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,790
But it's winter right now.

126
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,330
It's already the end of the year.

127
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:32,330
Everyone is doing their best to develop
their Quirks and ultimate moves.

128
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,909
Young Midoriya has learned the ways
to use One For All.

129
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:41,250
He can use Shoot Style and Air Force
for his attacks.

130
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,250
He's earned his provisional license,

131
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,409
he's battled the villains of Shie Hasaikai.

132
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,290
And the school festival as well.

133
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:59,870
With every event and obstacle
that came to pass, he grows stronger.

134
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,080
This is his chance to test
his strength against others'.

135
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,080
He will learn what his place is
as of now.

136
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,660
This training will serve as a lesson
that cover all aspects.

137
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,790
All Might.

138
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,620
How as Shinso's performance?

139
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,750
Not bad.

140
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,450
He doesn't falter at all.

141
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,540
The fact it's hard for him
to accept his defeat deserves a compliment.

142
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:32,870
This is the entrance exam for him
to transfer to Hero Course.

143
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,040
I believe he will give his best
for the next battle.

144
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,580
Vlad, commence the next battle.

145
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,950
Well...

146
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:46,080
Second battle,

147
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,950
get ready!

148
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:50,000
2ND BATTLE

OPERATION NEW IMPROVED MOVES!

150
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,500
Yaoyorozu.

151
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,200
What is it, Kendo?

152
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,290
Why didn't you join the pageant contest
during the school festival?

153
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,290
I thought you would join for sure.

154
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,410
"MOMO YAOYOROZU, QUIRK: CREATION"
That was because Mr. Aizawa...

155
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:11,000
didn't tell me about the contest.

156
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,950
We were too busy practicing
our band performance too.

157
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:19,330
Perhaps Mr. Aizawa didn't
think I needed to participate.

158
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,450
ITSUKA KENDO, QUIRK: BIG FIST

159
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,620
After we filmed the advertisement
during that workplace training,

160
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,660
we've always been seen as a pair.

161
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,500
This must be the "pair pushing".

162
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,250
Pair pushing?

163
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,950
Pair pushing means

164
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,950
everyone likes it no matter what.

165
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,659
"TORU HAGAKURE, QUIRK: INVISIBILITY"
During the school festival,

166
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:45,080
people kept saying your names together.
"Yaoyorozu-Kendo!"

167
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,750
That did happen.

168
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,000
Idol worshiping.

169
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,790
How should I put it?

170
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:56,620
Yaoyorozu has the better Quirk and grades.
But people are comparing me with her.

171
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,950
That really gets on my nerve.

172
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,290
I've personally been looking forward
to fight you.

173
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,000
I humbly...

174
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,540
accept your challenge.

175
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,000
Tokoyami.

176
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,580
You and I...

177
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,790
are the same.

178
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,080
Shihai Kuroiro.

179
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,200
Your Quirk is Darkness,

180
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,750
you can move freely in dark objects, am I right?

181
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:28,500
Our rivalry is destined.

182
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,950
I see. You can read the abyss as well.

183
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,200
Stay in eternal darkness.

184
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,500
They really don't shine at all.

185
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,120
Both teams are ready.

186
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,540
Well then...

187
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,160
All the best, Team Kendo!

188
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,160
Second battle, start!

189
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,120
"WE'RE AGAINST THE BIAS BROADCAST!"
Please stop this bias broadcast!

190
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,790
Stop it!

191
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,250
Very well, let's go!

192
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,620
Yeah!

193
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,950
What is Kendo's role in Class B?

194
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,700
Kendo is amazing!

195
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,330
You're speaking too loud!

196
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,620
"TETSUTETSU TETSUTETSU, QUIRK: STEEL"
After all, she is our class rep!

197
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,200
Her mind works fast and she keeps calm
when she makes judgments!

198
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,790
She has the courage to step forward
when time calls for it!

199
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,160
Her cheerful demeanor brings our class together!

200
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,080
Without her,

201
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,250
the entire Class B would have
sided with Monoma!

202
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,830
Hey, don't say that so loudly.

203
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,290
The Big Sis of Class B!

204
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,750
That's right, it's Itsuka Kendo!

205
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,120
Can Yaoyorozu's operation...

206
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,040
"SHOTO TODOROKI, QUIRK: HALF COLD HALF HOT"
be executed successfully in this battle?

207
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,200
What operation?

208
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:38,040
Please scout ahead for us,

209
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,200
Tokoyami.

210
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,160
Roger.

211
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,200
Dark Shadow.

212
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,660
Yeah!

213
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,410
Report back as soon as you spot the enemies.

214
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,750
Leave it to me!

215
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,450
I basically know all about their Quirks.

216
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:58,450
But I have no idea what new moves
they have come up with.

217
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,870
That might lead to our defeat.

218
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,500
Which is why...

219
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,620
we'll have to see how it goes first.

220
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,450
Dark Shadow seems to have found our enemies.

221
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,250
It's right under that chimney.

222
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,660
Let's head over there.

223
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,370
You're going to see anything!

224
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:22,160
I'll deal with the weak ones first!

225
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,410
I'm counting on you,

226
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,540
Kuroiro!

227
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,200
I'll be right back.

228
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,290
Dark Shadow went really far.

229
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,250
Did you level up during your internship?

230
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,660
That's hard to tell.

231
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,120
The further Dark Shadow goes,
the harder it is to maintain its form.

232
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,330
He's back.

233
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,580
Everyone, scatter!

234
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,250
Tokoyami!

235
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,080
What is going on?

236
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,830
Fumikage!

237
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:01,250
We fell for their trap!

238
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,120
What's going on with Dark Shadow?

239
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,250
Did it go berserk?

240
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,540
No.

241
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,290
The field is bright enough for Tokoyami
to keep Dark Shadow under control.

242
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:14,160
Is something else controlling Dark Shadow?

243
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,450
It's must the Quirk's of someone from Class B!

244
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,580
Wait!

245
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,790
Hagakure, release your beam!

246
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,040
Yes!

247
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,700
Warp Refraction!

248
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,700
Say "Cheese!"

249
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,750
Return, Dark Shadow!

250
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:42,870
Kuroiro came out from Dark Shadow!

251
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,830
He disappeared!

252
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,250
He merged with the shadow.

253
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,370
That's Kuroiro's Quirk.

254
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,450
Class B, Shihai Kuroiro.

255
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,080
Quirk: Darkness.

256
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,080
He can merge with darkness,

257
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,870
and even move the object upon possession,

258
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,450
but only if the object is movable.

259
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,750
Fumikage Tokoyami.

260
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,830
I will take you out.

261
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:22,200
You and I are destined to be rivals.

262
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,040
I see, my rival.

263
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,790
Very well!

264
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,080
I will use the move I invented
when I worked with Hawks,

265
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,040
Dark Fallen Angel.

266
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,250
Dark Fallen Angel?

267
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,000
Yes.

268
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Dark Fallen Angel.

269
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
FUMIKAGE TOKOYAMI, QUIRK: DARK SHADOW

270
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
HE MANIFESTS A SHADOW INSIDE HIS BODY
THAT IS FLEXIBLE AND FIGHT HIS ENEMIES

271
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
AFFILIATION: U.A. HIGH SCHOOL CLASS 1-A,
BIRTHDAY: OCTOBER 30TH

272
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
HEIGHT: 158CM, BLOOD TYPE: AB
FAVORITE FOOD: APPLE

273
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
HAWKS, QUIRK: FIERCE WINGS

274
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
ABLE TO MANIPULATE HIS FEATHERS
SHOOT THEM AS PROJECTILES

275
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
PRO HERO, BIRTHDAY: DECEMBER 28TH
HEIGHT 172CM

276
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
FAVORITE FOOD: CHICKEN

277
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,950
A FEW MONTHS AGO IN KYUSHU

278
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,410
He always settles everything on his own.

279
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,410
These are the real deal, real diamonds!

280
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,660
These should fetch me at least 300 million!

281
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,790
"HAWKS, QUIRK: FIERCE WINGS"
I got you.

282
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,700
Hawks!

283
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,580
You are too slow for me.

284
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,410
There is a brawl fight in the bar at Kante.

285
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,910
I have to go there next.

286
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,910
I'll leave the cleaning up to you.

287
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,000
Tsukuyomi.

288
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,910
I have to deal with this criminal.

289
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,290
Hawks is simply too fast.

290
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:34,950
This is the most efficient way to operate.

291
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:35,910
I'll go after him.

292
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,120
Tsukuyomi!

293
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,790
He sure is full of spirit.

294
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:45,410
It was the first time Hawks took part in
nominating a student.

295
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,410
I was always running after him during
the workplace training,

296
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,660
constantly cleaning up after
he had completed the job.

297
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,120
That raised a question for me.

298
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,500
If the damages spread

299
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,080
while my sidekicks were catching up,

300
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,660
wouldn't that be unacceptable?

301
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,120
But...

302
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,790
why did you nominate me?

303
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,500
Because we're both birds.

304
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,370
You're joking, right?

305
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,830
No, there's a little truth in that.

306
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:19,870
I need some information from those
in Class 1-A.

307
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:23,830
It's about the thugs from League of Villains
that attacked your class.

308
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,950
Since I've been looking for information,

309
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:30,790
I should get it from an outstanding student
who can catch up to me.

310
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,410
So I chose the bird guy who has...

311
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:37,000
a fairly high ranking
during the sports festival.

312
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:43,330
I need to know more about the USJ incident.
What can you tell me?

313
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:49,080
When I was about to tell him
the details about the USJ attack,

314
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,370
the unwillingness almost took over me.

315
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,790
I'm not a pigeon.

316
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,450
The workplace training ended
with me learning nothing at all.

317
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,450
How was your time in Kyushu?

318
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,910
Nothing special.

319
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,250
Nothing at all.

320
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,450
For my internship,

321
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,870
he accepted me once again.

322
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,910
Much had happened between the time...

323
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,910
of my workplace training and internship.

324
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,500
He must be after more information,

325
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,950
Hawks.

326
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,700
Don't look down on me, the No.3 Hero..

327
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,750
No.

328
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,540
He's the No.2 Hero now.

329
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,870
Tsukuyomi is so determined.

330
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,450
He has a bright future ahead.

331
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,540
Great work today.

332
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,370
Tokoyami, may I have a word with you?

333
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,500
What is it you want this time?

334
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500
I'm not going to ask questions.

335
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,250
Hawks!

336
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,700
We are flying like the wind!

337
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,700
You've never learned how to fly?

338
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,750
I'd say 20% of my reason for choosing you
was because we're both birds,

339
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,500
50% because I wanted to know more
about the League of Villains,

340
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:17,829
and the rest was because
you're wasting your time.

341
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:22,079
The sky is great.

342
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,700
You can see everything from above.

343
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,910
What do you mean I was wasting my time?

344
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,660
It's a sound plan to strengthen your skill
in close-quarter combat.

345
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,660
But never forget to develop
what you're already good at.

346
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,700
You can move more freely.

347
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,290
I never wanted to be a mentor.

348
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:47,120
But since we're both birds,
I guess it must be fate.

349
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,000
You belong in the sky if you can fly.

350
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,370
Don't limit yourself to the ground.

351
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,370
I will use the move I invented
when I worked with Hawks,

352
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,830
Dark Fallen Angel.

353
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,950
Dark Fallen Angel?

354
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,620
That sounds fun,

355
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,370
let's see what you got!

356
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,750
He is moving in the shadows!

357
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,250
I'd never expected them
to launch a solo assault.

358
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,870
It's the same situation as the first battle.

359
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,410
It's time to improvise.

360
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:33,580
But the place is full of pipelines.

361
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,080
There is no way to tell his location.

362
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,790
Tokoyami, are you all right?

363
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,120
Yeah.

364
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,080
Fumikage Tokoyami.

365
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,660
I'll take you out.

366
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm his target.

367
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,200
I bet that's what you think, Class A.

368
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,950
Our rivalry is destined.

369
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:58,160
I started psychological warfare
before the battle even began.

370
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,910
I made them think Tokoyami was my target.

371
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:04,120
They are certain of it, but they are wrong.

372
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,500
Scheming Hero,Vantadark,

373
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,660
that's how I roll!

374
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,450
Aoyama!

375
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:17,660
Help!

376
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,450
His scheme...

377
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,660
This is despicable.

378
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,830
Repent with the purest intent.

379
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,500
With my speed...

380
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,290
and the complex layout of this arena,

381
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,620
Dark Shadow and its master

382
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,660
are connected, which makes it hard
to navigate this place.

383
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,950
In that case,

384
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:39,750
they will never catch up to me!

385
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,410
Is that so?

386
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,370
Dark Shadow!

387
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,000
Dark Fallen Angel!

388
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,120
He is flying!

389
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,540
Tokoyami...

390
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,700
That is his new move!

391
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,750
How can he fly?

392
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,870
The principle is simple.

393
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,120
Dark Shadow is always floating in the air.

394
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,540
It can carry Tokoyami as it moves around!

395
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,450
Thanks to the mantle,

396
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:07,290
sunlight is blocked out, allowing it
stay active even longer!

397
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,830
The way Dark Shadow carries him
also allows for the use of his hands!

398
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,620
Dark Shadow is floating!

399
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,790
Everyone takes that feature for granted
and overlooks its potential!

400
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,410
It's simple yet hard to imagine!

401
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:22,950
Awesome! You're awesome, Tokoyami!

402
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,750
But never forget to develop
what you're already good at.

403
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,410
Hawks, you have my thanks.

404
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,660
I'll take it up a notch!

405
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,120
Twinkling Laser Date!

406
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,200
Plan A failed.

407
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,410
Aoyama, use your naval laser!

408
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,290
Tokoyami, keep flying.

409
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,250
Dark Shadow, grab the jacket!

410
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,540
All right!

411
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,120
I just need to disrupt the shadows!

412
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,250
Naval Buffet!

413
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,660
I found him Hagakure!

414
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,950
Yes, I'll get him this time!

415
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,250
That's as far as you can get.

416
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,040
There is nowhere to run.

417
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,160
We didn't expect you to operate solo.

418
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,120
But every unexpected outcome...

419
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,910
is already within my expectation!

420
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,120
You saw this coming.

421
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,080
Stop right there!

422
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,000
Surrender!

423
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,450
Mushrooms!

424
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,750
I knew it.

425
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,370
Kendo anticipated your expectations!

426
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,830
Just as Kendo foresaw.

427
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:40,200
If I see the light,
that means Kuroiro's plan A failed.

428
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,290
Plan B commences.

429
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:48,580
You'll all be covered in mushrooms.

NEXT EPISODE

450
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,950
Class A launches their counter-attack.

451
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:29,700
But the wide-range attacks
from Fukidashi and Komori...

452
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,410
has turned the battle into their advantage.

453
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:36,000
Not only that, Yaoyorozu is isolated.

454
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,620
What should Class A do now?

455
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,120
Next episode, Foresight!

456
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,370
Yaoyorozu predicted the battle,

457
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,830
she will start creating to secure their victory!

458
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,120
Go beyond!

459
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,040
Plus Ultra!
