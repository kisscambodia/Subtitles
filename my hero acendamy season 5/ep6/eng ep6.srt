1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,370
You don't seem to be taking this seriously.

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,000
Are we not worthy enough to fight you?

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,700
Bring it on, Class A!

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,120
Let's settle the score today!

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:17,830
CLASS A VS CLASS B

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:18,870
1ST BATTLE

7
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,160
Hero Course of U.A. High.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,410
Class A and Class B

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,330
are having the first round of

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,120
joint training battles.

11
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:37,080
Shinso's Quirk successfully disrupted
Class B's coordination,

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,660
securing victory for Class A.

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,700
2ND BATTLE

14
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,410
All right!

15
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,540
Let's go!

16
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,830
Yeah!

17
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,290
Proceed as we planned.
Please scout ahead,

18
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,410
Tokoyami.

19
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:52,450
Roger.

20
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,370
Dark Shadow!

21
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,790
Understood!

22
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,620
Report back to me when you found our enemies.

23
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,120
Leave it to me!

24
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,660
The second battle has begun.

25
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,330
I'll be right back.

26
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,910
Everyone, scatter!

27
00:01:13,289 --> 00:01:17,539
The surprise attack from Kuroiro of Class B
caught Class A off guard.

28
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:22,039
Help!

29
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:28,580
But Tokoyami countered with his new move,
"Dark Fallen Angel".

30
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,120
The battle...

31
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,750
is now seesawing between the two teams.

I found him, Hagakure!

44
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,160
Yes! We can catch him!

45
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,450
That's as far as you get!

"MOMO YAOYOROZU, QUIRK: CREATION"
But everything that is unexpected

49
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,870
is already within my anticipation!

00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,329
"SHIHAI KUROIRO"
Within your anticipation?

51
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:33,290
Stop right there!

52
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,870
Give it up now!

53
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,579
Mushrooms?

54
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,950
I knew it.

55
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,829
Kendo anticipated your expectations!

56
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,540
Just as Kendo foresaw.

57
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,160
If I see the light,
that means Kuroiro's plan A failed.

58
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,040
Plan B commences.

59
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,910
You'll all be covered in mushrooms.

60
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,370
FORESIGHT!

61
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,200
No!

People can see me with these mushrooms!
This is embarrassing!

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,750
MUSHROOMS

64
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,000
The reproductive power is incredible!

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,750
"FUMIKAGE TOKOYAMI, QUIRK: DARK SHADOW"
Mushrooms have covered the whole field.

"YUGA AOYAMA, QUIRK: NAVAL LASER"
I can't see Kuroiro.

67
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,580
This is...

68
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,790
It must be Class B's tactic.

69
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,330
Pezizales!

70
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,200

77
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,750
She can spread fungus spores from her body.

78
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,750
The spores spread better in humid environments!

79
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,830
The mushrooms can even grow on people?

80
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,580
"MINORU MINETA, QUIRK: POP OFF"
This is like a horror movie!

81
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,500
"YOSETSU AWASE, QUIRK: WELD"
Her mushrooms will disappear

82
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,450
after two to three hours.
There won't be any side effects.

83
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,200
This is also why she has a bad habit of
spreading the spores everywhere.

84
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,750
"OCHACCO URARAKA, QUIRK: ZERO GRAVITY"
The mushrooms are growing on the cameras!

85
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,040
"KYOKA JIRO, QUIRK: EARPHONE JACK"
This is so gross.

86
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,080
Our Plan A is to take control of Dark Shadow
to launch a surprise attack.

87
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,700
Our opponents will definitely
send Dark Shadow after us.

88
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,040
The is a low-risk yet highly efficient tactic.

89
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:42,330
They would never expect Kuroiro's
improved Quirk can take control of Dark Shadow.

90
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:45,040
That will be our chance to capture one of them.

91
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,159
Help!

92
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,870
It's easier said than done.

93
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,120
Nice speech.

94
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,870
What if I failed?

95
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,450
Wouldn't that put us at risk?

96
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:59,040
The opponent must use
light to counter your Quirk.

97
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,330
We can locate them with the light they emit.

98
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,290
When they unleash the light,
Dark Shadow can't attack as violently.

99
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,790
Even if Kuroiro failed,

100
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,330
we would be able to surround and take them out.

101
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,290
Plan A failed.

102
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,790
It's time to retreat for now.

103
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,750
Let's put Plan B into motion.

104
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,830
I'm counting on you, Kinoko!

105
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,830
The mushrooms keep popping up!

106
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,620
This is driving me crazy!

107
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,450
Judging by their two-phase combo,

108
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,950
they anticipated our tactic to counter Kuroiro.

109
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,290
Impressive, Kendo.

110
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,040
Everyone, calm down.

111
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,950
Let's regroup for now.

112
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,790

This is...

116

Something is coming out!

I'm so amazing.

118
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,910
The impact of that effect manifested perfectly!

119
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,450

He can even manipulate the
effect by using different onomatopoeia.

Pop! Da da da!

saved Kuroiro from his predicament.

00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,540
You can only create with matter
inside your body.

167
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,950
So you'll be the first to fall!

168
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,330
I can't stop.

169
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,700
It was the same during the sports day.

170
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,660
I mustn't give her the opening to think.

171
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,370
I'll overwhelm her with my raw might!

172
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:47,120
She gained the upper hand in a blink of an eye!

173
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,870
"TETSUTETSU TETSUTETSU, QUIRK: STEEL"
She has the perfect strategy!

174
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:53,040
I told you! She is brilliant
and she makes calm judgment!

175
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,750
That's our beloved Kendo!

176
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,290
"SHOTO TODOROKI, QUIRK: HALF COLD HALF HOT"
We don't know that yet.

177
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,910
If they are restraining Yaoyorozu
by isolating her from the team,

178
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,500
it might be a miscalculation.

179
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,660
Huh?

180
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,580
Yaoyorozu, you have a plan, right?

181
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,700
But even your plan didn't work.

182
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,370
There is no way I could...

183
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,000
Stop hesitating!

184
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,620
You're a better strategist than me!

185
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,290
You got two votes when we were
selecting our class rep.

186
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,370
I voted for you!

187
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,700
That was because I knew you're
capable of brilliant tactics!

188
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,540
I have a plan, Todoroki.

189
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,250
I have a solution.

190
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,200
I have a way to secure our victory!

191
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,500
I've had that plan in mind all along.

192
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,790
If they want to restrain Yaoyorozu,

193
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,370
they should have taken her out
with an all-out attack.

194
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,700
Maybe she had foreseen...

195
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,700
the situation she is facing right now.

196
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:07,120
Yaoyorozu has the better Quirk and grades.
But people are comparing me with her.

197
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,290
That really gets on my nerve.

198
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,620
That is not true, Kendo.
That's far from being true.

199
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,330
Even now, I'm still inexperienced.

200
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:22,040
But since you think so highly of me,

201
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,160
I can't show you the vulnerable side of me.

202
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,160
Since she anticipated the situation,

203
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,870
she will have a way to turn the battle around.

204
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,700
That's what she specialize in.

205
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,290
Momo.

206
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:44,580
Show them the result of your training.

207
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,250
I'll show them how strong I've become!

208
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,290
Are you kidding me?

209
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,120
She has a canon!

210
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:57,370
It takes quite a while to
build a weapon this massive!

211
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
MOMO YAOYOROZU, QUIRK: CREATION

212
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
SHE CAN CREATE ANY OBJECT FROM HER BODY

213
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
AFFILIATION: U.A. HIGH CLASS A,
BIRTHDAY: SEPTEMBER 23TH

214
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
HEIGHT: 173CM, BLOOD TYPE: A
HOBBY: READING

215
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
ITSUKA KENDO, QUIRK: BIG FIST

216
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
SHE CAN WRAP A PERSON WITH BOTH HER HANDS.

217
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
AFFILIATION: U.A HIGH CLASS B,
BIRTHDAY: SEPTEMBER 9TH

218
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
HEIGHT: 166CM, BLOOD TYPE: O
FAVORITE THINGS: BIKE AND BLACK COFFEE

219
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,370
I don't see Kuroiro anywhere.

220
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,080
I lost visual on Hagakure too.

221
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,250
Should we regroup with Yaoyorozu
on the other side?

222
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,790
Or should we...

223
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,540
Can't Stop Twinkling!

224
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,910
Help!

225
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,580
Mushrooms...

226
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,040
What?

227
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,620
Cursed fungi!

228
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,790
They got me!

229
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,500
Go!

230
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,450
My throat is starting to hurt.

231
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,790
Invisible Girl!

232
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,410
Not only did they isolate Yaoyorozu,

233
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,200
they can even hide themselves...

234
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,750
while using large-scale attacks
to surround us.

235
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,450
They are strong.

236
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,330
Strong and annoying.

237
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,410
Komori.

238
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,790
Fukidashi.

239
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,080
Kuroiro.

240
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,660
If we don't find out where they are hiding,

241
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,870
the battle is basically over.

242
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,950
I must find a way to break through this.

243
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,000
Are you kidding me?

244
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,750
She has a canon!

245
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:41,370
It takes quite a while to
build a weapon this massive!

246
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,450
"SEN KAIBARA, QUIRK: GYRATE"
She could kill someone with that thing!

247
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,410
She seems to like canons a lot.

248
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,910
Is she really going to fire that thing?

249
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,200
No...

250
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,540
Is she bluffing?

251
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,080
Will she tear down Fukidashi's wall?

252
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,870
Sorry if I startled you.

253
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,580
That was too close!

254
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,450
I have to expand my fists
before she fires the canon.

255
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,290
Double Jumbo Fist!

256
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,450
She didn't use it on the wall.

257
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,660
What did she fire?

258
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,620
From the moment you closed in
for close-range combat,

259
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,120
perhaps I was already losing.

260
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,910
However...

261
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,540
to secure our victory...

262
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,200
That sound...

263
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,870
It wasn't from Fukidashi.

264
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,660
It's from the other side of this wall.

265
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,290
That was...

266
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,160
Yaoyorozu!

267
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,410
Dark Shadow!

268
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,000
Roger!

269
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,870
YAOYOROZU'S LUCKY BAG

270
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,290
This is...

271
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,910
Hi, Komori.

272
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,250
What was that? I didn't catch that.

273
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,120
I caught him.

274
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,370
I caught Aoyama.

275
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:21,250
Nicely done, Kuroiro!

276
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,290
I'm counting on you to capture the rest of them.

277
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,040
Yes.

278
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,700
Well done, Kuroiro.

279
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,700
Our enemies have no idea where we are.

280
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,410
We'll keep pushing with my mushrooms.

281
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,290
OK.

282
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,160
Hey, Komori.

283
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,540
Mushroom?

284
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:49,750
Class A shouldn't know where we are, right?

285
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,660
Night-vision goggles.

286
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,250
I can see how they are spying on us.

287
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,500
When you stare into the abyss,

288
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,450
it's staring right back at you!

289
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,580
Lucky Bag?

290
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,830
Like a gift bag?

291
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,830
I can hold this.

292
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,620
This is...

293
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,870
Goggles and ethanol?

294
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,580
And disinfectant spray?

295
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,160
Judging by the design of these goggles,

296
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,120
I think they are meant for you.

297
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,120
She sent a message without using a single word.

298
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,700
Everyone, calm down!

299
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,500
Let's regroup!

300
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,000
Yaoyorozu,

301
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,160
did you foresee this...

302
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,790
all the way back then?

303
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,370
"THIS IS BAD"
Oh no...

304
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:51,950
Tokoyami is coming this way!

305
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,870
I'm right here for you.

306
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:59,290
I was curious why the mushrooms
don't grow on your team.

307
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,200
So you had already disinfected yourselves.

308
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,290
"I CAN'T SEE HER!)
Where is she?

309
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:06,200
I'm not going to tell you!

310
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:08,700
"WHERE IS SHE?"

311
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,619
STOP IT!

312
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:15,290
There will be an opening
as long as I can locate them.

313
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,540
He is headed this way!

314
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,200
You will not escape...

315
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,829
the gust of wrath!

316
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,700
Just as Hawks taught me,

317
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,700
speed will outshine raw power!

318
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,870
Abyssal Dark Body!

319
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,750
Sabbath!

320
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,660
Mushroom!

321
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,250
Komori!

322
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,370
He's fast...

323
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,700
No, I must hide in the shadow!

324
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,910
Are you looking for darkness?

325
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,910
Why don't you use my cloak?

326
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,870
Hey...

327
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:13,290
You're not a threat if you can't move.

328
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,200
Fumikage, I got the girl!

329
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,330
Incredible, he captured two of them at once.

330
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,160
This is a comeback!

331
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,290
This is all thanks to Yaomomo's items.

332
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,160
Yeah!

333
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,500
Hagakure has the upper hand as well.
They can win by outnumbering Kendo!

334
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,370
Dark Shadow, put them into jail.

335
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,160
Fumikage.

336
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,290
Sorry.

337
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:45,250
I don't like this move so I've kept it a secret.

338
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:49,950
But seeing our victory is at stake,
I have no choice but to use it.

339
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,580
My throat...

340
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,080
This is...

341
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,370
Schizophyllaceae that attacks your lungs.

342
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,750
Komori is not a powerful combatant,

343
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,950
"NEITO MONOMA, QUIRK: COPY"
but she is a force to be reckoned with.

344
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,620
You got sloppy thinking
this is merely training, Tokoyami.

345
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,330
You should have knocked her out first.

346
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,000
"CUT IT OUT!"
Eat this!

347
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,080
I can't see anything!
This is so confusing!

348
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,200
I must defeat Fukidashi so I can aid my friends!

349
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,500
"THAT HURTS"
Tokoyami and Yaomomo...

350
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,160
might be in danger!

351
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,580
Invisible Girl,

352
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,750
you're invincible!

353
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,330
I'm sorry for being late.

354
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:42,200
Kendo, you saved me.

355
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,330
What's with that?

356
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:50,250
Don't worry, I knocked her out.

357
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,870
But she got the better of me.

358
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,750
She tied herself on me along with the canon.

359
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,250
That makes it hard for me to move.

360
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:04,700
Everything she creates
is based on her foresight.

361
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,750
I just can't defeat her.

362
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,540
You saved us both, Komori.

363
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,910
It's only natural to help a friend, mushroom.

364
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,950
Kendo, Fukidashi, are you all right?

365
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,700
I think so.

366
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,120
Fumikage!

367
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:33,080
Komori, you used that spore?

368
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,160
We would have lost had I not used it.

369
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,790
Indeed.

370
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,290
Class A is formidable indeed.

371
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:44,040
They are very strong.

372
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,950
You bring honor to Class B, Kendo!

373
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,040
Great!

374
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,290
Yaoyorozu, I hope you don't
get depressed over this.

375
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:59,160
"MIDNIGHT, QUIRK: SOMNAMBULIST"
Yaoyorozu could make a great leader.

376
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,620
I feel so satisfied with their display
of Plus Ultra spirit.

377
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,830
They lost the battle,

378
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,000
but with Tokoyami's new move...

379
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
and Yaoyorozu's foresight for battle,

380
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,830
I can see you've grown much over time.

381
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:19,580
"ALL MIGHT, QUIRK: ONE FOR ALL"
You've taken another step forward.

382
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,410
One step closer to your dream.

383
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,000
One step closer...

384
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,410
to become a hero!

385
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,000
WELCOME

386
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,620
Second battle,

387
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,290
Class B won with a score of 4:0!

388
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,500
Well done, Class B! Congratulations!

389
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,410
Stop your bias broadcast!

390
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,910
"WE ARE AGAINST BIAS BROADCAST"
Stop it!

391
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,370
Congratulations!

Next episode!

412
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,000
It's the battle between Class A and Class B.

413
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,750
With both teams winning one battle,
the third battle is about to begin.

414
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,250
With Ida's speed...

415
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,870
and Todoroki's powerful Quirk,

416
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,750
they should have the advantage in this battle.

417
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,330
Fight on, Class A.

418
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,830
Next episode, The Third Match!

419
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:45,620
Class B will shine even brighter
with Honenuki's flexibility.

420
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,040
Go beyond!

421
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,000
Plus Ultra!
