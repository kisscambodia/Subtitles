00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,290
CLASS A VS CLASS B

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,660
Class A and Class B of U.A. High School

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,120
are having joint battle training.

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,290
In the fourth battle, Class A displayed
great teamwork with Kacchan as their main force,

5
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,540
and secured an overwhelming victory.

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,250
Now we proceed with the fifth battle!

7
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,830
This is the last battle of the day.

8
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,700
Are you ready?

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,870
Do not let your guard down until the very end!

10
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,370

It's No. 1541.

22
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,870
He's on the move again.

23
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,040
It's happened so many times since yesterday.

24
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,000
I hope the verdict and execution

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,750
can be done as soon as possible.

26
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,120
At this rate, we won't be able to keep up.

27
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,040
Do you think taking one life make you a murderer

28
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,950
but taking millions of lives makes you a hero?

29
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,410
Is that a line from Chaplin's movie?

30
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,160
It just happened recently.

31
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,120
Gigantomachia.

32
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,700
He served All For One directly.

33
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,500
It's not just Shigaraki's League of Villains.

34
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,750
Who knows how many are sharing
the same ideal with this guy?

35
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,290
It's best not to provoke them for now.

36
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,750
Oh my, I'm sorry for the trouble I caused.

37
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,040
The nostalgia is giving me an itch.

38
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,450
I can hear my little brother's voice.

39
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,200
THAT WHICH IS INHERITED

40
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:22,660
You have a phone call...

41
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,450
"ALL MIGHT, QUIRK: ONE FOR ALL"
Excuse me.

42
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,120
"MIDNIGHT, QUIRK: SOMNAMBULIST"
Just hang up the phone.

43
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,120
GRAND TORINO

44
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,579
Sorry, but I have to answer this call.

45
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,950
I appreciate you calling me so soon.

46
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,579
But I'm in the middle of a lesson.

47
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:40,120
It's about Izuku Midoriya's dream.

48
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,700
Have you started talking just now?

49
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,410
"GRAN TORINO: QUIRK: JET"
You asked me whether Shimura said

50
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,579
anything about One For All's visage.

51
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:52,200
Since you asked, it actually jogged my memory.

52
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,829
But it's from a time so long ago.

53
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:56,870
So don't expect too much from me.

54
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,830
It happened soon after
Shimura inherited One For All.

55
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,580
Listen to me, Gran Torino.

56
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,660
I had a weird dream last night.

57
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,580
A dream?

58
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,790
Yeah. A dark and misty guy appeared
right before me.

59
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,750
That guy looked at me and said,

60
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,910
"It's not the right time yet."

61
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,660
Well, that's about it.

62
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,950
Thank you, sir.

63
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,659
Excuse me, but I'm still in the middle
of a class. I must hang up now.

64
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:40,290
"It's not the right time yet."

65
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:44,700
That means, the time will come sooner or later.

66
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,250
Has One For All's heir

67
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,620
"IZUKU MIDORIYA, QUIRK: ONE FOR ALL"
inherited something else?

68
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,250
Class B has Shinso on their team.

69
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,950
I mustn't talk to him when we meet.

70
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:59,659
I'm still wary about One For All's secrets.

71
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:03,290
I can't afford to be brainwashed by Shinso.

72
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,870
Ever since I was a kid,
people have been telling me

73
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:13,540
I could never become a superhero with my Quirk.

74
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,660
"HITOSHI SHINSO, QUIRK: BRAINWASH"

75
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,450
Why are you telling us now?

76
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,160
I mean, I know I can't do it by myself.

77
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,450
I won't last long if their Quirks
aren't compatible.

78
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,250
I do admire you.

79
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,870
We share quite the similarities.

80
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,870
I don't like that.

81
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,750
But that's a fact.

82
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:37,700
How did you manage to brainwash Midoriya?
How did you make him talk to you?

83
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,700
I didn't know what kind of person he was,

84
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,790
so I mocked his classmates.

85
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:48,540
In order to become a hero,
we have to act the other way around.

86
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,790
Otherwise,

87
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,620
we won't be able to overcome
the power that can do anything.

88
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,290
Our goal will become unclear.

89
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,870
Have you felt this before?

90
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,830
Your childhood dream and hope

91
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,910
slowly became your burden as you grow older.

92
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,330
It's like a curse.

93
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,500
The formation of Midoriya's team

94
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,200
"TENYA IDA, QUIRK: ENGINE"
is similar to Bakugo's team.

95
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,410
"HANTA SERO, QUIRK: TAPE"
They share the same team balance.

96
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,660
But Jiro's role...

97
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,200
I was the scout of my team.

98
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,410
They don't have a scout.

99
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,290
They must be more cautious
so the enemies don't decimate them.

100
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,330
"KYOKA JIRO, QUIRK: EARPHONE JACK"
You have a point.

101
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,790
If they want to bait the enemies
to locate them,

102
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:36,750
"KATSUKI BAKUGO, QUIRK: EXPLOSION"
Midoriya has to take more risk than Bakugo did.

103
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,290
I need to draw their attention
and act as a decoy.

104
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:45,830
I doubt Class B can overlook my speed.

105
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,080
I will draw their attacks.

106
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,540
That should help me locate them.
Then our team can proceed with the capturing.

107
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,580
They are here!

108
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,910
It's Yanagi's Quirk, Poltergeist!

109
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,950
Monoma's here!

110
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,160
Oh my, you found me.

111
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,290
After seeing Bakugo's coordination,
we're going to just ignore you.

112
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:21,120
Being wary of a strong and agile opponent

113
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,500
is what normally the smart would think.

114
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:28,620
But anyone smart enough
would also think otherwise.

115
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:34,750
Bakugo did so well because
of their excellent teamwork.

116
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,120
This is why we should take down
the other three first.

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,290
I bet you drew our attention to locate us.

118
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:46,909
But on the other hand, my teammates
are almost in range to attack yours.

119
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:48,750
He is provoking me.

120
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,120
Perhaps he already copied Shinso's Quirk.

121
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,450
It's three against four.
Are you sure they can hold up?

122
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:59,500
We also have Shinso on our team.
You can get into contact unnoticed.

123
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,500
Perhaps you should go to your teammates now.

124
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,870
Wait.

125
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,750
What if the screaming was Shinso's voice?

126
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:13,580
Then you had already exposed the location
of your team.

127
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,580
This must be troubling for you.

128
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,160
That was cold. You didn't bother
to look at your teammates' direction!

129
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,700
He is trying to locate them
with my line of sight. I won't fall for it!

130
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,250
Such a nuisance.

131
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,660
Class B, Neito Monoma.

132
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,830
Hero name: Phantom Thief.

133
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,500
Quirk: Copy.

134
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,289
Once he touches the target,
he can use their Quirk freely for five minutes.

135
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:41,330
But he can't use two Quirks at the same time.

136
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,950
He is using Yanagi's Quirk!

137
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,330
Release.

138
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,040
"MINORU MINETA, QUIRK: POP OFF"
The noises just now...

139
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,540
"OCHACOO URARAKA, QUIRK: ZERO GRAVITY"
It wasn't me.

140
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,160
Was it Shinso? He's closing in.

141
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,330
"MINA ASHIDO, QUIRK: ACID"
I'd love to see his dull face

142
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,200
"MINA ASHIDO, QUIRK: ACID"
when he starts yelling for help!

143
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,830
Please look at us when you talk.

144
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,910
I got something.

145
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,410
Acid Veil!

146
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,330
It's gone.

147
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,870
Did they block it? Or was it a trap?

148
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,620
It's Yanagi's poltergeist!

149
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,370
She is attacking blindly!

150
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,750
Class B, Reiko Yanagi.

151
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,500
Hero name: Emily.

152
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,370
Quirk: Poltergeist.

153
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,700
She can control objects around her,

154
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,330
but the maximum load is about
the weight of a person.

155
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,120
Class B, Yui Kodai.

156
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,660
Hero name: Rule.

157
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,120
Quirk: Size.

158
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,120
It's the ability to manipulate
the sizes of objects.

159
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,290
But she can't use the Quirk on creatures.

160
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,750
Release.

161
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,580
Twin Impact!

162
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,790
Fire!

163
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:18,450
I can roughly tell where they are heading.

164
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,160
Class B, Nirengeki Shoda.

165
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,870
Hero name: Mines.

166
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,000
Quirk: Twin Impact.

167
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
His Quirk allows him to strike a target and
inflict a second impact on the point of contact.

168
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,700
The second impact is several times
stronger than the initial blow.

169
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,080
Split up. Don't let them spot you.

170
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,000
I am reloading the second batch.

171
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,040
That was scary.

172
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,330
Where is Midoriya?
He's supposed to be our decoy.

173
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,660
They might have caught our location
from the attack just now.

174
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,160
Where is Deku?

175
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,290
I talked to Shinso.

176
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:59,040
The privileged will bring the world to ruins.

177
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,120
Since you're his friend, then tell me.

178
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,330
How can Bakugo

179
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,580
laugh as if nothing is happening?

180
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,660
He was captured by the villains.

181
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,410
Wasn't he the one who destroyed

182
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,580
our symbol of peace?

183
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,790
That guy looked at me and said,

184
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,620
"It's not the right time yet."

185
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,160
The right time. But when is it?

186
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,830
What's going on?

187
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:51,910
He has more abilities I didn't know.
This is getting annoying.

188
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,330
Why? What is this?

189
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,870
Everything was normal up until just now.

190
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,080
Run!

191
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,200
Shinso!

192
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,790
Shinso...

193
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,660
Run!

194
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,370
I can't...

195
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,370
control this power!

196
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,870
I can't hold it anymore!

197
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,500
What is that?

198
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,250
Deku!

199
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,120
What is going on? Stop it!

200
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,700
What is this? Stop it!

201
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,080
It hurts!

202
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,870
Why?

203
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,950
Midoriya has a new attack.

204
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,200
Aizawa, Vlad!

205
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,080
We should stop him now.

206
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,700
"SHOTA AIZAWA, QUIRK: ERASURE"
Something is not right.

207
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,700
Why?!

208
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:19,830
Ever since I inherited the Quirk from All Might,

209
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:23,120
There are too many things I don't understand
while I was badly injured.

210
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,540
Stop it now!

211
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,910
Even so...

212
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:33,200
I finally learned to control this power!

213
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,500
Stop it now! One For All!

214
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,160
I don't want to make anyone worry again!

215
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,040
Deku! Calm down!

216
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
NEITO MONOMA, QUIRK: COPY

217
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
HE CAN COPY THE QUIRK OF THE TARGET HE TOUCHES
FOR FIVE MINUTES

218
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
AFFILIATION: U.A. HIGH SCHOOL CLASS 1-B,
BIRTHDAY: MAY 13

219
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
HEIGHT: 170 CM, BLOOD TYPE: A,
FAVORITE THINGS: FRENCH FOOD AND COMICS

220
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
OCHACCO URARAKA, QUIRK: ZERO GRAVITY,
THE ABILITY TO REMOVE THE GRAVITY

221
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
ON ANYTHING OR PERSON SHE TOUCHES.

222
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
AFFILIATION: U.A. HIGH SCHOOL,
BIRTHDAY: DECEMBER 27

223
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
HEIGHT: 156 CM, BLOOD TYPE: B,
FAVORITE FOOD: JAPANESE CUISINES

224
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
My parents always looked so exhausted.

225
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,410
It pains me to see them so tired.

226
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,250
When I first witnessed the mission
of a pro hero...

227
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,620
Compared to the hero that saved the day,

228
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,500
I'm more attracted to the cheers of the crowd.

229
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:28,750
I like to see the happiness on their faces.

230
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,330
In my eyes, helping those in need is my duty.

231
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,500
And that duty...

232
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,870
could come with great risks and challenges.

233
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,500
Even if I try my best,

234
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,200
he never stops helping those in danger.
And that inspires me.

235
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,080
Deku!

236
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:00,330
Who is there to protect the heroes
when they are in need?

237
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,330
I can't control it at all!

238
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,500
This isn't Deku's doing.

239
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,870
Shinso!

240
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,450
Brainwash him now!

241
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,200
Help me stop Deku's rampage!

242
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,000
She wants me to brainwash Midoriya...

243
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,370
But what should I say?

244
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,580
You defeated me on the sports day.

245
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,000
I've been excited since then.

246
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,080
I want you to see how much I've grown.

247
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,410
I've looked forward to meeting you
in a battle.

248
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:53,660
I want to become a true hero
that saves lives with my Quirk!

249
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,040
Midoriya!

250
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,540
Fight me!

251
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,250
Very well!

252
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,040
I'm here again.

253
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,870
Hey, you!

254
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,580
Are you kidding me?

255
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,450
No!

256
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,830
Didn't I tell you?

257
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,370
I told you you weren't alone!

258
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,790
I told you the time had come.

259
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,410
Haven't you noticed?

260
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,500
However,

261
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,410
this power...

262
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:54,330
is not something you can control
while your mind is full of distractions.

263
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,200
He was one of the heirs...

264
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,830
You need to work harder!

265
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:05,119
If you work hard enough,
you can figure out most of the problems!

266
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,200
Can't you talk?

267
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,700
Don't mind!

268
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,750
I can see him so clearly...

269
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:15,579
This is more than just a blurry visage.

270
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:17,700
It's not a dream either.

271
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,619
This man...

272
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,540
These people...

273
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:26,700
Are they all living inside One For All?

274
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,580
It seems like we're running out of time.

275
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,870
Hey, young man.

276
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:37,540
The power you wield right now is my Quirk.

277
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,450
Our Quirk factors are mixed up
inside the core of this power.

278
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:46,370
They have existed inside
One For All's tiny core.

279
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,620
It's like a flickering flame.

280
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,120
Or you could say it's like a dot
on the glittering water.

281
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:57,660
It's been buried under the power you've
cultivated so far. This is its primal state.

282
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,080
That core is now expanding.

283
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,080
It's begun to move.

284
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,870
Like a flickering image in the crevice,

285
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,580
the power of One For All...

286
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,660
is growing.

287
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,000
What is going on?

288
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,250
Hey.

289
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,750
Were you trying to capture or grab that target?

290
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,370
I bet that was your plan.

291
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:29,660
I wanted to capture Monoma.

292
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,750
The best Quirk that responds to that thought
is my Quirk, Blackwhip.

293
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,910
You should be grateful I'm the first one
you've ever met.

294
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,700
This is a wonderful Quirk.

295
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,580
However,

296
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:47,450
due to the accumulated power of One For All,

297
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:50,500
this Quirk is much stronger
than when I wielded it.

298
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,910
Well, I'm disappearing now.

299
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,620
I used to float around like a specter.

300
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,040
That's because my consciousness
is what's left of me.

301
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:06,700
Listen closely. If you use the power with rage,
it answers your call.

302
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,200
So your priority...

303
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,370
is to control your mind.

304
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:16,450
Having rage is a good thing.
It's the source of power.

305
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:22,000
That's all the more reason
to focus on controlling your rage.

306
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,250
After being held by eight users,
One For All is powerful beyond imagination.

307
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,790
Listen closely, young man.

308
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:34,080
Another six Quirks will manifest in your
in the future.

309
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,160
Learn to master your mind,
use these abilities as yours.

310
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,910
All the best, young man!
We're watching over you!

311
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,080
The only one who can make One For All whole...

312
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,330
is you!

313
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,160
Deku!

314
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,830
Deku!

315
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,750
Deku!

316
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,660
Did that hurt?

317
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,200
Uraraka...

318
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,910
Stay away from me!
It's too dangerous!

319
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:01,870
Don't worry.

320
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,700
Shinso's brainwash calmed you down.

321
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,700
Shinso...

322
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,870
Are you all right?

323
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,410
Uraraka, you're hurt!

324
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:19,080
My goodness, what have I done?

325
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,620
Gunhead Martial Arts!

326
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,450
The match is not over yet!

327
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,250
Release.

328
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,450
Fire!

329
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:42,330
Those rampaging black tentacles
ruined our attack plan.

330
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,330
Nice timing!

331
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,250
Are you all right?

332
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,200
What was that just now?

333
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,870
I found you! Eat this!

334
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,540
Midoriya! Uraraka! Are you all right?

335
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,370
Everyone is here!

336
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,910
Let's get ready to rumble!

337
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:00,250
Eat this!

338
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:05,620
If you use the power with rage,
it answers your call.

339
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,000
So your priority is to control your mind.

340
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,250
I can't let anyone else get hurt.

341
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,040
What should I do now?

342
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,870
I feel like my mind is going to explode!

343
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,080
Eraser Head, how should we proceed?

344
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,950
All Might.

345
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,290
Let's observe for a little while.

346
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,790
Aizawa, what do you mean?

347
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,040
The fifth battle...

348
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,950
should proceed.

Next episode!

369
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,290
One For All went on a rampage.

370
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,660
It's too risky to use the Quirk again.

371
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,580
But I'm not giving up on the battle.

372
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,700
Shinso and Monoma aren't going to
give up either.

373
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,910
I must give it my all,

374
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:40,160
for my team, and to secure our victory!

375
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,700
Next episode, Our Brawl!

376
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:46,290
Remember why you took on this path!

377
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,500
Go beyond!

378
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,040
Plus Ultra!
