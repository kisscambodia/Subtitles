1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,200
It's my first high-school life.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,830
The second semester was about to end.

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,660
I'm all fired-up!

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,540
Hagakure, don't you feel cold?

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,410
It's freezing out here!

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:19,250
Everyone's costume has changed a lot
since we first came to U.A. High.

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:23,250
Ida, that suit looks toasty.
I can't believe you survived the summer in it.

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,790
Kacchan's suit looks different too.

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,540
Say it to my face!

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,500
Hey...

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,660
You seem to be slacking off.

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,700
Bring it on, Class A!

13
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,040
Let's settle the score today!

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,370
CLASS A VS CLASS B

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,660
The Hero Course of U.A. High.

16
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,700
Class A and Class B...

17
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,410
will soon have their joint training.

18
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:59,250
Shinso who wants to transfer to Hero Course
has joined this battle.

19
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,250
With that, the first battle began.

20
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,620
Class A soon ran into a predicament.

21
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:20,250
♪When we are stranded on the same spot,
make our heart beat♪

00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:25,910

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
BEFORE THE FIRST BATTLE

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,410
In case some of you didn't know,

33
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:49,450
I'll explain to you how my Quirk,
"Brainwashing" works.

34
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,250
First of all, I must focus on one single target.

35
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,250
I must have the thought
of controlling the target.

36
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,329
With that as a foundation,

37
00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:00,160
as soon as the target talks to me,
I can seize control of them.

38
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,790
They will move as I order.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,910
There are different degrees of brainwashing.

40
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,750
But the target can break free
after taking damage.

41
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,330
I haven't tried this before,

42
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,120
but brainwashing multiple targets is impossible.

43
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,040
I'll get distracted.

44
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,700
Even so, your Quirk is still very potent.

45
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,200
"HITOSHI SHINSO, QUIRK: BRAINWASHING"
However,

46
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,120
I can't target under my control speak.

47
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,120
Orders that require thinking won't work either.

48
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,750
I can show my target the name "Tsuyu Asui".

49
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,540
I order the target to copy that name.

50
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,410
"WHAT IS THE FROG GIRL'S NAME?"
But I can't ask my target...

51
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,540
"PLEASE WRITE DOWN HER NAME."
to use that name as an answer.

52
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,790
"DENKI KAMINARI, QUIRK: ELECTRIFICATION"
This is common for heroes,

53
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,370
but we are doomed if the weakness
of our Quirks are known.

54
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,250
They can just ignore your voice.

55
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,750
Which is why I need this device.

56
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,120
It works like a vocal cord.

57
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,079
This mask can mimic different voices.

58
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,250
The Persona Chord.

59
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,790
My Quirk won't work through
microphones or speakers.

60
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,370
So it must be your own voice.

61
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,580
Yes.

62
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,330
The countless plates in this mask
can shift and resonate...

63
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,660
to change my voice and send it out
as a different voice.

64
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,500
TSUYU ASUI, QUIRK: FROG

65
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,700
Which means...

66
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,660
That means...

67
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,910
it's a voice changer.

68
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,910
"EIJIRO KIRISHIMA, QUIRK: HARDENING"
That is awesome! You have the strongest Quirk!

69
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,500
The first battle begins!

70
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,450
The battle has begun.

71
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,370
We don't have a strategy yet.
I guess we'll have to improvise.

72
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,580
How strong can this device be?

73
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,040
"JUROTA SHISHIDA"
That's up to me!

74
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,909
Nice!

75
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:44,750
Send him flying, Shishida!

76
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,120
You can count on me!

77
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,790
"KOSEI TSUBURABA, QUIRK: SOLID AIR"
That was my voice...

78
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,620
Thank you for saving me!

79
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,000
He copied my voice and took control of Shishida!

80
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,080
That guy...

81
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,830
MAKE IT HAPPEN, SHINSO!

82
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,830
Before he wakes up...

83
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,750
You're too slow!

84
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,910
Air Prison!

85
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,290
Wake up, Shishida.

86
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,910
Wake up!

87
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,200
Shinso from General Education.

88
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,370
Damage and impact can break his brainwashing.

89
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,910
Shiozaki told me about this Quirk.

90
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,250
I didn't know he could change his voice.

91
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,950
You fool! Stop!

92
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,620
If you touch me,

93
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,409
you get shocked!

94
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,950
That hurts...

95
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,659
I electrocuted him

96
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:54,450
how is he still standing?

97
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,750
Shishida!

98
00:05:58,659 --> 00:05:59,909
I got you!

99
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:01,120
Nice!

100
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,250
Take him to the prison, Tsuyu!

101
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,250
Seriously?

102
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,700
You should have passed out!

103
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,250
Shishida from Class B.

104
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,450
"RIKIDO SATO, QUIRK: SUGAR RUSH"
Such incredible strength.

"OCHACCO URARAKA, QUIRK: ZERO GRAVITY"
Tsuyu...

00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,910
Don't worry.

107
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,750
"IZUKU MIDORIYA, QUIRK: ONE FOR ALL"
Class A...

108
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,700
can count on him!

109
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,370
Koda!

110
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,500
That air wall can't be very durable.

111
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:39,540
It's surprisingly tough!

112
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,450
Well...

113
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:44,330
I'll strike again!

114
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,950
"KOJI KODA, QUIRK: ANIVOICE"
Kirishima...

115
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,200
I'll send him to the prison.

116
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,040
OK!

117
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,290
You shall not pass!

118
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,950
My tiny friends,

119
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,160
lend me your strength!

120
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,250
Red Gauntlet!

121
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,410
I'm in human form again!

122
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,290
Jurota Shishida, Quirk: Beast.

123
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,080
Activating this Quirk will
make him increase in size.

124
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,450
When deactivated,
his body goes back to normal size.

125
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,700
Beast form once again!

126
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,700
The only who can match my strength
is probably Kirishima.

127
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,040
In that case...

128
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,200
That direction...

129
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,000
Hey, wait!

130
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,790
"IBARA SHIOZAKI, QUIRK: VINES"
A lost lamb descends from the heavens.

131
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,500
"TENYA IDA, QUIRK: ENGINE"
They got Kirishima!

132
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,250
Even so,

133
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,250
Asui got Tsuburaba as well.

134
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,750
"SHOTO TODOROKI, QUIRK: HALF-COLD HALF-HOT"
The score is now even.

135
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,950
KATSUKI BAKUGO, QUIRK: EXPLOSION

136
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,909
It's far from even.

137
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,540
I can't speak.

138
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,120
He's too strong!

139
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,370
I knew it!

140
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,830
But Koda is still quite a handful to deal with.

141
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,250
Carrying him during a battle
puts me at a disadvantage.

142
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,660
It's time to retreat.

143
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,500
I'll finish this match with life advantage!

144
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,450
HIRYU RIN

145
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,830
That 2:1 for us.

146
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:39,120
Sorry, Koda.

147
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,120
They got me, however...

148
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,830
She wrapped me with her tongue!

149
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:59,450
This barrier is much harder than
what we saw on the sports day!

150
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,950
Class B is really strong.

151
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,200
This must be the fruition of
their intensive Quirk training!

152
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,330
Is that right?

153
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,700
Both teams have already started undermining
their opponents' combat strength!

154
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,750
Shishida and Tsuburaba did a great job!

155
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,250
Both teams have equal number of combatants.

156
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,750
But Class B seems to be holding up
much better with their morale!

157
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,500
"PRO HERO VLAD KING, QUIRK: BLOOD CONTROL"
My students' ferocious attacks...

158
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,580
might finally bring Class A to its knees!

159
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,830
"NEITO MONOMA, QUIRK: COPY"
That's our teacher Vlad King!

160
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,660
"WE'RE AGAINST BIAS BROADCAST"
Vlad King,

161
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,120
"VLAD KING, WE WANT A FAIR BROADCAST"
don't be so biased!

162
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,370
"HANTA SERO, QUIRK: TAPE"
Shishida is too strong. He's a threat.

163
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,450
His nose can sense anything.

164
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,790
"PRO HERO SHOTA AIZAWA, QUIRK: ERASURE"
Shinso...

165
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,950
It's undeniable that he lacks experience.

166
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,910
Judging by the way he used the binding,

167
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,790
he only had them made
after knowing the situation.

168
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,620
It seems like he still lacks
the speed for real combat.

169
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,250
To utilize Shinso's strong point...

170
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,540
What now, Tsuyu?
We'll lose at this rate.

171
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,660
It took us some time to
understand Shinso's Quirk.

172
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,330
They caught us off-guard.

173
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,580
I should have acted faster...

174
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,410
with my binding.

175
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:09,910
Sorry...

176
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,580
We should apologize.

177
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,080
We let you fight them head-on.

178
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,200
It's my fault for coming up with that strategy.

179
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,870
Speaking of which,

180
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,370
injury is very common in combat training.

181
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,080
Thankfully, you acted fast.

182
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,370
I was saved thanks to you.

183
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,040
Thank you for saving my neck.

184
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,750
I know you're not interested
in becoming our friend,

185
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,450
but I like you a lot.

186
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,540
You really do want to become a hero.

187
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,500
It's nothing.

188
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,330
We should figure out our next plan.

189
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,250
I have an idea.

190
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,830
Kaminari, look at the navigator.

191
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,290
Navigator?

192
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,040
You used me as a decoy to initiate the attack.

193
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,370
Such sinful action.

194
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,790
You deserve flogging.

195
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,580
Flogging?

196
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,040
But I pulled off a great feat.

197
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,450
We only need to catch three from Class A
to win this battle.

198
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:17,160
We know about Shinso's voice changer.
If we can catch him,

199
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,040
we can still secure the victory
by ignoring Kaminari.

200
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,120
Shinso...

201
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,370
Losing Tsuburaba took a toll on our ranks.

202
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,290
This is...

203
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,160
What is it, Shishida?

204
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,000
I don't know how this is happening.

205
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,410
But there is no doubt about it.

206
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,500
I can sense three Asui coming this way.

207
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,620
Three Asui?

208
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,830
Is this their strategy
against your sense of smell?

209
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,200
In that case,

210
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,120
I should teach them a lesson.

211
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,750
Your plan...

212
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,040
will only lead to foulness.

What is Shishida talking about?

223
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:16,580
Tsuyu is not like Ectoplasm.

224
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,830
They can't be her clones.

Midoriya, that's...

226
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,700
Yes, it is.

227
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,580
Tsuyu told us about it,
but we've never seen her use it before.

228
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,910
I'll tell you more about my Quirk.

229
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:34,370
I can jump far and stick to walls.

230
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,790
I can also stretch my tongue.

231
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,950
It can reach over 20 meters away.

232
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,950
I can take out my stomach to wash it,

233
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,910
I can also secret venomous slime.

234
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:47,080
But the slime will only paralyze the enemies.

235
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,080
Venomous slime!

236
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,330
She covered both of them with her slime
to mask their scents!

237
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,620
We almost forgot her ability.

238
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,290
I bet Class B didn't see this coming.

239
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:01,080
Kaminari, check your navigator.

240
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,870
Navigator?

241
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:06,750
I put a tracker on Shishida when I attacked.

242
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,750
"MY ADORABLE BABY ACADEMIA"
You can stick the tracker to any surfaces.

243
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,160
You can also use the visor
to locate your target.

244
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,120
You actually prepared for everything, Tsuyu.
You're awesome.

245
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,160
You're amazing for not noticing it.

246
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,830
Shishida can pinpoint our location.

247
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,790
My nose can sense anything!

248
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:34,790
It's best to assume
he has our location at all times.

249
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,750
We'll use that to our advantage.

250
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,160
We all smell like Tsuyu.

251
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,160
He can't tell who we are unless
he sees it in person!

252
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,700
He hasn't noticed the tracker yet.

253
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,250
There is no sudden movement either.

254
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,700
We need to deal with his other teammates.

255
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,660
We don't know where they are.

256
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,040
Rather than searching for them,

257
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,370
we should take down Shishida while we can.

258
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,410
His nose and strength are too powerful.

259
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,250
Tsuyu, how are you holding up?

260
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,540
He sent your flying just now.

261
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,290
I managed to avoid any serious injury.

262
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,290
But I won't hold up for long
if we face him head-on.

263
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,830
In the name of Vine,

264
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,000
punish the treacherous evildoers!

265
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,910
Via Dolorosa!

266
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,620
Beast of Revelation, reveal their locations!

267
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,330
Ten o'clock! Twelve o'clock! And two o'clock!

268
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:33,200
They are splitting up and closing in!

269
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:38,370
And stop calling me the Beast of Revelation!

270
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,370
I am Gevaudan!

271
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:44,700
They are closing in.
So they know where we are.

272
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,410
Do they have a scouting Quirk we don't know?

273
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,160
Hey, Beast of Revelation,

274
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,540
there's something stuck on you.

275
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,500
This came from Kaminari.

276
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,040
I got one.

277
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,950
I'll drag you out!

278
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,410
We don't know who that is.

279
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,950
Find cover, Shishida!

280
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,750
If it's Kaminari...

281
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,330
Yes, you got it right!

282
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,120
But you chose the wrong target!

283
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,000
All of you are here,

284
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,250
start holding hands and get electrocuted!

285
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,700
Crucifixion.

286
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:20,500
What?

287
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,200
Faith's Shield!

288
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,790
I sealed off his electricity
with layers of vines.

289
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,580
I can even use this as a shield.

290
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,370
It's a flawless execution.

291
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,540
I tricked you.

292
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,540
As long as the navigator is within 10 meters,

293
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,750
my electricity...

294
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,370
can form a straight beam!

295
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,120
Give me a break!

296
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,450
That was so close!

297
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,910
Hiryu Rin.

298
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,500
Quirk: Scales.

299
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,080
He can form hard scales with his body.

300
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,290
He can shoot them as projectiles
or wear them as armor.

301
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,950
Reset the vines now!

302
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,250
Yes. Shishida, give me their location.

303
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,870
That wasn't my voice!

304
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,080
It's Shinso's voice changer!

305
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,580
Come on, look at those vines!

306
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,750
Is Shiozaki still with them?

307
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,200
It's over if she catches us. Let's fall back.

308
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,790
No, I have an idea.

309
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,660
Let her catch me.

310
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,870
Let her catch you?

311
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,000
They are wary of me.

312
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,500
That means, I'm a real pain in their necks.

313
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,200
On the sports day,

314
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,830
she put up a huge pile of vines
to stop my current.

315
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,910
If I annoy her enough,

316
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,290
the vines will thin out.

317
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:55,450
Then, Shinso and Tsuyu, it's your opening.

318
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,200
Come on.

319
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:05,540
I never underestimated Kaminari,

320
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,079
but his experience in combat
makes a difference.

321
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,369
So this is the Hero Course's strength.

322
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:23,829
We have no idea where the voice came from.

323
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:27,040
He used the environment for reflection of sound.

324
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,750
Shishida, where are they?

325
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,080
Is someone there?

326
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,330
Hey, talk to me!

327
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:40,080
Just look at my mouth and you'll be safe!

328
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,870
I need to wake up Shiozaki.

329
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,910
Your scale shots won't hit her!

330
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,370
Asui!

331
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,040
She is really agile.

332
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,330
Shishida, it's Asui!

333
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,950
He is not listening...

334
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:11,870
Judging by the scent, I can tell
Tsuyu is right over there.

335
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:14,660
That means,

336
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,080
this scent here came from Shinso!

337
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,750
Shinso!

338
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,500
You said you were falling behind.

339
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,750
But you're a terrifying foe.

340
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,870
You're a real threat!

341
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,700
Not bad.

342
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,160
I won't fall for the same trick!

343
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,160
Eraser Head's Binding Cloth!

344
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,870
Capturing Cloth!

345
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,660
I see...

346
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,830
However...

347
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,250
Villains won't be defeated so easily...

348
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,040
with your puny trick!

349
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,580
I'm right behind you!

350
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,700
Enough!

351
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,910
I'm behind you, Beast!

352
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:20,250
You can't brainwash me again!

353
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,700
Beast?

354
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,700
Get out of the way!

355
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,450
Sorry for that.

356
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,950
Yeah!

357
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,620
A stunning performance!

358
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,620
Shinso, that was too close.

359
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,290
How is this match balanced?

360
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:47,290
No, Asui and Kaminari figured out a plan...

361
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,250
and put Shinso's Quirk to good use.

362
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,950
This is so cool.

363
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,790
Asui's slime masked their scents.

364
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,040
That confused Shishida's nose.

365
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,450
Then he used the voice changer
to bait their opponents,

366
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:02,410
stopping them from communicating.

367
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,950
Under the right circumstances,

368
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:08,950
his very presence can dominate the field!

369
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,080
Brainwashing...

370
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,950
This Quirk is far more
formidable than I thought.

371
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,750
With his new support device and capturing cloth,

372
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,790
he's totally different from the person
I met on the sports day.

373
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,700
I guess he had been secretly training.

374
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,660
It can't be helped, I want to be a hero.

375
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,330
To realize our dream...

376
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,250
To become a true hero...

377
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,450
WELCOME

378
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,450
Shiozaki! Shiozaki!

379
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,620
Why am I inside the prison?

380
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,120
I was brainwashed?

381
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,950
Lord!

382
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,700
Please forgive my foolishness!

383
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,120
Shiozaki! Shiozaki!

384
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,950
I'm already falling too far behind.

385
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,660
Sorry, but I'll give it my best.

386
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,120
Forget it. You can't catch up to us.

387
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,660
Shinso, you're already too strong.

388
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,660
I have a long way to go.

389
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,660
I will need guidance.

390
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,290
I will become a pro hero with my own strength.

391
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,700
CLASS A WON!

392
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,750
The victory of the first battle...

393
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,500

NEXT EPISODE

414
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:26,120
The second battle between Class A and Class B
is about to begin.

415
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,450
Class B learns from their mistake
in the first battle.

416
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:33,200
They came up with a more refined tactic
with Kendo as their focus.

417
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:39,080
Tokoyami's Dark Shadow is at a disadvantage,
can Class A overcome their predicament?

418
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,120
Operation New Improved Moves!

419
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,120
We'll finally see Tokoyami's new move!

420
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,370
Go beyond!

421
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:50,000
