1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,000
CLASS A VS CLASS B

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
1ST BATTLE

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,870
Hero Course of U.A. High.

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,580
Class A and Class B are having
the first round of joint training battles.

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,700
2ND BATTLE

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,370
The third match began after each class
has won one battle.

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,290
THAT HURTS!

8
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,290
3RD BATTLE

9
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:20,120
Class A managed to launch a preemptive strike
on Class B with Todoroki's attack.

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,790
But Honenuki's Quirk turned the match
to their advantage.

11
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:29,290
Class B is slowly gaining the upper hand.

12
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,750
Curse it!

13
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,870
Sorry.

14
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,700
There is a time limit to your Recipro.

15
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,120
You shouldn't have used it
right from the start.

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,580
All right. I should give Tetsutetsu a hand.

17
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,290
Time limit?

18
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,700
That's a long time ago, Mudman.

19
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:54,370
Ingenium will never be absent from a fight.

20
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,700
My legs exist for that sole purpose!

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,700
Right now,

22
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,200
I'm always going full-throttle!

00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,870
I am unstoppable

36
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,620
for the next ten minutes!

37
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,200
Are you trying to take me down
with your new move?

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,540
However...

39
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,580
He's too fast!

40
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,250
He's going too fast!

41
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,200
I still don't have full control over it.

42
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,790
No, this is bad.

43
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,829
There is no way to fight him.

44
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,120
Surrender yourself, Mudman!

45
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:33,579
"JUZO HONENUKI, QUIRK: SOFTENING"
Sorry.

46
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm not foolish enough to fight my opponent
while I'm at a disadvantage.

47
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,620
It's not safe to leave Ida rampaging.
But I can't fight him right now.

48
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,910
In that case, I should hurry to aid Tetsutestu.

49
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,660
TENYA IDA, QUIRK: ENGINE
He undid the effect on the ice.

50
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,750
Is he hiding to start a retaliation?

51
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,120
He should know by now
how futile that would be.

52
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,160
Did he leave to aid his teammates?

53
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,160
THE THIRD BATTLE'S CONCLUSION

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,620
"OCHACCO URARAKA, QUIRK: ZERO GRAVITY"
Ida is moving so fast!

55
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,200
"IZUKU MIDORIYA, QUIRK: ONE FOR ALL"
Recipro Turbo...

56
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,580
"MINORU MINETA, QUIRK: POP OFF"
He is even faster than Gran Torino.

57
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,329
Your shoot style somehow inspired Ida

58
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:20,290
to figure out his own fighting style.

59
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,450
I should ask him for advice on kicking.

60
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,660
"MINA ASHIDO, QUIRK: ACID"
Enough! Look at Ojiro!

61
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:38,370
"KYOKA JIRO, QUIRK: EARPHONE JACK"
Ojiro is fighting as usual.

62
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,000
"HANTA SERO, QUIRK: TAPE"
He may be at a disadvantage,

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,330
but he has learned much over time!

64
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,620
Go for it!

65
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,500
My chest hurts!

66
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,450
You can't win a fight by simply dodging.

67
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,700
"MASHIRAO OJIRO, QUIRK: TAIL"
He can easily reflect my attacks.

68
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,080
"SEN KAIBARA, QUIRK: GYRATE"
I can try guarding it,

69
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,540
but his support item is too sharp
and tough to withstand.

70
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,200
You're a mean one, Kaibara!

71
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,450
Eat this!

72
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,120
Ida?

73
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,410
I'll put Spiral into the prison now!

74
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,370
I'll be gone for a moment,
but it won't take long!

75
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,410
Ojiro, help the others!

76
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,870
I think Mudman is already on his way!

77
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,080
I'll be right back!

78
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,330
Understood!

79
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,790
Even the speed of his speech has become faster.

80
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,250
Let me go! It should be my turn to shine!

81
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,250
Stay still!

82
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,500
I won't let my opponent have any chance
to defeat me!

83
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,870
Did you let Honenuki get away?

84
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,500
You know how troublesome he can be.

85
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,080
Anyone else would have gone after him instead.

86
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,200
You shouldn't interrupt my fight, Ingenium!

87
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,700
My brother would do the same.

88
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,620
He is the hero I must become!

89
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,250
If I stray away from my standard
during training,

90
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,540
the same thing will happen in a real battle.

91
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,540
You're so stubborn.

92
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,250
Indeed. People tell me that a lot.

93
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,250
Steel Fist!

94
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:19,290
He hardened his entire body, so being
partly frozen won't hinder his performance.

95
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,540
His hardened skin doesn't even peel off.

96
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,370
Tetsutetsu, I will learn much from you.

97
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,660
"KATSUKI BAKUGO, QUIRK: EXPLOSION"
Stop using your ice, it's not working on them.

98
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,200
You're acting like a wimp.

99
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,620
"TETSUTETSU TETSUTETSU, QUIRK: STEEL"
Your ice wall means nothing to me!

100
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,790
I will crush it with my fists of justice!

101
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,000
"SHOTO TODOROKI, QUIRK: HALF COLD HALF HOT"
In that case...

102
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,830
I'll put on a wall of flame for you!

103
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,250
Ouch!

104
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,700
Shoji! Take care of Tsunotori!

105
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,909
All right!

106
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:49,370
Back down, I must create a distance between him.

107
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:54,250
Why am I fighting you?

108
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,659
I bet you didn't know.

109
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:59,450
Your attacks won't work on me at all!

110
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,370
He's turning red from the heat.

111
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,080
My steel is burning red!

112
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,450

00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,410
"PONY TSUNOTORI, QUIRK: HORN"
Fight, Real Fist!

114

This is how my Quirk has improved!

115
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,450
Have you ever lived inside a burning furnace?

116
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:21,870
Tetsutetsu, restrain Todoroki!

117
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:26,580
Subdue him in close combat and stop him
from using wide-range attack!

118
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,700
Half Cold Half Hot...

119
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,330
Your Quirk won't work on me!

120
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,830
This is...

121
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,040
the fruition of my hard work

122
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,250
for going beyond my limits!

123
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,450
Push your heat to its limit!

124
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:48,330
Then go beyond that limit!

125
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,540
There is no way you can't do it.

126
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,620
You're simply not trying hard enough!

127
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:57,200
I'll keep punching until I knock you out.

128
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:01,250
Feel it.

129
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:05,700
The power within you is stronger than anyone!

130
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,040
Why now?

131
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,540
Why am I thinking of him now?

132
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,160
Curse it...

133
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,160
Prepare to lose!

134
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,080
If my ice and fire can't hurt him...

135
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,700
With this,

136
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,750
you'll become the perfect incarnation of myself!

137
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,200
Isn't that part of your power too?

138
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,870
Back down.

139
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,950
That burns!

140
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,539
More flame...

"VLAD KING, QUIRK: BLOOD CONTROL"
The camera broke down from the heat.

More flame...

144
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,870
I can still generate more heat.

145
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,790
Burn on!

146
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,410

Young Todoroki...

He is using Endeavor's flame.

It's burning me!

I keep burning metal inside my body.

161
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,040
I know you're suffering.

162
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,080
I doubt you could last long in this state.

163
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,580
Well then...

164
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:00,580
Endurance is my specialty!

165
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:04,080
Go beyond!

166
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,910
You...

167
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,000
I won't let you get away
with just some burn marks.

168
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
If you can't risk your life in training,
you won't risk your life in real battles!

169
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,040
Superiority and limits

170
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,080
are meant to be broken!

171
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,540
You are talking too loud.

172
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,700
I can still feel the heat at this distance.

173
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,120
I should go support Real Steel now.

174
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,540
"MEZO SHOJI, QUIRK: DUPLI-ARMS"
Sorry, Tentacole.

175
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,290
I always skip the octopus when I go
to a public aquarium.

176
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,080
I don't like it.

177
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm used to being feared by everyone.

178
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,200
I'll send you to the prison.

179
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,080
Let's settle the score now.

180
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,410
That's more like it.

181
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,450
Thunder Horn!

182
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,660
Octoblow!

183
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,080
I'm winning.

184
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,040
No!

185
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,910
Thanks, Ojiro.

186
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,910
Tornado Tail Dance!

187
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,910
You won't be a threat to us
if you can't fire your horns.

188
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,200
The way you got me...

189
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,370
It's so darn ordinary!

190
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,580
I'll take her to the prison.
Aid Todoroki now.

191
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,540
Honenuki?

192
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,750
I'm taking Tsunotori back.

193
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:40,330
I'm a surprisingly loyal friend.

194
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:45,000
When he struggles to break out,
his tail will loosen up.

195
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,830
Curse it!

196
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,790
Fist of Tail: Swamp Smack Spin!

197
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,330
I got you.

198
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,700
Thanks.

199
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,250
He put so much power into shaking me off.

200
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,200
Please step aside, Honenuki.

201
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,290
I won't let go even if you stab me!

202
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,620
I don't need you to loosen up!

203
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,040
Ojiro!

204
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,580
I'll use my horns

205
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,700
to send you into the prison!

206
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Under any circumstances,

207
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,950
you're disqualified
when you step into the prison.

208
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,160
The score is 1:1.

209
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,750
What's wrong? Your flame has gone weaker.

210
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,200
Todoroki!

211
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,450
Your movement is getting slower too.

212
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,950
I feel dizzy.

213
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,540
I can't move my body.

214
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,410
If I want to cool down,

215
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,700
I must first knock this guy out.

216
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,330
Go beyond.

217
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,580
Tetsutetsu, you're going to melt.

218
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,040
Honenuki...

219
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,870
This is bad. I'm losing my consciousness.

220
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,500
Solidify.

221
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,620
I won't miss again!

222
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,160
Mudman!

223
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,910
That burns...

224
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,120
Hey you...Don't you run away from me.

225
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:49,620
You should save him first.

226
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,700
When there is a lost child,
I take them to the Lost Children Center.

227
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,830
That's the coolest anyone can be.

228
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,790
Mind your tongue, villain!

229
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,870
Saving lives must always be the priority!

230
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm going to pass out.
If he lands that attack...

231
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,660
To think he said he couldn't
control this power yet...

232
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,580
It's a fatal mistake to leave Ida rampaging.

233
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,870
We're going to lose.

234
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:25,620
When I pass out, the Quirk effect will be gone.

235
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,950
I can't leave items to help my team
as Yaoyorozu did,

236
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,000
I don't feel frustrated.

237
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,370
I feel defeated.

238
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,120
However...

239
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,620
I can't let my mistake be the cause

240
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,410
of our defeat!

241
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,700
Tetsutetsu! Push this!

242
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,620
What was that?

243
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,870
All combatants are down!

244
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:32,410
But they are still in the battle
until they are sent to the prison!

245
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,910
What will happen now?

246
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,330
That hurts...

247
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,290
My left arm and leg...

248
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,910
It's too heavy.

249
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,750
I can't move with just one leg.

250
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,700
Todoroki, I've failed you.

251
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,870
If I could just move faster...

252
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:55,330
Had I reached you sooner back then...

253
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,250
Ida is still conscious,
but he's unable to battle!

254
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,870
I think Kaibara's struggle
had taken a toll on him.

255
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:08,410
He struggled hard after being captured,
contributing to Ida's demise!

256
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,790
Well done, Kaibara!

257
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,290
You're the MVP of the day, Kaibara!

258
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,580
Vlad King is starting his bias broadcast again.

259
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,540
Class A and Class B each have one prisoner.

260
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,200
Four combatants are down.

261
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,830
All that is left is...

262
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,250
Todoroki!

263
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:36,370
I can't let Shoji toss them into the prison.

264
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,790
But what should I do now?

265
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:41,330
I can't defeat Shoji even
with all my horns attacking.

266
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:45,450
I lose for sure if I fight him head-on.

267
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:49,080
We'll be in the lead if I send
Todoroki to the prison first.

268
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,830
But I have three unconscious teammates.

269
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:55,120
He might catch up to me before
I even reach the prison.

270
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,870
It's over if I lose.

271
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,330
I got you!

272
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,369
Well then...

273
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:05,750
Is she...

274
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:11,450
I'll wait for my chance somewhere
you can never reach.

275
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:15,579
I can't win, but I won't lose either.

276
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:18,040
Sorry, Tentacole!

277
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,869
I don't want my team to lose.

278
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,450
She took her teammates and Todoroki to the sky.

279
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:29,290
Shoji's can't fly even with his Quirk.

280
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,120
She got away.

281
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,330
Deku, what is Class B up to now?

282
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:37,120
My guess is they are playing it safe.

283
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,910
Shoji would put her teammates into
the prison if she put them down.

284
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,580
Why is she taking Todoroki with her?

285
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,370
If Todoroki woke up,

286
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:49,000
it would be impossible to dodge
his ice and flame, even while flying.

287
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,620
She is taking him as a precaution.

288
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:56,120
But she can't win unless
she puts him into the prison.

289
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,910
It can't be helped.
But the outcome is almost certain.

290
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,290
They are running out of time!

291
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,080
Time's up!

292
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,370
The third battle ends!

293
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,750
Both teams got one prisoner! It's a tie!

294
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,040
This doesn't feel good at all! It sucks!

295
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,700
"JUROTA SHISHIDA, QUIRK: BEAST"
If this was a real battle,

296
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,160
the best way is to retreat and wait for backup.

297
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,250
Ida.

298
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,870
It must be hard for him to accept this.

299
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,790
However...

300
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,910
He was awesome.

301
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,500
Too many combatants are unconscious.

302
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,950
Like the second battle, we'll start
the post mortem meeting later.

303
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,120
Get ready for the fourth battle!

304
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,450
RECOVERY GIRL, QUIRK: HEAL

305
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,870
Todoroki!

306
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,500
You're finally awake.

307
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,830
Have a calorie bar.

308
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,330
Ojiro finished his and went back.

309
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,830
Todoroki!

310
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:12,500
I know the battle ended with a draw.
But I feel defeated!

311
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,620
Your flame was insane!
We should fight again!

312
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,040
You are too loud.

313
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,330
A draw...

314
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,330
Had I moved faster,

315
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,160
we could have won.

316
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,540
Ida...

317
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,790
I wasn't fast enough.

318
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:31,200
I couldn't overcome Honenuki's

319
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,120
flexibility in battle.

320
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,000
But you saved me.

321
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,620
I can remember as much.

322
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:42,160
Not to mention I made the first mistake.

323
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,790
We would have been trapped
had you used your flame more fiercely.

324
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,870
I'm used to striking preemptively with my ice.

325
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,120
No, that mindset had been
planted into my muscles.

326
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,120
You were fast enough.

327
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,750
But I couldn't react in time.

328
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,290
I made you worry because I was too slow.

329
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,790
I must become the hero people can count on.

330
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,120
No, you're definitely reliable...Ouch!

331
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:23,410
I must make it in time for everyone
no matter what danger awaits.

332
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:26,330
This is the spirit I inherited from Ingenium.

333
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:35,950
Your flame and his Recipro...
I have some problems to deal with too.

334
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,290
Could we train together sometimes?

335
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,040
Of course.

336
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,000
Go back there if you're feeling all right.

337
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,830
Stop chitchatting in my infirmary!

338
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,290
Yes! We're so sorry!

339
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,700
There is no way out of this.

340
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,160
Class A and Class B have the same score.

341
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,950
We can win if we lose or end up with a tie!

342
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,910
"NEITO MONOMA, QUIRK: COPY"

343
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,330
He just has to let it out sometimes.

344
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,790
I'm so excited for the fourth battle!

345
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:10,580
After all, we have Tokage with us!

346
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,830
Isn't that right? Bakugo?

347
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,790
All right, let's go.

348
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,620
Setsuna Tokage.

349
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,500
Another student from Class B
who got in through official recommendation.

350
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,410
She is a tough opponent!

351
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,790
Kacchan.

352
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:30,830
Hold on, are you serious?

353
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,660
Are you kidding me? Your strategy...

354
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,700
That's right.

355
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,540
Wait and see, stupid Deku.

356
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,830
We'll start after everyone is in position!

357
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:45,870
The fourth battle! Start!

358
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:46,870

The fourth battle begins with
both teams scoring one point so far.

380
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:32,410
Class A is sending out Jiro,
Sero, Sato and Kacchan.

381
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,160
But Class B has Tokage on their team.

382
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,200
Watch out, she is likely to set up traps.

383
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,370
Next episode, Early Bird!

384
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,830
Kacchan changed his fighting style?

385
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,250
No, he's evolved!

386
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,540
Go beyond!

387
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,950
