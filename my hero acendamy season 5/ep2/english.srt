That's all we have to say, Hawks.

You're a smart one.

The hostages' safety was on the line
during the battle at Kamino.

To quell the evil forces,

You fix your eyes on

That aside, I must ask,

106
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,200
that Nomu charged straight at us back then...

107
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,580
on the day we arrived...

108
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,200
Was that really a coincidence?

109
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,700
Two heroes walking by the station could
draw a lot of attention.

110
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,040
That's why the enemies got their eyes on us.

111
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,250
This is disheartening.

112
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,909
We walked on the street, drawing attention
so I could have a good excuse.

113
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:42,330
Anyway, the rumor about Nomu
was probably meant to bait us out.

114
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:46,000
We should contact the investigation team.

115
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,540
Be cautious.

116
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,409
If you plan to continue your investigation,

117
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:53,950
as a precaution to deal with more Nomu like
the previous one,

118
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,080
you will need help.

119
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,830
Endeavor would never be so thoughtful!

120
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,750
Isn't that right?

121
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,910
I'll burn you to a crisp!

122
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,660
I'll continue my mission
when my feathers are fully grown.

123
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,080
It'll take another day or so.

124
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,290
Endeavor, don't you need some rest?

125
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,540
I'll think about it.

It's merely a proposition.

129
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,250
We must operate on both fronts...

130
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,330
to cut off any escape route
for the League of Villains.

131
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,370
You call this a proposition?

132
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,789
You only said that because you knew
I wouldn't turn it down.

You're a cunning bunch.

You should be glad you didn't
make it in time to Kamino that day.

136
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,290

137
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,830
You're saying a kid saved you?

138
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,290
Everyone survived that horrible accident.

139
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,790
It's hard to believe.

140
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,790

141
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,500
Move out!

142
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,410
The kid has gifts.

143
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,660
He should become a hero.

00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,540
Welcome home!

162
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,870
It's been a while.

163
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,000
Shoto even requested for an outing to come home.

164
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,540
I invited his teacher to come in,

165
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,750
"PRO HERO SHOTA AIZAWA, QUIRK: ERASURE"
but he refused.

166
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,660
"TODOROKI FUYUMI"
Anyway,

167
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,330
you managed to pull through that mission,

168
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,200
isn't that right?

169
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,620
Your scar looks scary.

170
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,830
TODOROKI NATSUO

171
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,700
You two, we agreed to
throw Dad a welcoming party.

172
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,160
After all, he finally started
to care about his family!

173
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,790
You can hate him but don't make it so obvious.

174
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,950
I can hear you from here.

175
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,580
Sister, sorry. But I can't do this.

176
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,750
Natsuo!

177
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,000
Natsuo, you can tell me.

178
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,500
How dare you...

179
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,200
say my name.

180
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,950
I only found out Shoto likes soba noodles today.

181
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,160
That's because you forbade failure like us
to even talk to him.

182
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,870
Stop looking, Shoto.

183
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:55,000
You don't belong in their ordinary world.

184
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,750
Fuyumi and Mom somehow forgave you,

185
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,950
but you've always been the same mad man to me.

186
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,450
You may look different, but you never changed.

187
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,160
You never care about us.

188
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,580
You may be the No.1 Hero
and defeated powerful foes,

189
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,790
but I'll never forget the things
you had done to us.

190
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:14,580
Mom's screams, and Shoto's cries,

191
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,700
it was the same for Toya!

192
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,450
You so selfishly trying to turn over a new leaf,

193
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,620
to make up for the terrible things you had done,

194
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,580
it's disgusting!

195
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,370
I've decided to make up to you.

196
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,250
As if!

197
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,080
Sorry, Sister. Thank you for the meal.

198
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,250
Natsu!

199
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,580
Come on...

200
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,040
It didn't work as I expected.

201
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:46,000
Shoto started to visit Mom again.

202
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,200
We've become closer with you.
Mom is smiling again too.

203
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,200
I thought we could have a chance
to be a family.

204
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,700
I was actually happy about all of this!

205
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,870
Shoto!

206
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,080
Sister.

207
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,870
I've never seen Natsuo so upset in the past.

208
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,290
It's been two days since the battle.

209
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,500
"THE DECLINING REPUTATION"
The public's rating for the No.1 Hero...

210
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,200
"THE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING THE NO.1 HERO"
is still declining.

211
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,620
"CITIZEN OF THE AREA"
Is he really all right?

212
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,660
He was covered in blood when he fought.

213
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,160
He let the villain slip away again.

214
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,660
I thought they had already caught
a bunch of Nomu.

215
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,540
If one Nomu is enough to put him in a pinch...

216
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,200
People are still questioning his capability.

217
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,790
Turn it off!

218
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,080
-On the other hand...
-No.

219
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:34,040
Who is the one fighting for us?

220
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,410
Take a good look!

221
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,540
"A MAN IN HIS 20S"
I used to be Edge Shot's fan.

222
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,250
How can I not be Endeavor's fan
after witnessing his epic battle?

223
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,790
"A MAN IN HIS 30S"
I can use flame as well.

224
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,700
So I feel glad to his performance.

225
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,660
"A COUPLE IN THEIR 20S"
This is all thanks to that kid on the TV.

226
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,830
"Take a good look!"

227
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,120
"TAKE A GOOD LOOK!"
The young man who made a wave on the news...

228
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,750
has been dubbed "Take A Good Look".

229
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:55,040
His outcry has brought Endeavor more popularity.

230
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,580
-It's the kid from the other day...
-Endeavor fought gallantly,

231
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,290
but Hawks played a huge role in the battle too.

232
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,700
I heard about it.

233
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,370
The things you created...

234
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:08,200
are slowly crumbling, yet you cannot see it.

235
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,580
Endeavor is the latest trend.

236
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,370
I'll admit Endeavor is a spectacular hero.

237
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,160
There is no doubt about it, however,

238
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,870
I don't think Natsuo is wrong.

239
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:27,870
Even now, I still can't forgive you
for what you did to Mom.

240
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:35,700
I want to see what steps
you'll take as a father.

241
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,700
From my experience,
it takes merely a single moment...

242
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,370
to make people change.

243
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,790
I became the No.1 Hero in an unexpected way.

244
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:50,410
The confusion and frustration in my heart
never stop haunting me.

245
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,540
What is the purpose of my power?

246
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,660
What is your reason to remain strong?

247
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:03,120
Endeavor...The answer to that question
is a simple one.

248
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,040
His words reminded me...

249
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,370
of the simple and natural thought.

250
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,330
I must protect their future.

251
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,120
If that is my duty for being at the top,

252
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,080
what about the future I've ruined
with my own hands?

253
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,620
I don't expect forgiveness from them.

254
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,790
Dad, why are you leaving too?

255
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,870
Fuyumi.

256
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,040
I'm sorry for what I did in the past.

257
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,500
What I said to Natsuo was wrong.

258
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,120
I can only atone for my mistakes...

259
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,290
and give them a future they deserve.

260
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,290
That day...

261
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,160
"IZUKU MIDORIYA, QUIRK: ONE FOR ALL"
after the fitness exercise,

262
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,080
I continued with my training
to master One For All.

263
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,830
I was so tired I fell asleep
without taking a shower.

264
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,700
Then I had a dream.

265
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:20,450
Standing next to me was a beautiful lady
who looked like a veteran.

266
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,450
Next to her are people I didn't know.

267
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,120
That's...

268
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,200
I had seen this in the past.

269
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,450
No, the image is much clearer this time.

270
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:37,080
They are predecessors of One For All.

271
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,750
I can't speak.

272
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,080
I can only move my right hand.

273
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,950
My legs are gone.

274
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,580
The last two people in the line...

275
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,500
One cultivates the power...

276
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,910
and pass it down to another person.

277
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,580
Then the cycle goes on.

278
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:02,160
Souls crying out to be saved and those with
brave hearts link to form an essence of power!

279
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,750
There are seven of them...

280
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,080
There are eight, including me.

281
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,000
They are the predecessors of One For All.

282
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,200
I'm the ninth wielder.

283
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,450
The one remaining is...

284
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,500
Join us.

285
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,450
My silly yet lovable brother.

286
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,870
Why do you resist?

287
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,580
That voice...

288
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,500
I will never forget that voice!

289
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,950
All For One!

290
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,330
Your way is wrong.

291
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,410
It should be forbidden!

292
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,370
Everything you've done is wrong!

293
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,910
A younger brother?

294
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,790
His brother?

295
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,000
He is the first wielder!

296
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,620
That was a little too harsh.

297
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,660
I've come for you, after all.

298
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:52,580
Is tolerance not part of your moral compass?

299
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,540
The world is in chaos.

300
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,500
You shouldn't abuse your power
for personal gain.

301
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,750
All you ever wanted is
satisfying your selfish desires!

302
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,540
They haven't noticed my presence.

303
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,450
Is this only a memory?

304
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,290
Come to me.

305
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,790
His jaw has mutated.

306
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:16,410
His tusks will only grow longer.

307
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:21,250
He is a gentle soul who takes great care
of his elderly parents.

308
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:25,410
But people shunned him,
saying he's a monster or ill.

309
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:29,040
They quarantined him
so he can't visit his parents.

310
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,620
This man has no special power.

311
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:36,200
He was attacked by a group of ability users
on his way back home at dusk.

312
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,950
The stun-gun failed him.

313
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:43,330
Hair moving like tentacles kept him bound.

314
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,910
No! You're only making it worse!

315
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,000
Please.

316
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,290
Hurry.

317
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:10,120
If ever I require your assistance,
would you be willing to lend me a hand?

318
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,830
Certainly.

319
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,750
Father, Mother...

320
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,000
Thanks.

321
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,790
I will never forget your kindness.

322
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:23,620
What is this world you speak of, little brother?

323
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,830
People are using their power for themselves.

324
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,790
Don't twist the meaning!

325
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:33,080
You merely made those two your goons.

326
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,120
People need something they can rely on.

327
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:41,700
Denying my act of kindness would be
denying their right to happiness.

328
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,080
Humans come in many forms nowadays.

329
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,700
I have the power to bring balance to this world.

330
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,330
So who is the one trying to prove his point?

331
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:55,500
You took advantage of
the weakness in their hearts!

332
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,450
I bet you wouldn't care to remember the names
of those you abandoned like trash!

333
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,620
I won't allow you to disrespect him!

334
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,790
Hey, watch it.

335
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,580
My brother is very frail.

336
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:14,500
Poor thing. You were born without any power.

337
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,080
But without power, you can't convince anyone.

338
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,660
Even so, I still love you.

339
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,790
My poor brother...

340
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,750
My only family.

341
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,660
If you're willing to help my cause,

342
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,910
I'll give you what you desire.

343
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,830
A choice for those without power,

344
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:40,040
forgiveness for the sinners!

345
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,910
Did you refuse to eat?

346
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:50,290
You can barely stand up.

347
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:54,580
I won't let you do as you please.

348
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:58,040
A group of people is abusing their powers.

349
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,000
They ganged up and refused to join my cause,

350
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,200
denying the balance of this world.

351
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,250
That brought them to their demise.

352
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,200
I never gave any order to kill them.

353
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:17,450
Those who admire me simply acted on my thoughts.

354
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,620
It's a sight to behold!

355
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,160
I told them my vision, and they took action!

356
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,500
One could only dream for this to happen!

357
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,950
It's like the world we read about
in a comic book.

358
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:33,200
You gave up after three chapters.

359
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,910
But the story goes on.

360
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,330
In a world reigned by a demon lord,

361
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,790
heroes of justice are battling evil.

362
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:42,910
They manage to save everyone's life.

363
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,700
Brother, don't you know?

364
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,330
Evil will always fall.

365
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,040
My dream is now the reality.

366
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,200
In reality, even the best-laid plans
sometimes go wrong.

367
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,040
Now I'll wipe away the reality
where you refuse to bow down to me.

368
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,330
You mean the world to me.

369
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,830
Stop...

370
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:10,290
I found a power even
a weakling as you could use.

371
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,620
Join my cause.

372
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,000
Stop it!

373
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,870
You must be the ninth wielder.

374
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,160
I was hoping to show you more,

375
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,830
but 20% is the best I can do at this moment.

376
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,580
Be cautious.

377
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,950
The singularity has passed.

378
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,830
Fear not.

379
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,040

NEXT EPISODE

400
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,580
The changes of One For All still confuses me,

401
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,660
but I still undergo combat training as usual.

402
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:32,410
It's a clash between Class A and Class B.

403
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:36,160
I must master the power of One For All
and seize victory.

404
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,580
Next,

405
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,450
Clash! Class A vs. Class B!

406
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:45,540
So you're the special guest?

407
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,120
Onward!

408
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,950
Plus Ultra!
