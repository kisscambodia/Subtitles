1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,790
Hey...

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,120
You don't seem to be taking this seriously.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,080
Bring it on, Class A!

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,660
Let's settle the score today!

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,450
CLASS A VS CLASS B

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,450
1ST BATTLE

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,790
Hero Course of U.A. High.

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:25,700
Class A and Class B are having
the first round of

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,330
joint training battles.

10
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,540
Shinso's participation secured
a victory for Class A.

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,120
2ND BATTLE

12
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,160
In the second battle,

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,910
Kendo's tactic

14
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,580
even the field as Yaoyorozu employed
her sharp analysis of the battle.

15
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,250
But after a fierce battle, Class B won.

16
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,830
The score is now 1:1.

FUMIKAGE TOKOYAMI, QUIRK: DARK SHADOW

28
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,700
I'm sorry, Tokoyami.

29
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,079
Do you need some cough drops?

30
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,750
You shouldn't show me sympathy.

31
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,450
I have an idea.

32
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,750
I'll get some medicines from Recovery Girl.

33
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,500

MOMO YAOYOROZU, QUIRK: CREATION

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,120
You can't improve without training.

35
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,410
Humans are so pathetic.

36
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,000
Why should we carry the wounded?

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,250
Just ask for your school nurse.

38
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,450
This damage caused quite some damage.

39
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,620
It's on a different level compared
to the first battle.

40
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,450
This is normal for Hero Course training.

41
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,910
But the destruction they caused
is a little too much.

42
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,620
"VLAD KING, QUIRK: BLOOD CONTROL"
Fukidashi and Kendo!

43
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,830
You should know better!
Reduce the damage to minimum!

44
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,500
"MANGA FUKIDASHI, QUIRK: COMIC"
Yes!

00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,450
Sorry.

00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,580
Vlad.

47
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,620
How long will it takes for the mushrooms
to disappear?

48
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,870
It should take another two hours or so.

49
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,700
"SHOTA AIZAWA, QUIRK: ERASURE"
Then we should use the other arena.

50
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,329
Let's take a break.

51
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:25,579
THE THIRD BATTLE

52
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:30,250
It's a total victory for Class B!

53
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:35,579
I bet we are going to win just as we did
during the school festival!

54
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:38,450
"NEITO MONOMA, QUIRK: COPY"
But Class A, don't feel disheartened.

55
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:42,370
The difference in our strength
is simply too obvious!

56
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,200
Sorry about that.

57
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,200
That guy is always so full of himself.

58
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,660
Why would he provoke us if he knew
Kendo would knock him out?

59
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,290
"DENKI KAMINARI, QUIRK: ELECTRIFICATION"
By the way, don't you think Class B

60
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,700
"TORU HAGAKURE, QUIRK: INVISIBILITY"
has quite some unique characters?

61
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,290
Not at all. Your class is much cooler.

62
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,160
Fukidashi, I can't believe you can make
something so huge!

63
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,290
But my throat will become dry and itchy.

64
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,330
I'll just have to put up with it.

65
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,450
I know this is expected,
but aside from their improvements in Quirks,

66
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:13,450
their mental development makes
their Quirks even stronger.

67
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,000
There he goes again.

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Deku, you've become much stronger too.

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,290
I wish that were true.

70
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,700
You have a long way to catch up to me.

71
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,910
No way.

72
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,870
I'm not talking about my height!

73
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,910
"ALL MIGHT, QUIRK: ONE FOR ALL"
I managed to sneak in.

74
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,540
Al Might?

75
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,409
Young Midoriya, may I have a word?

76
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:34,500
Sure.

77
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,200
A honeymoon?

78
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,620
Midoriya seems to have grown closer
with All Might lately.

79
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,080
He's been asking All Might to supervise
his training since the school festival.

80
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,790
Nice job, Uraraka.
You know Deku like the back of your hand.

81
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,580
I've only heard rumors about it, that's all!

82
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,659
Sorry!

83
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:56,909
Don't use your Quirk before the battle!

84
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:58,790
Save your strength for later!

85
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,750
I feel like I'm breakdancing!

86
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,870
Young Midoriya.

87
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,660
Has there been any anomaly
with your Quirks since then?

88
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,080
No, nothing in particular.

89
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,410
I see.

90
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,080
My mentor never told me anything
about the Quirks going berserk.

91
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,660
I'm going to find out more from Gran Torino.

92
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,870
OK, thank you very much.

93
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,120
You must be cautious.

94
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,540
The fifth battle is...

95
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:30,580
You saw One For All's real appearance
when you first fought Shinso.

96
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,870
HITOSHI SHINSO, QUIRK: BRAINWASH

97
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,370
Very well, I'll be careful.

98
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,450
KATSUKI BAKUGO, QUIRK: EXPLOSION

99
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,500
Kacchan, I didn't hear you coming.

100
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,200
If you want me to keep your secret,
then stop whispering behind me!

101
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,540
It'll only draw suspicion!

102
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,450
Oh...

103
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,040
Don't "oh"!

104
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,870
What's wrong with One For All?

105
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,830
The truth is...

106
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,659
Quirk trigger?

107
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,330
I'm not sure if you've improved
or the other way around!

108
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,660
I'm not sure either.

109
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,580
When will the Quirk truly become yours?

110
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:15,370
I'm much stronger now than we last fought.

111
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,750
I see...I can't wait to see.

112
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,500
Is Young Bakugo showing his concerns
in his own way?

113
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,910
What's with the smirk?

114
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:32,040
You're getting on my nerve!
Cut it out, you fool!

115
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,540
Or maybe I'm mistaken.

116
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:39,000
Young Midoriya saw the true face of One For All.

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,159
His fight with Shinso was the trigger.

118
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:46,450
I still think the two incidents are linked.

119
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:52,159
Mentor, and the previous holders,
what are you trying to convey?

120
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:56,450
"RECOVERY GIRL, QUIRK: HEAL"
Your injury

121
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:00,160
should heal in 30 minutes or so.

122
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,790
Be grateful that your body
is still young and strong.

123
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,830
You have really soft and delicate skin.

124
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,620
For the third battle,

125
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:16,080
the arena will be changed to
the east side of 2nd Street.

126
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,910
Let's proceed to the next battle!

127
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,870
Third battle, get ready!

128
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,910
3RD BATTLE

129
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,700
It's finally Ida's turn.

130
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:31,080
Todoroki has fire and ice
for a wide-range attack.

131
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,790
Ida has overwhelming speed.

132
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,159
Shoji has his sharp senses.

133
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,830
Ojiro is skilled in close-quarter combat.

134
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,250
This team is well-balanced in all aspects.

135
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,290
Todoroki is in this team.
That should make the fight a lot easier.

136
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,450
Underestimating your foe
will bring you to defeat.

137
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,330
I know that!

138
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,370
SHOTO TODOROKI, QUIRK: HALF COLD HALF HOT

139
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,580
Todoroki.

140
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:53,040
Tokoyami, how is your throat?

141
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,370
I took some medicine.

142
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,750
I'm feeling well.

143
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,159
I see.

144
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:00,540
I'm sorry you had to see my humiliating defeat.

145
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,250
I'm counting on you next.

146
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,040
Why me?

147
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,450
Hawks and Endeavor

148
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:11,540
were both in that fierce battle with Nomu,
and they are both our mentors.

149
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,160
We must live up to the expectation
of the No.1 and No.2 Heroes.

150
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,250
I see...

151
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,290
That last battle...

152
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,910
Plus Ultra!

153
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:29,160
Prominence Burn!

154
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,580
Shoto.

155
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,370
You must master this move.

156
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,080
Do not run away from me or yourself!

157
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,290
Stand up! Don't show any weakness!

158
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,870
It's a shame Toya didn't cut it.

159
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,620
His flame surpasses even mine.

160
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,250
But his body couldn't handle the cold.

161
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,830
It's such a shame.

162
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,160
You're my last hope, Shoto!

163
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,200
It's finally your turn!

164
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,750
Only you can master this move!

165
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,330
Only you can realize my ambition!

166
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,040
Todoroki...

167
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,500
Are you all right?
You seem odd just now.

168
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,120
Really?

169
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,000
Is something bothering you?

170
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,910
It's nothing. Thank you for asking.

171
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:30,370
You barely show any expression,
so it was hard to tell.

172
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,830
I'm impressed you actually noticed.

173
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:37,330
As the class rep, I must pay attention
to everyone and offer them my help!

174
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:40,040
He seems hyped somehow.
But he's always excited about something.

175
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,500
My brother is recovering well.

176
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,910
I'm glad to hear that.

177
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,330
I think Pro Hero Ingenium...

178
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,950
might have to retire from now on.

179
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,160
No!

180
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,290
People still need your leadership and guidance!

181
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:03,410
If you are willing,

182
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,080
could you please take on my hero name?

183
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,410
I must live up to the name

184
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,290
of my brother, the previous Ingenium!

185
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,700
As I'm watching everyone,
they are watching me as well.

186
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,000
I was in third place during the sports day.

187
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,790
I'll show everyone

188
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,000
my determination as the heir of his name!

189
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,540
Determination of an heir...

190
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,950
I know people see me as an oaf.

191
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,290
But at least I made it into U.A. High.

192
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:46,410
I'm not living on an empty brain!

193
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,750
Why are you bringing this up now?

194
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,410
It's about our team!

195
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,870
We don't know how to utilize
the element of surprise to our advantage!

196
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,040
That is true enough.

197
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,370
What should we do then?

198
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,540
Everyone!

199
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,040
We talked about this just now.

200
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,790
That's for sure!

201
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,870
Huh?

202
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,120
We'll raze this place to the ground!

203
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,620
That's what a fool would do!

204
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,040
Vlad King just told us to minimize the damage!

205
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:17,870
What? He wasn't even listening just now.

206
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,200
What is that?

207
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,120
I can hear the constant hitting of metals.

208
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,540
That is likely...

209
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,620
Tetsutetsu's doing.

210
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,790
Class B, Tetsutetsu Tetsutetsu.

211
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,910
Hero name: Real Steel.

212
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,450
Quirk: Steel.

213
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,080
He can turn his entire body into metal.

214
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,410
He can be the strongest weapon
and the toughest shield.

215
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,750
No more petty tricks.

216
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,540
Come on and face me head-on!

217
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,660
Tetsutetsu, they have Todoroki on their team!

218
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,700
I don't care!

219
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,290
You really are living on an empty brain.

220
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,370
Forget it. This is not entirely a bad thing.

221
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,500
Juzo, how you can you be so calm?

222
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,580
Geez! Don't keep us in the dark like that!

223
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,410
See? Pony is speaking in her mother tongue!

224
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,790
She is really upset!

225
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,080
Tetsutetsu doesn't mean any harm.

226
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,250
In fact, his approach plays to our strength.

227
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,370
Juzo, your approach is too gentle!

228
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,000
Bring it on!

229
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,830
The sound of metals is not stopping.

230
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:23,620
Judging by the noises, he is destroying
the surrounding.

231
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,000
They are planning a frontal assault.

232
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,540
Are they serious?

233
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,580
In that case, we must retaliate.

234
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,120
Agreed.

235
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,500
Great.

236
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,700
Let's go, Class A.

237
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,410
Team Three!

238
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
TENYA IDA, QUIRK: ENGINE

239
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
ENGINES ON HIS LEGS ALLOW HIM
TO MOVE AROUND SWIFTLY

240
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
AFFILIATION: U.A. HIGH

241
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
BIRTHDAY: AUGUST 22, HEIGHT: 179CM
BLOOD TYPE: A, FAVORITE FOOD: BEEF STEW

242
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
MASHIRAO OJIRO, QUIRK: TAIL

243
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
HE CAN USE HIS TAIL FOR ATTACKS
OR MOBILITY

244
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
AFFILIATION: U.A. HIGH, BIRTHDAY MAY 28,
HEIGHT 169CM

245
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
BLOOD TYPE: O, FAVORITE: MARTIAL ARTS

246
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,330
The villain is headed toward Line No.5.

247
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,790
The villain is headed to the port as expected.

248
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,410
I have to escape them.

249
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,580
Huh? Endeavor!

250
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,250
You're not getting away.

251
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,790
I'll use them as my hostage.

252
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,750
Run! Now!

253
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,250
Curse you! Let me go!

254
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,660
"ENDEAVOR, QUIRK: HELLFLAME"
That is not possible.

255
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,620
Fine, I get it! Let me go!
I'll do as you say!

256
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,160
Thank you, Endeavor.

257
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,700
How is the damage to the street?

258
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,330
There is barely any damage.

259
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:55,580
It was right to isolate him from the crowd.

260
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,000
Indeed.

261
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,500
So...

262
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,450
What is it?

263
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,790
Thank you!

264
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,750
You saved us!

265
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,450
Are you hurt?

266
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,120
No!

267
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,580
Stay safe on your way home.

268
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,620
OK!

269
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,790
Endeavor, there is another request to team-up.

270
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,870
Should we do the usual?

271
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:24,290
Yes. Make a list of the requests.

272
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,000
Thanks to Fuyumi,

273
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,750
I can finally...

274
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,750
add Shoto's number to my contact list!

275
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:38,370
Shoto, I have a message for you.

276
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,620
ARE YOU AVAILABLE? WAITING FOR YOUR REPLY
HOW ARE YOU? I NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOU.

277
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,200
Start replying my messages, Shoto!

278
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,120
I'm not the same guy
who used to ignore your feelings.

279
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:51,700
Do not run away from me or yourself!

280
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,750
Stand up!

281
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,660
Don't' show any weakness!

282
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:02,000
I've moved toward my own goal.

283
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,660
I believe I can teach you that move
as your father.

284
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,080
Which is why...

285
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,450
Which is why you should
start replying my messages.

286
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,660
Shoto!

287
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,870
I think he is in class right now.

288
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,200
His obsession with Shoto
is getting worse every day.

289
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,080
Are you all right?
Did you catch a cold?

290
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,830
It's nothing, I'll be fine.

291
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,040
We're almost there.

292
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,200
Follow the plan. Let's split up.

293
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,330
Understood.

294
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,790
We're counting on you, Todoroki.

295
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,290
Tetsutetsu!

296
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,250
Our opponents won't be stupid enough
to charge right at us!

297
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,830
This must be their trap!

298
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:47,910
No, I would come here if I were them.

299
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:53,000
After Shoji read the situation,
Todoroki will be their main force.

300
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,950
If they are all in this open area...

301
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,950
He always starts with his ice attack!

302
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:06,910
That is too sneaky!

303
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:10,870
But the ice won't block their view,
he's made some improvements.

304
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,790
Todoroki is behind the ice!
Where are the rest of them?

305
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,870
I can't see them.

306
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:19,370
Even if Honenuki makes the ground soft,

307
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,790
it won't matter as long as there is ice!

308
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:26,700
As soon as they slow down,
we'll take them all out.

309
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,160
Recipro Burst!

310
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,910
Bring it on!

311
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,580
What?

312
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,410
Using large-scale ice attack is too predictable.

313
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:48,080
We would be doomed
had you used your flame instead.

314
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,080
Class B, Juzo Honenuki.

315
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,870
Hero name: Mudman.

316
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,410
Quirk: Softening.

317
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,540
He can turn any object he touches soft.

318
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,080
But it doesn't work on creatures.

319
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,580
A second touch will undo the effect.

320
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,160
Thank you, Juzo!

321
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,120
Your reaction was flexible indeed!

322
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,200
He got in through official recommendations too!

323
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,410
He activated his Quirk before
the ice pinned them down.

324
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:12,660
His response was incredible.

325
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,619
We should retreat and regroup...

326
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:16,000
I found you.

327
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,660
I softened random objects in the area,
don't let your guard down.

328
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:26,369
Class B countered
Todoroki's ice attack flawlessly!

329
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:28,290
Now, retaliate!

330
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,040
Honenuki foresaw the ice attack?

331
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,330
Even so, he merely improvised.

332
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:37,040
"RIKIDO SATOU, QUIRK: SUGAR RUSH"
Honenuki is very intelligent.

333
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,660
"HANTA SERO, QUIRK: TAPE"
His flexibility is formidable.

334
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,870
Nice job, Juzo!
Leave Ojiro to me!

335
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,450
That hurts!

336
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,580
I can't guard against this attack!

337
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,120
Class B, Sen Kaibara.

338
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,580
Hero name: Spiral.

339
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,040
Quirk: Gyrate.

340
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,290
His body can spin like a drill!

341
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,410
Ojiro!

342
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,700
Not again!

343
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,040
Your legs can only run on hard surfaces.

344
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,950
The ice you stepped on was soft.

345
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,080
I knew you would be a threat.

346
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,790
I'll sink you and trap you in there.

347
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,870
You plan to stop our coordinated attack.

348
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:20,750
Cursed villain! How treacherous!

349
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,000
He's really into his role-playing.

350
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,290
They dealt with Ida's mobility.

351
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,950
Class B has no scouting member,

352
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:32,250
but they won't be at a disadvantage
as long as all combatants are in the vicinity.

353
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:36,330
If it turns into a battle royale,
Todoroki's efficiency will be greatly reduced.

354
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:40,200
Indeed. Now they simply have to
see it through the end.

355
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,660
Under these circumstances,

356
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:47,040
I can't use my flame or ice freely.

357
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,500
Should I go to the front-line?

358
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,500
But then I wouldn't be able to guard Shoji.

359
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,160
Shoji!

360
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:59,540
They thought Shoji would be hiding
in a safe spot and act as a scout.

361
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,120
I bet it's safe to hide behind Todoroki!

362
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,200
Class B, Pony Tsunotori.

363
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,000
Quirk: Horn Canon.

364
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,830
She can shoot her horns as projectiles.

365
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:12,580
She can currently control four horns at once.

366
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,370
She always makes sure
to keep her horns polished!

367
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:18,160
This is surprisingly powerful!

368
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,580
Tetsutetsu!

369
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,620
Here I come!

370
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,830
Horn Dash Hammer!

371
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:30,830
You sure are freezing cold, you jerk!

372
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:34,450
I can barely feel my metal, Todoroki!

373
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,450
But can you win a fight

374
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,250
if you have to fight me with bare hands?

375
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,580
Eat this!

376
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,330
"EIJIRO KIRISHIMA, QUIRK: HARDENING"
Tetsutetsu,

377
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:46,330
he learned from my mistake so quickly.

378
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,660
No, I don't think that was his intention.

379
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,500
Honenuki created this advantage for them.

380
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,660
Can you do nothing except dodging?

381
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,620
Stay there and stay still.

382
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,910
Curse it.

383
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,910
Sorry.

384
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,870
There is a time limit to your Recipro Burst.

385
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,290
Using it at the start wasn't a great idea.

386
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,910
I have to aid Tetsutetsu.

387
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,250
A time limit?

388
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,540
That was a long time ago, Mudman.

389
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,370
Ingenium will never be absent from a fight.

390
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,700
My legs exist for that sole purpose!

391
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,620
Right now,

392
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm always going full-throttle!

393
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:38,000
New Style: Recipro Turbo!

394
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,750
Are you kidding me?

395
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,870
Tenya, congratulations on getting
your provisional license.

396
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,580
Thank you, Brother.

397
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,330
Aren't you working your engines too hard?

398
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,660
By the way, Mom,

399
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,870
he's grown a lot.

400
00:20:55,870 --> 00:21:00,000
I know, but I think it's still too soon.

401
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,120
Tuning my engines?

402
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:08,330
Yes, you must start
training without your mufflers.

403
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:12,160
Then you'll be able to grow mufflers
with greater tolerance.

404
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,080
It's a technique passed down by our grandfather

405
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,620
so we can make it in time
to anyone that needs our help.

406
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,200
Removing the mufflers

407
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,330
will bring you great pain.

408
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:30,250
But to obtain greater speed...

409
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:35,500
This increases the base horsepower of Recipro.

410
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,330
The fuel depletion is minimized.

411
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,040
Ten minutes.

412
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,620
Within the next ten minutes

413
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,200

Next episode!

434
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:27,410
Honenuki's flexible reaction
put Class A in a disadvantage.

435
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:31,910
Ida's Recipro Turbo is now the deciding factor
of this battle.

436
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,750
That and Todoroki's left side.

437
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,790
Ignite your flame, Todoroki!

438
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:41,620
Unleash your true potential
and become what you strive to become!

The battle ends heroically.
