1
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,160
I know!

2
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,120
I broke out in a cold sweat...

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,580
when Nomu struck him down.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,500
I'm bored.

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,870
Is there no stronger hero around here?

6
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,950
You're too slow!

7
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,370
Did you regenerate...

8
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,410
and heal yourself?

9
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,040
We're not on the same level.

10
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,950
I can't move my body anymore.

11
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,750
If I can't move my body,

12
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,370
I'll move forward with the thrust of my flame!

13
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,160
My feathers aren't strong enough
to cause any real damage.

14
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,370
But I can still catch up with his speed.

15
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:24,120
I should send the feathers in first.

16
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,539
Your overwhelming firepower...

17
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:31,700
along with my speed...

18
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:35,950
Allow me to give you a final push,

19
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,450
Number One!

20
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,660
Artificial human...

21
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,700
You're...

22
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,539
me,

23
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:56,410
my past,

24
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,289
or even other self from another future.

25
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,500
With this inferno,

26
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,040
I send you into endless slumber!

27
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,500
Plus Ultra!

28
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,700
Prominence Burn!

29
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,200
He ended the battle
with his imposing victory pose.

30
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,620
That was so awesome.

31
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,620
The No.1 Hero never ceases to amaze us.

32
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,450
Hawks was amazing too.

33
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,160
Not to mention he's so handsome!

34
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,410
The man who's a bit too fast
lives up to his name.

35
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,910
Todoroki-kun.

36
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,750
How is Endeavor?

37
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,950
He is no longer in critical condition.

38
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,910
I see. I'm glad to hear that.

39
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,620
He's a father you can be proud of, Todoroki!

40
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,790
Yes, you're right.

41
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,750
The lesson started...

42
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,040
SILENCE

43
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,410
Good.

44
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,829
Don't get excited over everything.

45
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:28,500
It's time to take initiative.

46
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,040
I know it's only the provisional license,

47
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,620
but you can participate in heroes' activities
and must carry out the respective duties.

48
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,700
Keep that in mind.

49
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,079
So far, there are still two of you...

50
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:44,410
who are still taking
the provisional license training course.

51
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,290
The lessons from now on
will only get more challenging.

52
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,200
You should get ready.

53
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,620
Now, we proceed to our homeroom.

54
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,079
Emergency training! Emergency training!

55
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,370
In case of a hostile invasion into U.A. High,

56
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,790
Hero Class 1-A is requested to deploy.

57
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,870
Please change into your battle suits.

58
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,620
Head to the battle as fast as you can.

59
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,040
Hero Class 1-A,

60
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,250
deploy!

61
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,750
Yes!

62
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,910
Around 80% of the total population...

63
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,950
are born with special abilities,

64
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,330
"QUIRK"
forming a society of superhumans.

65
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,000
To defend the world from
criminals possessing special abilities,

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,580
Pro Heroes have now risen as the new profession.

67
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,950
HERO

68
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,500
I am Izuku Midoriya.

69
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,000
I enrolled in the prestigious U.A. High...

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,040
to realize my dream of becoming a real hero.

71
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:54,580
I'm moving towards my goal...

72
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,659
along with my comrades who share the same dream.

73
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,080
We face the dangers of this world...

74
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,870
and save its people with smile on our faces.

75
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,290
This is what it takes
to become the greatest heroes.

76
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,660
Yes, this is...

77
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,830
My Hero Academia.

78
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,950
EVERYONE, DISPATCH! CLASS 1-A!

79
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,620
Enemies have infiltrated Ground Beta.

80
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,750
That's all we know for now.

81
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,250
Whether this is training,

82
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,370
we must complete our mission flawlessly.

83
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:07,040
We need more information on the situation.

84
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,160
Scout division, I am counting on you.

85
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,410
Leave it to us.

86
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,870
Birds in this area,

87
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,950

have been damaged.

I can hear noises of destruction.

96
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,159
Smoke has been spotted in the area...

97
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,500

It's burning.

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,160
I can't confirm the presence

105

Bad news.

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,450
Someone has been washed away by the river.

120
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,830
What?

121
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,700
It's our turn to shine, Grape Juice.

122
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,290

What now?

131
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,830
I'll search for the villains.

132
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,830
Those morons can handle the rescue mission.

133
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,500
Shoto-kun, give me a hand.

134

We missed it...

141
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,790
Froppy, how is the rescue?

142
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,160
We found the civilian.

143
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,330
Where is it, Froppy?

144
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,540
Over there.

145
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,870
I somehow got washed away by the river.

146
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,830
Isn't that Togata-senpai?

147
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,000
Why is he here?

148
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,160
I thought he dropped out.

149
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,870
What have I got myself into?
This can't be good.

173
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,950
Have you detected any hostile activity?

174
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,500
No, we've got nothing so far.

175
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,580
Understood. Please continue...

176
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,000
Did I miss a spot somehow?

177
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,500
The smoke is rising again.

178
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,870
It's worse than before.

179
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:26,040
At this rate, the fire will start to spread.

180
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,000
So we must stop it from ever happening.

181
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,950
Yes.

182
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,450
Use the plan we discussed.

183
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,000

184
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,040

Good, we stopped the fire from spreading.

203
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,620
I must freeze it for good!

204
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,660
The fire has been subdued.

205
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,120
-I'm glad we made it.
-Quiet.

206
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,160
I hear some unsettling noises.

207
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,120
Watch out! Something is coming this way!

208
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,080
Could it be...

209
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,950
Did you forget about me?

210
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,200
The villain is still around.

211
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,410
Are you aware of that?

212
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,080
Hado-senpai is our enemy?

213
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,580
There's another one!

214
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,200
There's another villain!

215
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,370
It's Amajiki-senpai!

216
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,620
Why am I playing the villain?

217
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,080
Everyone is staring at me.

218
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,870
Yes, they are nothing but potatoes.

219
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:30,080
They are not watching me, they are vegetables.

220
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,950
I want to go home.

221
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,000
He is leaving already?

Amajiki-senpai is really leaving.

231
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,040
Is it really all right for him to leave?

232
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,330
Stop, Amajiki-kun!

233
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:59,330
You can't go, you must play your role.

234
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,410
Stay still, or you might get hurt.

235
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:05,620
After all, I'm villain now.

236
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,750
The Big Three are the villains...

237
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,000
They have Pinky as hostage.

238
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,500
We can flank them from behind.

239
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,330
Let's go.

240
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,830
I told you to stay still, didn't you hear me?

241
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,370
Bad children should be punished!

242
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,660
That's...

243
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,410
Charge complete, 30% output.

244
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,660
I'm being washed away, again.

245
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,200
We must save him.

246
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,700
I bet he did it on purpose!

247
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,580
Ingenium.

248
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,000
The rescue mission is our priority.

249
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,370
Leave Hado-senpai to Midoriya and the others.

250
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,250
We must rescue the civilians.

251
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,450
Understood.

252
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,200
The sounds are too distorted
to make anything out of them.

253
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,700
What is going on?

254
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,750
Pinky is being held hostage.

255
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,700
What?

256
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,370
We must save her.

257
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,330
No.

258
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,580
Our mission is to remain here and
investigate the situation.

259
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:26,500
There are more than just two villains
in the vicinity.

260
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,830
Villains, what is your motive?

261
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,410
I want to go home!

262
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,580
Go ahead.

263
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,830
But if I did that, Hado will be mad at me.

264
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,660
Mirio said...

265
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:52,330
he would do everything he can
to hone your skills...

266
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,870
so you could become real heroes.

267
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,620
So I can't leave just yet!

268
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:03,000
The Big Three are doing this for us.

269
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,540
I appreciate their effort,

270
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,580
but this is too challenging!

271
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,000
Someone is missing.

272
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,830
Where is that invisible girl?

273
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:14,950

274
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,620

I get it now. It's Hagakure!

Please surrender.

Why didn't you strike me down?

295
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,250
I couldn't do it.

296
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,910
Your naivety could cost you your life.

297

As of now,

The charging is too slow, fool.

That's awesome, Bakugo.

He took down Amajiki-senpai.

319

You saved me again, thanks.

Training complete. Training complete.

326
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,750
So the battle is over.

327
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,790
I think so.

328
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,120
Not so fast!

329
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,910
You were pulling punches!

330
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,700
But the look on your face...

331
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,910
Don't you dare look down on me!

332
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,830
I don't care if this is a training.

333

I don't care if you are my senior!

A villain is a villain nonetheless!

335
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,040
You are my enemy!

336
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,450
I should have gone home.

337
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,830
Now die!

338
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,200
I want Bakugo in my office.

341
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:00,080
the Hero Academia...

342
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,410
We'll become the greatest heroes!

343
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,790
Your pose was just like All Might.

344
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,790
I used a different arm.

345
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,250
He raises his left arm.

346
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,040
How should I know that?

347
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,290
Either the way,

348
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:21,160
thank you for winning this battle.

349
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,830
I failed miserably.

350
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:27,660
I performed so badly at the beginning.

351
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,250
Sorry.

352
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,000
But this victory we secured...

353
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,160
must be meaningful!

354
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:38,120
Hold on a moment.

355
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,580
We had some dramatic turn of events.

356
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,700
But anyway...

357
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,000
we finally meet,

358
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,450
Endeavor.

359
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:11,500
Hi...what took you so long?

360
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,540
NEXT EPISODE

361
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,750
In his battle against Nomu,

362
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:29,580
the No.1 Hero Endeavor managed
to come out on top.

363
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,620
However, underneath it all...

364
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:35,250
are the League of Villains
which is operating covertly, and Hawks.

365
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,790
On the other hand, some kind of mutation
is taking place inside my body.

366
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:43,450
Next, "Vestiges".

367
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:46,910
I'll uncover the secrets of One For All...

368
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:50,040
"VESTIGES"
and All For One.
