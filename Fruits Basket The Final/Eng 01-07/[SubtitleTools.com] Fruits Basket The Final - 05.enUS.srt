Hmm? Oh. I was just thinking it might
be nice to take a trip somewhere.

--He's all grown up!

when they see me.

63

and you're even more handsome now!

Great!

You know, I'm happy I got taller.

68
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,710
Don't get me wrong--being little was fun.

69
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:23,460
Plus, I could do stuff or get away with
stuff that I couldn't have otherwise...

70
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:28,640
But I'm a man, too, you know?

75
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,030
Anyone would take them
for a doting couple.

Oh, Hatsuharu-san!

I'm so happy about Isuzu-san.

Oh, um, I just told Honda-san that
you found out her hospital address.

79
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,760
Ah, yeah. Thanks.

80
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,720
Me and Tohru are
on our way to get ice cream--

81
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,300
Hey! Let's buy a bunch and eat it
together at Shii-chan's house!

82
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,930
That sounds great!

83
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,020
Okay, then let's get
an ice cream cake, too!

84
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,230
An ice cream cake...?!

85
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,030
I guess she's never had one.

86
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:29,450
And it's definitely been classified
as a luxury item in her brain.

87
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:34,370
Uh... um!

88
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,160
Good... Good aft...!

89
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,460
Hey, you.

90
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,710
Could you stop intimidating Kisa?

91
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,290
I'm not intimidating her!

92
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,170
Where'd you even come from?!

93
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,500
I was in the bathroom.

94
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,590
Well, anybody who came home
to her just sitting there

95
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,340
--would wonder what was going on!
--U-Um!

96
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,390
--That's the issue here?
--U-Um!

97
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,930
You should be nice to younger--

98
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,520
Eh, whatever. When's she coming home?

99
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,650
What's with that
"I'll let you win" attitude?

100
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,020
--U-Um!
--Anyway, did you two just barge in here?

101
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,030
Excuse me? Assuming we're
that rude makes you the ru--

102
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,990
Big Brother Shigure
was just leaving when we got here.

103
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,120
He said he was visiting the main estate.

104
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,200
Your attitude is pissing me off
more than the insults would.

105
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,040
Um!

106
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,410
Um!

107
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,250
G-Good afternoon!

108
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,750
Yeah. Good afternoon.

109
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,090
Well, she'll probably be home soon.

110
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,510
Hiro-chan!

111
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,220
I said hello!

112
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,180
Yeah, I saw.

113
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,640
He really is nice deep down, huh?

114
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,900
It seems like he's always nice
to Big Sister, after all.

115
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,820
Yeah...

116
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:54,820
Did you pick on Akito again today?
Don't you get tired of that?

117
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,830
Sheesh, why are you so mean?

118
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,870
I can't believe those are your
first words when you show up.

119
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,080
This is my house.

120
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,420
And it seems to me she gets more
withdrawn every time you visit her.

121
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,420
No way, really?!
Doesn't that seem, like, really bad?!

122
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:15,220
Knowing I'm the same age he is
makes me truly sad sometimes.

123
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,890
You're too old to be such a brat.

124
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,560
Akito is only digging in her heels

125
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,270
because you refuse to let on
what you're thinking.

126
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,900
Oh!

127
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,770
I'm doing that on purpose, though.

128
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,490
Yes, I'm aware.

129
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:36,240
How about you stop having a battle
of wills with someone younger than you?

130
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,540
Even to me, it sometimes looks
like you truly hate her.

131
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:46,000
Why not be a little nicer?

132
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,800
You say that,

133
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,590
but "kindness" from me is
a hastily manufactured afterthought.

134
00:08:55,590 --> 00:09:00,140
It's not as good as
the real thing that you have.

135
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:07,060
For some reason I don't find it sad,
but I wonder why...

136
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:12,440
Like, I've never particularly
wanted a parent's love,

137
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:18,990
and frankly, it doesn't really
bother me that I'm possessed...

138
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:27,080
If this is what you call being
"twisted," then I must be twisted.

139
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,130
And the fact is,
I can't even find that sad...

140
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:36,420
Maybe that makes me very alone.

141
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:42,810
Maybe a person like me really
should have dreamed of...

142
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,900
But anyway, yeah! I'm not a nice person,
so it's a wash. You know?

143
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,690
You're going to give up
without trying, eh?

144
00:09:54,070 --> 00:10:01,070
A generous kindness like yours, or a
detached kindness like Kureno-kun's...

145
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:07,120
Even assuming Akito wants that from me,
it's not going to happen.

146
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,880
I'm not looking to become her father.

147
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:20,470
We've got a crowd here.
What should we do for dinner?

148
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,930
Let's have a barbecue!

149
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,100
--Barbecue! Barbecue!

150
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,720
--Hiro, you two should call ahead
instead of just coming over.
--Barbecue! Barbecue!

151
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,600
--Hiro, you two should call ahead
instead of just coming over.

152
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,980
I do feel a little bad about that, but...

153
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,650
--If the person forced to make
dinner for us is fine with it,

154
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,150
--Kisa-san!
--If the person forced to make
dinner for us is fine with it,

155
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,690
--If the person forced to make
dinner for us is fine with it,

156
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,360
I figure it's fine.

157
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,780
Hello, Honda-san?

158
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,910
Y-Yes, how may I help you?!

159
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,030
Welcome home.

160
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,240
Let's have a barbecue!

161
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,120
I can't imagine this house has
the equipment for barbecuing.

162
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,710
We're fine without equipment.

163
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,250
No, we're not.

164
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:57,170
But all we need is a fire
that can grill the meat, right?

165
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,880
Yeah.

166
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,180
Should burn well.

167
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,640
--What are you planning?!
--What are you planning?!

168
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,260
It's what's for dinner.

169
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,890
Real food...

170
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,020
We'll get nowhere at this rate.

171
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,930
Let's go with curry.

172
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,190
Say, where is Kyo-kun?

173
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,150
He was here before,
so I think he's in his room.

174
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:18,030
Okay, I'll go get him!

175
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,320
You guys are gonna eat here, too?

176
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,620
It's okay, we settled on curry.

177
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,450
Whatever. You grew a lot, huh?

178
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:33,250
Right? Pretty soon, I might be
taller than you, and better-looking!

179
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,630
And then, and then...

180
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:41,130
Maybe Tohru will accept my proposal?

181
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:50,270
Do you get that if you give up,
something like that might happen?

182
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,480
So you shouldn't give up.

183
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:01,900
I'm gonna stop going "There's no point
in thinking about this," and giving up.

184
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:07,410
Wouldn't it sting if some
other guy took Tohru from you?

185
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,830
Well, look at the time!
We better go help make curry!

186
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,540
Come on!

187
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:24,470
It's a really strange feeling to come home
and see a soup kitchen in my yard.

188
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,430
--Welcome home!
--Welcome home!

189
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:29,560
Hello, children! Papa's home!

190
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,770
Yuki-nii, what's his deal?

191
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,850
He's just an idiot. Don't worry about it.

192
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:38,610
Shigure-san, if you haven't
eaten yet tonight, would...

193
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,690
Hi, Tohru-kun. How are you? Working hard?

194
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:46,240
Um, yes, I'm...

195
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:52,790
Maybe I really should have dreamed of you.

196
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,870
What?

197
00:12:53,870 --> 00:13:00,250
Maybe a person like me
needs someone like you most...

198
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,510
...the author finds himself thinking.

199
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,260
Shigure-san?

200
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,560
I'm just playing what-ifs.

201
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,850
Right, I'll take a medium-large serving!

202
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,230
A-All right!

203
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,940
Tohru! Let's eat the ice cream now!

204
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,650
--All right!
--Time will begin marching on.

205
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:28,570
As will people and emotions.

206
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:33,660
So I want you to come soon, too.

207
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:41,920
Once upon a time, God told the animals:

208
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,300
"I invite you to the banquet
I shall hold tomorrow."

209
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:52,430
God in this story was you, Akito.

210
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:56,180
A special child... the chosen child.

211
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,940
Born to be loved.

212
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,900
There is no loneliness
or fear in your future.

213
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:08,280
There are only unchanging bonds.

214
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,490
You have been promised eternity.

215
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,160
No one will ever leave you--

216
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,580
Hatsuharu...

217
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,500
Don't go, Hatsuharu!

218
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,830
Hatsuharu!

219
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,580
Hatsuharu!

220
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,430
Momiji...

221
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,470
Oh.

222
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:40,940
The end comes so suddenly...

223
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,650
Momiji...

224
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,360
Momiji.

225
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,990
Don't go.

226
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,530
Please.

227
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:56,240
Don't go away and leave me!

228
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,290
What was that?

229
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:04,670
What were all those feelings
watching me like guards

230
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:09,130
from some corner of my heart?

231
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:14,600
What about this person
could possibly tie me down?

232
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,390
Mo...

233
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:22,150
This person is so small,
and weak, and pitiful...

234
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,400
Momiji...

235
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,480
No. No, stop!

236
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,570
Those eyes... Don't look at me like that!

237
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,120
Don't...

238
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,620
You should go back to your room.

239
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,750
I'm sure you don't feel well.

240
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:45,080
You don't have to worry.
I won't tell anyone about this.

241
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:50,420
Go home. At least for tonight.

242
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:54,800
I'm a little confused right now, too.

243
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,640
I'll come talk to you tomorrow.

244
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,150
Hey. Have you seen Momiji today?

245
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,530
Huh? I haven't seen him.

246
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,190
Why, wasn't he in class?

247
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:14,950
He was. He came late, though.

248
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,740
Did something happen?

249
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:21,290
Nothing. But it's like...

250
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:24,170
Something's weird.

251
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:26,790
He's the same as always,

252
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:31,380
but something, somewhere, is different...

253
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,920
Good afternoon!

254
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,090
Honda-san.

255
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,220
Honda-san, have you seen Momiji?

256
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,930
Hmm? No, not today.

257
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:42,100
Is something the matter?

258
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,060
I wonder what's the matter...

259
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,480
Wha-What?! Wh-What in the world happened?!

260
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,780
Haru, behave.

261
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:54,610
Honda-san, it's okay. He was just asking.

262
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:58,120
U-Um, okay...

263
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,580
Kyo-kun!

264
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,120
What're you standing around here for?

265
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,960
Kyo, have you seen Momiji?

266
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,630
Why, something up with him?

267
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,210
No, nothing.

268
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,880
Then why ask?

269
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,640
Momiji?

270
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,650
Jeez, you're here of all places.

271
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,190
Tohru and them are inside
looking for you, so--

272
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,530
What?

273
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:38,070
Huh? Uh, nothing.

274
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,120
Is something different about you?

275
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,200
"My curse is broken."

276
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,420
Would it surprise you if I said that?

277
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,630
What? Listen, you--

278
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:59,590
Yours breaking would make Tohru
happier than mine breaking.

279
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,760
I'm sure she'd be happy.

280
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,140
You realize, don't you?

281
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,900
I'm the one this stings.

282
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:18,200
Shut up.

283
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,950
I don't wanna realize that.

284
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,870
It's too...

285
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:29,670
I'm sorry I sent you home alone yesterday.

286
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:34,000
I spent the whole day thinking.

287
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,930
Wondering why my curse
is gone... only mine.

288
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:42,850
I couldn't think of anything
that would cause it.

289
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,100
But I can say this:

290
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:51,770
Akito, I can't stay by your side
for rest of my life.

291
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:56,820
And you can't tie me down anymore.

292
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,240
Monster.

293
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,910
Traitor. Traitor!

294
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:09,410
If you leave here, leave me,

295
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,540
you've got no place to go!

296
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:16,250
Your mother and father won't just
welcome you back! No one will!

297
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,170
You'll never be happy!

298
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,430
I know.

299
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:28,390
I've become so free, and so lonely.

300
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:33,690
The curse breaking doesn't mean
I'll get the girl I want.

301
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:40,030
And the bonds that unconditionally
connected me to everyone are gone.

302
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:47,700
It's too late. I can't go back
to before things were broken.

303
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,500
Good morning.

304
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,250
Momiji-kun, is that you?

305
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,210
Good morning. Is this
your usual school route?

306
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:04,510
No, I thought I'd walk
a different way today.

307
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,800
Oh, I see.

308
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,810
You've grown so tall, Momiji-kun.
I hardly recognized you.

309
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,230
Has your daughter grown, too?

310
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:18,110
No, she's still a little kid.

311
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:21,690
We're going on a family trip
for summer break,

312
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:24,110
and she already can't contain herself!

313
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,700
Wow.

314
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,160
What about you?

315
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,210
Will your family take a trip, too?

316
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,330
Someplace far away.

317
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:39,000
Their happiness,
in a place where I'm not.

318
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,380
But...

319
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:47,050
But don't tell me that not having
those things means I can't be happy!

320
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:51,520
Don't just decide that!

321
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,900
I feel vulnerable being free,
but a happiness might exist for me!

322
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:02,240
It might be somewhere in the future,
waiting for me to catch up!

323
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,070
Yeah.

324
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:10,410
There'll be a trip.

325
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:15,410
With the family that I can
probably have someday.

326
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:20,500
A trip to the future.
To the world in motion.

327
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,590
I'm going to finally start walking...

328
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,840
...along my own life's path.

329
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:36,600
What about you?
How long will you stay here?

330
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,190
The person most afraid that
if they leave this place,

331
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:45,490
they'll have no home and no happiness...

332
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,700
Shut up.

333
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,200
Just shut up.

334
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,870
Get lost.

335
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,210
Okay.

336
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,960
Okay, I'll be going now.

337
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,680
All right. See you later!

338
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,390
Take care!

339
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,400
Will do!

340
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:51,460
"It Was So Foolish"

341
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:50,820
It was so foolish.
