1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,310
Good for you.

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,070
You must be happy you're such
good friends that she worries about you.

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,150
Good for you.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:10,940
"Snap"

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,950
--Don't cry!
--Okay!

6
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,660
--I'm through with watching you
blubber like a wimp!
--She's happy. She's blushing. She's so happy.

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,990
--Haru.
--I'm through with watching you
blubber like a wimp! --She's happy. She's blushing. She's so happy.

8
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,040
I don't often hear you
shouting like that, Isuzu.

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,160
Shisho-san!

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,000
Did your friend's visit
put you in high spirits?

11
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,250
"Friend...?"

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,420
F-Friend...

13
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:30,590
They get along so well.

14
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,300
--Yep.
--But violence is still wrong!

15
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,090
Will she be recuperating here for a while?

16
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:41,390
Yes. She doesn't like the idea
of a hospital or the main estate.

17
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,350
She was locked up, wasn't she? By Akito.

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,280
She says she doesn't
want us to tell Honda-san.

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,990
And she's scared of having
anything more to do with Akito.

20
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,990
I don't want Akito
involved with her, either.

21
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,660
Okay.

22
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,700
By the way, Hatsuharu.

23
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,880
Where was Isuzu being held?

24
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,540
The Cat's place.

25
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,920
I see.

26
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,470
She was where Kyo is going.

27
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,020
"Fruits Basket"

28
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,860
I kinda think Shisho's just gonna
let Isuzu move in with him.

29
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,360
Don't worry, Kyo-kun,
you're his one and only!

30
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,570
He lives for you!

31
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,280
I'm not worried about it,
so no more weird phrasing!

32
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,040
Anyway, I figure it's a good thing.

33
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,170
The livelier his house,
the less lonely he'll get.

34
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,500
Honda-san?

35
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,880
Er, yes?

36
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,420
The anniversary of your
mom's death is coming up, right?

37
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,510
Can I come with you to the graveyard?

38
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,340
Yes, of course!

39
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,100
I'm going on Saturday morning with
Uo-chan and Hana-chan, so I'd love--

40
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,310
I... can't go with you.

41
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,810
Okay.

42
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,530
Bad luck for you, huh?

43
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,370
Not only did you not find
a way to break the curse,

44
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,780
I hear something
pretty bad happened to you.

45
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,290
Learn any lessons about recklessness?

46
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,670
Ren-san was going to tell me the way.

47
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,380
Yeah, about that...

48
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,380
She lied.

49
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,800
Ren-san doesn't know the way.

50
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,510
Smart money says she was using you
as a pawn in her feud with Akito-san.

51
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,260
And you just fell for it.

52
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,350
You're lying.

53
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,230
I won't tell you to trust me.

54
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:18,520
But I know Ren-san better
than you do. We're close.

55
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,990
Very close.

56
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,490
You know what?

57
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:31,160
The zodiac curse will break
on its own, eventually.

58
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,790
You don't have to work yourself
to death over it.

59
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,960
Those ties from ages past
are already fraying.

60
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,210
We'll be free eventually.

61
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:45,680
We're the generation
invited to the final banquet.

62
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,350
D-Don't just make stuff up!

63
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:52,890
When is "eventually"?

64
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:57,980
Is it years or decades from now?

65
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,190
That's not good enough.

66
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:06,320
It has to... It has to
break by next spring, or...

67
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,200
Kyo-kun will...!

68
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:14,790
Shigure-san, did you know
all along that it would break?

69
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,040
Nah, of course not.

70
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,800
But I did sense that
we might be at the end.

71
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,090
From what I hear,
this is the first time the whole zodiac

72
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,010
has been alive at once.

73
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:31,970
So the attendants were excited about it,
saying it was amazing.

74
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,980
But I thought something else:

75
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:41,070
"What if it's just that this is
the last banquet, so we're all attending?"

76
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,650
And then, what do you know,

77
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:46,200
Kureno-kun's curse broke without
him or anyone else even trying.

78
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,360
What?

79
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,280
--Wh-What does...
--I'll put it in kindergarten terms.

80
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,540
Kureno-kun isn't one of us anymore.

81
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,330
And he said it, too.

82
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,880
He thinks the end is near.

83
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:07,220
That tiny changes and catalysts build up,
and the whole thing moves.

84
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:11,550
Of course, as things stand,
Kyo-kun will still be locked up.

85
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,930
Yes, we know.

86
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:21,110
All of us know exactly what will
happen to him, in the very near future.

87
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:25,480
But we won't do or say anything.

88
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,860
Why not?

89
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,740
Why not?

90
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,030
Because that's the Cat's role.

91
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,580
We zodiac members are monsters.

92
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:41,080
But when we look at him, we can think...

93
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:46,420
"Thank god, at least I'm not him."

94
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:52,930
The Cat is a gift to us:
an Other creature for us to exclude.

95
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,970
And Kyo knows that--

96
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,720
Shigure-san!

97
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,190
Mad at me?

98
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,610
But that will end, too, eventually.

99
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,650
It's not that I believe
Kureno-kun's story without question.

100
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:13,120
But it matches what my gut tells me.

101
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,830
You said "eventually" isn't good enough.

102
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,870
Do you want to save Kyo?

103
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,000
Is Kyo your--

104
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,130
Is Kyo her...?

105
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:36,810
What is it that's most precious to you?

106
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,310
That question...

107
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:44,690
I should've answered "my mother"
without even thinking, but I couldn't.

108
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:48,150
What came to mind instead was...

109
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,700
Why?

110
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:56,080
I swore to myself so firmly that day...

111
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,790
Tohru-san, is there anything
else you need to pack?

112
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:05,040
I could feel her disappearing.

113
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,380
She'd been there so recently, but...

114
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:15,550
She was sitting there
and smiling like always, but...

115
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:19,010
...I could feel her slowly disappearing.

116
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,190
Let's go, Kyoko-san.

117
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:35,490
So I swore to myself that
I'd always put Mom first in my heart.

118
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:42,330
I believed that if I kept
loving her first, they'd never fade.

119
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:46,170
Not my memories, and not our promise.

120
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,290
"Always together."

121
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:54,800
Because if I didn't
believe in that, I'd collapse.

122
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,340
And yet...

123
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,180
This is so wrong, but...

124
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,180
She's going away... far, far away.

125
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,850
Tohru?

126
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,690
Why are you crying?

127
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,280
I...

128
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,070
I... don't know what to do!

129
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:24,330
At times like that,
you should just do nothing.

130
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:28,040
It's fine to wait till you think,
"I gotta do something," before you act.

131
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,920
Probably.

132
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,050
Until then, well...

133
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,590
Go on and cry.

134
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:44,310
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

135
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:50,360
I want to stay here just a little longer.

136
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:55,570
Because, eventually, I really will
have to do something...

137
00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:03,580
...and I think maybe I know what
I'll let go of when the time comes.

138
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,000
Oh, my!

139
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,460
You're that boy...

140
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:13,630
I remember your orange hair!

141
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,670
Tohru's grandpa?

142
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:20,090
That's right.
Kyoko-san... I mean, Tohru-san.

143
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:23,310
Tohru-san lives with you.

144
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,680
Why are you sitting here, Gramps?

145
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,110
Oh, it's nothing.
I just strained my back again.

146
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,070
What?! Are you okay?!

147
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,110
I'm just waiting for my ride.

148
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,120
"Honda Family"

149
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,620
Did you come to visit
Kyoko-san's grave, too?

150
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,080
Thank you.

151
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,500
Is Kyoko--I mean, is Tohru-san doing well?

152
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,460
Do you always call her "Kyoko"?

153
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,920
Hmm? Yes, I do.

154
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,470
Isn't that a little messed-up?

155
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,180
Yes, it is. But you see...

156
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,730
I wanted to keep her alive.

157
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:16,860
I wanted to show her proof that
Kyoko-san existed, in any way I could.

158
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:22,320
Because she looked ready
to break forever without that.

159
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:29,790
Do you know why Tohru-san
talks the way she does?

160
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,250
No, I don't...

161
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:40,970
Apparently, she's copying
Katsuya--that's her father.

162
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:47,560
During Katsuya's funeral, some
no-good relatives said no-good things.

163
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,270
"She doesn't look a bit like Katsuya."

164
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:53,310
"Are we sure she's his?"

165
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:58,480
And, "She'll be no comfort at all."

166
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,780
She was so young, maybe they thought
they could say what they wanted

167
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,870
and she wouldn't understand.

168
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:12,620
Idiots. Children absolutely
understand what adults say.

169
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,420
Playing hide-and-seek, Kagura?

170
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,960
Shh! Pretend I'm not here, please!

171
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,590
I hope I'm not intruding.

172
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,510
Hello, come in.

173
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,800
Have you come to see Isuzu?

174
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,560
Yes, I'm on my way home
from my graveyard... visit...

175
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,640
Please, sit down and enjoy yourself.

176
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,940
Well? Are you avoiding her
because you had a fight?

177
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,070
It's nothing that simple.

178
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:50,080
I don't know how to face her,
and I can't get over it yet.

179
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,960
I know it'll show on my face.
I know I'll feel like the loser.

180
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,170
--And what upsets me most
is recognizing that about myself!

181
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,590
--Yes, that does sound complicated.
--And what upsets me most
is recognizing that about myself!

182
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:06,840
If she'd just get together with
Kyo-kun already, I could stop wavering!

183
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,180
She does love Kyo?

184
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:12,600
Why wouldn't she?
That's not even a question!

185
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,770
And anyway, I know he loves her!

186
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:21,110
Shihan? Aren't you happy?

187
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,610
I'm worried, that's all.

188
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:29,490
I hope she loves Kyo for who he is.

189
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,580
That it's not just compassion or pity...

190
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,960
So. Why did you come today?

191
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:41,750
Well, er, last time, I rudely ran away,
and it's been several days...

192
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:45,550
I don't mind that. But why Kyo?

193
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:49,600
Of all people... He's the Cat, you know.

194
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,180
Do you pity him?

195
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:56,310
The previous Cat had
a companion, you know.

196
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,270
It was the woman in charge
of looking after him.

197
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:03,400
She conceived his child.
She was at his deathbed.

198
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:10,240
One day, someone asked her, "How were
you able to do so much for the Cat?"

199
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,620
Wouldn't you feel sorry
for the poor thing?

200
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,120
Perhaps that's a lovely sentiment.

201
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,500
And perhaps it was
much better for my grandfather

202
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,920
than spending his days alone.

203
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,460
And yet...

204
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:35,770
Can this cruel, greedy
feeling really be pity?

205
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:41,860
I mean, when I say I want to protect
or free the zodiac members...

206
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,280
Those are just excuses!

207
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,410
I'm hiding my true feelings
and tricking you...

208
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,910
I'm a coward.

209
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,660
I...

210
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,870
I put my mother first
in my heart, but now...

211
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:01,670
I just want Kyo-kun!

212
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:08,220
I just don't want the curse,
the Somas, or anyone else

213
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,140
to take Kyo-kun from me!

214
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,560
Because Kyo-kun is what's
most precious to me!

215
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:21,400
You tell stuff like that to him!

216
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,690
Tohru-san took it to heart.

217
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:32,450
Katsuya was dead, and anyone could see
Kyoko-san was wasting away.

218
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:38,750
Dad went someplace far away, right?
Is Mom going there, too?

219
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:44,380
She seems sick. She doesn't talk to me.

220
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:48,340
Is she sad because I don't look like Dad?

221
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:52,590
If I turn exactly like Dad,
will she get better?

222
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,050
Will she stay and not leave?

223
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:59,220
Later, there was an incident

224
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,730
where Kyoko-san was away
from home for a long time.

225
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,020
That's when it started.

226
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,360
That's when it started.

227
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,570
She copied Katsuya and...

228
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:16,580
She never finished that sentence,

229
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,790
but I finally know the end.

230
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,790
Just once, I looked in on her

231
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:29,550
because Kyoko was worried about
leaving her alone all night for work.

232
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:34,840
The Tohru I saw that night,
sitting all alone...

233
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,600
If that's who Tohru really is...

234
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,520
I remember.

235
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,770
She was so lonely.

236
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:50,150
I-I didn't think you were home!

237
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:53,490
Yeah. You came home early too, huh?

238
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:57,910
Yes, I heard that
it would rain this evening.

239
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:02,620
But it looks like I worried for nothing!

240
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,420
Hey.

241
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,080
What did your dad look like?

242
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:13,300
You told me you didn't remember
too clearly, but do you look alike?

243
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:20,470
W-Well, not our faces...

244
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:26,850
B-But, um, people say my polite
way of speaking is a lot like his!

245
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:32,740
Even Mom said it was... very similar...

246
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,820
Oh.

247
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,660
That probably made her happy.

248
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:48,330
I... lied. I'm not like him at all.

249
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:53,260
I'm just copying him,
because I'm not like him.

250
00:17:53,260 --> 00:18:02,060
Th-The truth is... I thought of
my dad as a bad guy.

251
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:09,480
Even though I remember his kindness,
and the things he gave me.

252
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:15,240
I really do remember them, but...

253
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,570
But...

254
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:22,700
...I thought he might
take Mom away with him.

255
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:29,750
So I wanted to make her notice me,
and stay with me...

256
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,920
I wanted to keep her alive.

257
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:37,170
I didn't want her to leave me behind.

258
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:43,180
I'd do anything to feel safe, because...

259
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:48,730
I just made my dad a bad guy, because...

260
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:53,900
I'd let go of any promise out of
my own selfishness, because...

261
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,110
...I'm awful.

262
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:03,160
It was so foolish.

263
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,580
She must've thought hard about it.

264
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:12,420
She didn't want her mom to go
and leave her behind, so she thought hard.

265
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:16,510
She chased the image of
her father in her memories.

266
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:21,390
And the answer she came up with was...

267
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:25,260
"W-Welcome home."

268
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,140
"Did you enjoy yourself?"

269
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,890
"I'm glad to hear it."

270
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:31,690
--It was off the mark, it was ridiculous,
but it was what she had.

271
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,810
--"Oh, I see."
--It was off the mark, it was ridiculous,
but it was what she had.

272
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,570
--"Yes, that's fine."
--It was off the mark, it was ridiculous,
but it was what she had.

273
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:42,320
It was so foolish.
Watching her stubbornly keep at it...

274
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,160
Watching her do her best
to hide her loneliness...

275
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,500
Seeing her torture herself like that...

276
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:56,670
It was so foolish...
and it tugged at my heart.

277
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:06,100
I'm sure your mom knew all that.

278
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:13,520
But it still helped her. It did.

279
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,900
I hope that's true.

280
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,940
It is. Believe it.

281
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:23,070
I'm sorry for suddenly
acting so discouraged--

282
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:28,080
It's fine. Say whatever
you need, it's fine.

283
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,000
I won't be disappointed in you.

284
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:41,420
I refuse to apologize. Tohru-kun and I
communicated with our fists.

285
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,390
She never hit you.

286
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:50,930
I envy people who can entrust
their dreams and wishes to others.

287
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,770
I wonder if I can do it, too.

288
00:20:54,770 --> 00:21:00,860
Because that definitely wasn't pity.

289
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,070
I'm not lying! I can leave this to her!

290
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,360
Ridiculous.

291
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,070
This side of you is annoying.

292
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,740
Comfort me!

293
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,750
This man is my father.

294
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:20,710
So you kept a photo? That's very you.

295
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:28,140
Tell that to him!

296
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,680
Ky--

297
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,770
What's wrong?

298
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,480
Nothing.

299
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,000
I remember.

300
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,210
I put this away, but...

301
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,170
I'll never forgive you.

302
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,550
Kyo-kun...?

303
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:09,140
Is something the matter, Kyo-kun?!

304
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,350
--Kyo-kun? Kyu-kun?
--Now I remember.

305
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,100
Kyo-kun?!

306
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,700
I'll never forgive you.

307
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:51,550
"That's Right, It's Empty"

308
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:51,240
That's right, it's empty.
