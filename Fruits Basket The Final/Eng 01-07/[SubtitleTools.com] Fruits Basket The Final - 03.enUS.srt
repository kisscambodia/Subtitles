1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,190
--That concludes homeroom for today.
--This isn't fair--it's almost spring.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,020
And yet it's snowing.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,480
I don't want snow to pile up.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,990
A clean field of white snow,

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,790
all undisturbed and perfect...

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,580
I hate that.

7
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,010
"Fruits Basket"

8
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,350
Not much time left
until graduation, huh...

9
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,270
Huh? You're not graduating, though, Nao.

10
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,430
Honestly, what a pain!

11
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,690
You're late!

12
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,480
Only because another senior asked me out!

13
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,690
Don't you think it's selfish
to confess love to someone

14
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,530
you know you have no chance with?

15
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,070
I'm sure they get closure from it
or whatever, and a pity party, but still!

16
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:26,040
I bet you've had lots of trouble with
that lately too, right, Yun-Yun?

17
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,040
All I can do is hurt them.

18
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,250
Your guilt sounds
karmically appropriate to me.

19
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,260
You hurt people, after all.

20
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,840
Aw, shorty, are you jealous of Yuki
for being more popular? Eh, shorty?

21
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,260
Enough with the "shorty"!

22
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,890
I know I'm a shorty, okay?!
Yeah, I'm still shorter than my sister!

23
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,270
Is that so wrong?
Do shorties have no right to live?!

24
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,690
Uh, I didn't say anything...

25
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,820
Are you implying that height
is what makes a man attractive?!

26
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,480
Not at all, Nao-chan!

27
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,030
It's not his height or his face.

28
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,320
What makes a guy attractive...

29
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,080
...is his bank account.

30
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,000
True facts.

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,040
Argh! Fine, I know, I'm a commoner guy
with commoner parents!

32
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,290
I'll never have a Soma-level bank account!

33
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,500
Listen, that's Soma money,
not my personal money, okay?

34
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,050
I get it!

35
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,590
You have a crush on someone, don't you?

36
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:27,010
And that person is pining after Yun-Yun,
so you're jealous!

37
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,940
Oh, hey, Nao, didn't you
call Yun-Yun your rival once?

38
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,560
I remember that...

39
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,770
I'm right, aren't I, Nao-chan?!

40
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,110
Is she right, Nao-chan?

41
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,900
Just forget it! Isn't Kuragi here yet?!

42
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,200
Aha! Suspicious!

43
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,780
I think Kuragi-san will be a while.

44
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,160
She's still cleaning up chalk.

45
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,460
When will she get sick of stunts
like that? It's so annoying.

46
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,500
Oi, you can't just wander in here.

47
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,630
Are you two in Machi's class?

48
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,800
Yes!

49
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,670
Listen to this, President!

50
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,510
Kuragi-san just flipped over
a new box of chalk and dumped it out!

51
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,600
Again?

52
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,260
She's really scary!

53
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,730
I heard she got kicked out of her house

54
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,730
for trying to kill her own brother!

55
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:18,110
What? I didn't know that! Tell me more!

56
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,610
It's kind of a recent rumor.

57
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,450
But I hear it's true!

58
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:28,370
It's a lie! I'll always believe in Machi!

59
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,750
I'll never believe
the words you just said.

60
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,250
Kuragi-san?

61
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,250
--Machi...
--She ran away!

62
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,210
See, it must be true.

63
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,880
Oh no...

64
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,880
I believed in you!

65
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,140
What, you're done believing now?!

66
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,970
Kimi's faith is fickle.

67
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:59,020
Don't make excuses!
You were jealous of the baby all along!

68
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,780
I worried that might be the case.

69
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,240
Let's try living apart.

70
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,410
It's better for you.

71
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,030
Yes. It's for you.

72
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,330
You'll be more comfortable alone.

73
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:20,750
About what they said...
it's actually pretty close to the truth.

74
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:26,550
Machi has a little brother.
I mean, he's my half-brother too.

75
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,760
He's way younger.

76
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:34,100
These days, he's all set
to be the successor,

77
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:40,810
but apparently Machi was jealous,
she tried to kill him, and they found out.

78
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,610
They set her up with her own place
because she was dangerous.

79
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,990
That's hard for me to believe.

80
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:52,950
Well, it's the version I heard from
the parentals, so you may be right.

81
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,870
--Wanna ask Machi?
--What?

82
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,420
You can go to Machi's place
and just ask her.

83
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,420
What?!

84
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,750
Are you-- No, I can't! She lives alone!

85
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:07,300
You'll be fine! No guy could get
an erection in that room.

86
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,390
Don't make this about that!

87
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:14,140
Come to think of it, there was
this one time we got a ton of snow--

88
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,060
Can you stop giving me whiplash
with all the subject changes?

89
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,520
But I just remembered.

90
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,030
Anyway, there was some
family gathering that day.

91
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:28,900
I snuck out because
they were all being lame.

92
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,330
Machi was outside already.

93
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,660
I watched her,
wondering what she was up to.

94
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,160
She was walking around
leaving footprints in the snow.

95
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,040
She was super intent on it.
Just round and round. Dead silent.

96
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,010
I wonder what that was about.

97
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,390
Hiya!

98
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,640
Sorry to barge in!

99
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,850
--Hey!
--Come right in, Yun-Yun! Don't be shy!

100
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,730
Oi, Kake...

101
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,020
...ru?

102
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,400
It's as messy as always.

103
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,900
Go home!

104
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,240
This brings back memories...

105
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,320
It's the Sea of Decay.

106
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,870
Go home!

107
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,330
Yun-Yun!

108
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,040
Here, for you.

109
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,080
What?

110
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,960
This is my fault?!

111
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,790
Got any better stuff?

112
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:28,380
Okay, I'm off to take out the trash.

113
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,710
"←Yun."
"Machi. →"

114
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,300
Don't do anything pervy, Yun-Yun!

115
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,680
I won't. I'm not you.

116
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:38,100
Did you come... all this way... to clean?

117
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,350
No, um...

118
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:44,230
But glass on the floor
is dangerous, you know?

119
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:50,740
Are you sure you didn't come to ask
about what my classmates said?

120
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,120
Do what you want.

121
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,740
Believe them or don't.

122
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,580
I don't care.

123
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:05,130
My parents didn't believe me.
No one believed me.

124
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,960
I'm past trying to set
the record straight.

125
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,470
It doesn't matter now.

126
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:15,180
Machi, do orderly things bother you?

127
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,770
Stuff like undisturbed snow or tidy rooms.

128
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,730
Is it "perfection" that you hate?

129
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:29,610
Y-Yes...

130
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,570
Because it scares me.

131
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:37,120
Be perfect. Always.

132
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,740
Have a perfect personality
and perfect grades!

133
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,080
Otherwise, you can't beat
that other woman's son.

134
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,550
I was... I was always nervous.

135
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,090
If I had even the tiniest flaw,
she'd be angry at me.

136
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:59,430
It felt like she was telling me
to stand still on a thin, thin tightrope.

137
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:05,850
It intimidates me. I... can't breathe...

138
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,110
I can't stand it.

139
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:15,240
For a while, I tried my best to meet
their expectations anyway. But...

140
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,700
But now... I have
a little brother, so I...

141
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,460
Thank goodness we finally
got the boy we wanted!

142
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,290
I can't tell you how relieved I am.

143
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,800
Frankly, Machi's a bit... well, you know.

144
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,300
It's like she's got no individuality.

145
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,930
She's boring.

146
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:41,430
I guess good grades
aren't everything, are they?

147
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,520
Why?

148
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,310
Why would you say that?

149
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,770
Am I boring?

150
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:52,020
I did what you told me to, though.

151
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:56,570
I thought I worked so hard for you.

152
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,620
Don't talk like it's my fault.

153
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,240
You make it sound like
I did something wrong.

154
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:08,210
Well, maybe it is my fault, though.

155
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:12,960
Maybe I raised you wrong.

156
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,380
No...

157
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,340
That's not what I wanted you to say.

158
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,890
That's not it.

159
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:28,940
What am I supposed to do with that?

160
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,860
What am I supposed to do
if I'm something you got wrong?!

161
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,150
Where can I go?

162
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,990
You've worked hard.

163
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:53,790
You worked really hard to be
the Machi you are now,

164
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,130
and I'm glad you're here.

165
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,260
You did good.

166
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:07,560
I... never thought someone
would compliment me.

167
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:14,320
I never dreamed this day would come.

168
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:21,780
I'm flawed. Warped. No good.

169
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,780
But...

170
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,490
Someone complimented me anyway.

171
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,710
I-I...

172
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:43,340
I worried it was too cold.
That he'd catch a cold.

173
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:47,310
So I was putting a blanket
on him, that's all...

174
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,890
What are you doing?!

175
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,560
I wasn't trying to do anything bad...

176
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,270
But...

177
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,480
Don't make excuses!

178
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,280
I worried that might be the case.

179
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:06,660
I couldn't make them understand.
They'd already decided how I felt.

180
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,620
I wasn't jealous, though!

181
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,090
Okay.

182
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:23,300
Machi. If this snow piles up...

183
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,680
...let's make footprints in it together.

184
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,110
It's a promise.

185
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,240
Sorry! I'm so sorry!

186
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,370
Crap! You were totally
about to kiss, weren't you?!

187
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,580
What?! You moron!

188
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,750
I should've silenced my phone!

189
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:56,000
But the snow didn't stick.

190
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,460
It melted overnight and disappeared.

191
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,550
Anyone else have an opinion?

192
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,220
--All right, please proceed
with that plan.

193
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,930
--Hey, Kimi-chan.
--All right, please proceed
with that plan.

194
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,180
I got a new box for you.

195
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,850
Wow, really? I'm so happy!

196
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:17,190
But I'm not on chalkboard duty today.

197
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,110
Aw, man!

198
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:24,190
...instructions, and enter quickly
when it's their turn.

199
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,570
Next announcement: the club activity
time limits over spring break

200
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,660
have been revised.

201
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,540
--The hard end time was originally 6pm,
but now it's 5:30pm.

202
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,290
--The next time it snows...
--The hard end time was originally 6pm,
but now it's 5:30pm.

203
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,170
...will he still remember his promise?

204
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:42,050
Will he walk with me?

205
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,550
I hope it snows soon.

206
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:52,310
That was the first time I ever
I wished for it to snow,

207
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,730
and for the snow to stay.

208
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:59,520
Kyo-kun, here you go!

209
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,940
R-Right...

210
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,360
Thanks.

211
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:09,240
"Graduation Ceremony"

212
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:09,740
I guess there's only one year left
in our high school era.

213
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,330
Time certainly flies.

214
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,160
You guys work, too!

215
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,790
'Scuse me?! Have you forgotten you
owe me for getting those flowers back?!

216
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,880
I told you, that wasn't my fault!

217
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,880
Watch out!

218
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,050
Tohru!

219
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,180
--Are you okay?
--Y-Yuki-kun...

220
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,640
Bastard.

221
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,220
Kyon! If anything happens to Tohru...

222
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,480
...we'll never forgive you.

223
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,980
You two started it!

224
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,020
I was only checking in. See you later.

225
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,570
Are you going back to the student council?

226
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,740
No, I have an appointment.

227
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,160
Once I graduate,

228
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,660
there'll be no place for me
at this school anymore.

229
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:04,000
The familiar old hallways,
shoe boxes, and classrooms

230
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,010
will become someone else's home.

231
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:10,800
That's what graduation means.

232
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,010
That's what parting means.

233
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,350
But...

234
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,890
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

235
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:24,230
Oh, no, I'm just happy that you came!

236
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,030
Well, I should get right down to it...

237
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:33,870
I-I apologize; now that this moment
has come, I'm not sure what to say.

238
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,700
H-How awful of me.

239
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:44,170
I-I'm glad that I met you, Yuki.

240
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:50,470
I'm glad that I came to this high school.

241
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:53,390
Every day was busy, like a festival.

242
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,930
I got angry, I laughed,

243
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:00,600
and I caused a lot of trouble, too.

244
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,020
And you were always at the center of it.

245
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,900
I loved you.

246
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,070
I loved you, Yuki.

247
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,110
So...

248
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,700
So I'm praying!

249
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:26,920
Praying that you'll... that you'll find
your happiness too, Yuki.

250
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:34,800
And that if you're already happy,
you'll find even greater happiness.

251
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,020
I'm sure that what I experienced
here was happiness,

252
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:45,270
and so you're the one who gave it to me.

253
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:50,280
I can't give it back to you
in any other way, but...

254
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,530
Thank you.

255
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:00,040
Please, let him understand.

256
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:08,210
I'm not doing this to try
to make him return my feelings.

257
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:11,260
I just want to let him
know that I was happy.

258
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:20,350
Because it was fun.
Because I really am glad I met him. So...

259
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,310
Let him understand.

260
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,030
I don't deserve feelings
like those, but...

261
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,160
...yes.

262
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,990
Yes. Thank you very much.

263
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,250
But I--

264
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,920
H-Hold that thought, Yuki!

265
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,050
I feel quite good right now.

266
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:58,010
But you'll spoil that if you apologize.

267
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,720
If you apologize, I'll cry!

268
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,930
And these things
might be fairer than we think.

269
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:09,900
For all we know, someone might have
been pining for me all along, too--

270
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,230
Like former president Takei?

271
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,190
He is out of the question!

272
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:19,410
Honestly, Yuki, you're so...

273
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,620
Thank you.

274

"Graduation Ceremony"

275

We owe so much
to the kindness of our teachers

276

"Kaibara High School Graduation Ceremony"

277
00:18:53,320 --> 00:19:06,620
Our school years have gone by so quickly

278
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:19,800
Turned into months and years
before we knew it

279
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:28,230
Now is the time of our parting

280
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:34,440
Farewell

281
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,360
Are you sad to leave?

282
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:48,660
You found me. I'm sorry, I wanted
to take one last look at the classroom.

283
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,370
I'll go now.

284
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,040
M-Minagawa-sempai!

285
00:19:54,040 --> 00:20:00,220
Minagawa-sempai, I-I... I...

286
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:05,140
I a-always... always...

287
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:11,940
After partings come
new meetings, okay?!

288
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,270
After "goodbye" comes "nice to meet you"!

289
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,440
So...

290
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,410
So I'm praying that,
even after you graduate,

291
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:28,290
you'll be well and keep smiling.

292

Sakuragi-kun, you, too.

293
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,040
Be well.

00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:42,970
Thank you.

00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,260
Goodbye.

00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,180
Nice to meet you.

297
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,110
Hiro-chan, your name means
"a light on the path,"

298
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:59,320
so I named her
Hinata for "sunshine."

299
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,690
"Name: Hinata"

300
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,030
Cute, right?

301
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:06,410
Hinata-chan, this is your big brother!
He'll start middle school soon.

302
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:10,080
Come on, Hiro-chan, give her a hug.
Now's your chance!

303
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,670
What?! N-No, I can't hug her.
Hinata's a girl!

304
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:20,380
I've got it covered.
Mama's gonna hug you both!

Isuzu ended up graduating
while she was still in the hospital.

307
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:33,180
My, my. And so you went
to pick up her diploma for her?

308
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,190
You're so nice, Kagura.

309
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:38,400
Compliments from you are meaningless.

310
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,480
Hey...

311
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,570
Is Isuzu really in the hospital?

312
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,610
That's what I'm told.

313
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:53,950
But nobody I've asked knows
which hospital, and she won't answer--

314
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,370
Kagura.

315
00:21:55,370 --> 00:22:00,090
I bet your mom's advice
was not to investigate, right?

316
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:09,760
Yeah, but... somehow it feels
like she won't come back.

317
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,720
I'm worried.
