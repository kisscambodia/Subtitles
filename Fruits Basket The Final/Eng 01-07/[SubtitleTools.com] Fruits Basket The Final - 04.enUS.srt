1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,560
Akito...

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,270
I'll leave some water here.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,400
Kureno.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,240
Do you know what this is?

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,450
No.

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,700
That's right; you wouldn't know.

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,160
What's in that box?

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,330
Father.

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:33,380
Yes! My husband and I and Hiro-chan
are all thrilled that it's a girl!

10
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,800
Hinata-chan is the family celebrity!

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,970
Shouldn't you be with her?

12
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:42,060
It's fine! Hiro-chan is staying with her.

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,520
He's already right at home
in the big brother role.

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,480
Hinata-chan might end up idolizing him!

15
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,940
Say, when do you think Isuzu-chan
will get released from the hospital?

16
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,110
Who knows...

17
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,280
It seems like she's in
for a long time this round.

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,950
I wanted her to see Hinata-chan...

19
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:05,080
But I hear she didn't even get
to go to her graduation.

20
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,620
Oh, dear.

21
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,460
Haru!

22
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,010
I heard Rin is in the hospital.

23
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:17,800
Has anyone told you her condition,
or which hospital?

24
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,840
Why?

25
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,390
Well, Honda-san is worried.

26
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,680
Worried? About Rin?

27
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,810
Yeah, they're pretty close these days.

28
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,270
So Rin made a friend...

29
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:40,490
Yeah... But I'm asking because
Honda-san looked uneasy.

30
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,870
Oh. I dunno, though.

31
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,330
Wait, you don't know?

32
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:51,500
Nope. Seems like nobody knows the details.

33
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,750
The plot thickens...

34
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,380
Hey, this isn't some mystery nov--

35
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,180
Haru, are you okay?

36
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,050
I'm fine.

37
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,600
Eh... Yeah. I guess
normally, I'd panic more.

38
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,980
Maybe something's wrong with me.

39
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,030
Maybe something's been wrong with me.

40
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,190
Haru...

41
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,660
If I learn anything, I'll tell you.

42
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,120
Tell Honda-san "thank you."

43
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,450
If it all goes wrong... comfort her.

44
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,920
Hiro-chan!

45
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,130
Kisa! You've been home already?

46
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:40,760
Yep! Now I'm on my way to your house.

47
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,640
What about you?
You're still in your uniform.

48
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:50,140
Yeah, I stopped by Kagura-nee's house.
I wanted to see if Rin was back.

49
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,770
Oh... I see...

50
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,400
She's not back yet, though.

51
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,610
You're coming to visit Hinata, right?

52
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,990
Mm-hmm!

53
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:04,280
I guess it's too soon for her to start
expressing her feelings well,

54
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,240
but I hope she'll smile soon.

55
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,040
I bet by then, you'll be
an even better big brother.

56
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,210
We'll see.

57
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:17,340
But... yeah. I want to be.

58
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:24,010
When I look at Hinata,
I realize I'm pretty stupid.

59
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:29,060
It's like, here's this person who doesn't
even know good from bad yet,

60
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,230
and just is the way she is.

61
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:41,530
Whereas I'm always wrapped up my vanity,
my fear... I'm so small and stupid.

62
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,620
I want to become someone
who can protect her.

63
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,200
That hits me when I see her.

64
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,670
So... well, that's not exactly why, but...

65
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:58,630
I have to tell you something.

66
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,800
Kisa, I wanted to apol--

67
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,760
Oops. Sorry.

68
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,680
Seriously, you're the size of a house,

69
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,060
so can't you be a little more
considerate of your surroundings?

70
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,600
Eh...

71
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,890
You two got taller.

72
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,270
Never mind.

73
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,650
Be careful on your walk.

74
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,650
You be careful! And if you're
looking for Rin, she's not back yet.

75
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,360
But maybe that's not my business.

76
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,240
Hey, Hiro.

77
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,580
Was Rin sad?

78
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,250
Was she hurt?

79
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:39,630
Huh? Wait, are you talking about
that time I said...?

80
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,720
No, I just said that because
I was in a bad mood!

81
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,430
But...

82
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,010
I do know that she was suffering.

83
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,680
Haru-nii...

84
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:57,020
Akito pushed Rin off
the second floor balcony.

85
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,650
Those injuries...
they weren't an accident.

86
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,570
Akito found out about her and you.

87
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,490
And then... and then...

88
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,410
What are you doing?

89
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,290
K-Kureno-san...

90
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:15,960
Y-You shouldn't be here. It's off-limits.

91
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,170
Then why are you bringing food here?

92
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:26,050
Only the Cat is allowed in this cottage.

93
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:32,140
No one else can go inside,
and normally, no one wants to.

94
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,770
Who's in there?

95
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,640
I-I can't say. I'll get in trouble.

96
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,520
Trouble with whom?

97
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,480
I can't say!

98
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,230
M-My father is in indebted to...

99
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:49,950
If I f-fall out of favor...

100
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,620
Akito...

101
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,200
When Akito...

102
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,210
Kisa.

103
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,710
When Akito hit you...

104
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,040
...that was my fault.

105
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,420
What?

106
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,630
I've always wanted
to apologize to you for that.

107
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,510
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,010
I'm sorry to you too, Haru-nii.

109
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,270
Akito and Rin both told me
to keep my mouth shut.

110
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,480
It's okay if you're mad that I did.

111
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,480
Rin is trying to break the curse!

112
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:32,320
Rin is trying to free you...
from Akito and from herself.

113
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,990
That's why she left you.

114
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,540
Give me the key.

115
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,290
You can say I overpowered you.

116
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,500
This isn't right, you know.

117
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:51,430
She... She hasn't eaten for days.

118
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,680
She'll die at this rate!

119
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,850
Save her.

120
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,730
Tell her she can stop now.

121
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,690
Or she's gonna be messed up forever.

122
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,690
She'll just suffer alone forever!

123
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,030
Haru-nii?

124
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:26,550
Hiro-chan, you felt guilty
that I was hurt? All this time?

125
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:32,260
Even when I was smiling...

126
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:38,520
...you were hurting inside?

127
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,270
I'm sorry!

128
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,770
I'm so sorry!

129
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:49,690
I'm so selfish, I never even noticed!

130
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:54,280
Wh-Why are you apologizing?!
That's not right!

131
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,820
I'm the one...

132
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,790
It was my fault...

133
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,370
You can stop now.

134
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,750
You can stop now.

135
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:14,930
Hey, Hiro-chan, where do
you think Big Sister Isuzu is?

136
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,390
I don't know. But...

137
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:24,650
...I just hope she comes back healthy.

138
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,900
What's this about?

139
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:35,450
Hatsuharu-san! You may be a zodiac member,
but you have no right to barge in here!

140
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,120
Shut up. Get out of here, hag.

141
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,450
--How rude!
--It's fine.

142
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:46,000
It would seem Hatsuharu has
something important to speak to me about.

143
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,290
Very well.

144
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,380
Now, go right ahea--

145
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,720
Why did you push Rin?

146
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,680
Why the hell did you push her?

147
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,800
What are you talking about?

148
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,520
Me? Push Isuzu? First I've heard of it.

149
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,520
Who told you that story?

150
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,900
An oracle.

151
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,020
Excuse me?

152
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,940
You're always such a silly boy.

153
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,740
Enough laughing.

154
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,240
Why did you do it?

155
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,580
Were you trying to kill her?

156
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,830
Huh. So, you believe in oracles,

157
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:29,040
but you don't believe in me, your god.

158
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,590
Why would you get so angry
about Isuzu in the first place?

159
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,430
You've always been
kind to her, haven't you?

160
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,810
Is it because you feel sorry for her?

161
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,100
Is it pity?

162
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,680
It's because I love her!

163
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,150
And you've known that for a long time,

164
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,190
so don't ask just to provoke me!

165
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,360
Where's Rin?

166
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,910
You know where she is
right now, don't you?

167
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,660
What a worthless conversation.
Where do you get these ideas?

168
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,710
You've always treated Rin coldly.

169
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,710
You're always been
cold to her... to all girls.

170
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,180
You say and do cruel things
without even blinking.

171
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,390
If you're supposed to be "god,"
then be more--

172
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:29,520
So, you knew exactly what I was like
when you told me, "I love Rin."

173
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,190
You knew I hated Isuzu,

174
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,110
and you said it anyway.

175
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,660
Where is she?

176
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,200
Where is Rin right now?

177
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,160
I don't know. Stop asking.

178
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,490
Where did you put her?!

179
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,370
I said I don't know where she is!

180
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,500
--Stop making me
the bad guy behind every--

181
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,040
--We sent her to the hospital.
--Stop making me
the bad guy behind every--

182
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,630
Hatori-niisan took her in his car.

183
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,010
She wasn't fully conscious,
but don't worry.

184
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,090
I'm told her life isn't at risk.

185
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,020
Akito. You mustn't do things like that.

186
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:12,100
No matter who you are, there are
some things you just shouldn't do.

187
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,900
Where was she?

188
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,190
The Cat's...

189
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:22,410
She was locked up in the Cat's place.

190
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:28,120
You're mean. Why would
you betray me, Kureno?

191
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,040
Akito, it's not like that. Listen.

192
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,210
You're cruel!

193
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,170
Cut the bullshit, you little bastard!

194
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,420
--You lie and lie,
and he's the cruel one?!

195
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,500
--Hatsuharu!
--You lie and lie,
and he's the cruel one?!

196
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,760
Were you trying to kill her again?!

197
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,670
So what if I was?

198
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,760
It's only because you chose that girl.

199
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,970
You're the one who dug her grave!

200
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,100
Hatsuharu!

201
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,440
Rin.

202
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,270
Rin, what's wrong?

203
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,480
Another nightmare?

204
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,360
Yeah. But I'm fine.

205
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,070
You're here, so it's fine.

206
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:08,330
That's right. I knew.

207
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:13,250
I knew our love
might be digging Rin's grave.

208
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:18,380
I knew which direction Akito's obsession
and anger would turn in.

209
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,590
Deep down, I realized.

210
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:28,390
But I wanted her. Wanted to make her mine.

211
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:35,560
Even more than I wanted to protect her,
I just wanted her all to myself.

212
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,320
You're here, so it's fine.

213
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,440
It's not fine.

214
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,110
I'm no different than those adults.

215
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,700
Me being with you doesn't make it fine.

216
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,920
If Rin was secretly hurting
while I stuck my head in the sand...

217
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:03,090
Then it doesn't matter how much
I think I love her. It's worthless.

218
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,090
H-Hatsuharu...

219
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,640
Don't talk.

220
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,730
It makes me want to kill you and myself.

221
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,350
H-Hatsuharu...

222
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,770
Wait. Don't go.

223
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,440
Don't go, Hatsuharu!

224
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,780
Hatsuharu!

225
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,410
Hatsuharu.

226
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,280
Hatsuharu.

227
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,910
Go. Don't come back.

228
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:37,790
I'm sure Isuzu wants to see you.

229
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,500
The first word she said...

230
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,300
...was your name.

231
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,340
Haru.

232
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,720
Haru.

233
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,190
Akito...

234
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:03,980
Why does everyone want to betray me?

235
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:08,240
It's not that they want to betray you.
But everyone eventually--

236
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,910
Why do you betray me?!

237
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,950
Why? Why?!

238
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:18,120
I was born to be loved!

239
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,290
You were all waiting for me.

240
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:26,510
I know because... he told me...

241
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:32,050
Father... Father, help me...

242
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,930
Help me.

243
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,980
I can't find...

244
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,560
I'm coming in, Isuzu.

245
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,740
...a home to go to.

246
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,660
Why did you do such a thing?

247
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,410
Did you not realize

248
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:00,830
that taking her away without permission
was a betrayal of Akito-san?

249
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,710
You think I should have left her there?

250
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:07,880
Yes. Anything Akito-san wishes.

251
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,840
No. You're wrong--

252
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,300
You are the one in the wrong!

253
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:18,810
You zodiac members live for Akito-san,
and yet you commit this betrayal?

254
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:21,060
Whose side are you on?

255
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,980
Do you think she should win, then?!

256
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,820
That... That abominable, dissolute woman?

257
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,280
Know your place, Kureno-san.

258
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,950
You zodiac should merely
live and die for Akito-san.

259
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,420
Remember that without Akito-san,

260
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,840
all of you are monsters,
no better than the Cat!

261
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,630
Kureno...

262
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:53,590
That's right, I first came here
to see Kureno.

263
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:57,720
She was crying, and it pissed me off.

264
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,480
So I decided to grill him.

265
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:08,150
I planned to grab him by the collar
and punch him. And then...

266
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:13,160
Isuzu-chan, you naughty girl.

267
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,870
Did you sneak all the way in here?

268
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:23,370
You've been looking for something,
haven't you, Isuzu-chan?

269
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:26,210
Would you like my help?

270
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:33,470
Ren-san, do you know a way
to break the zodiac curse?

271
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:41,310
--You kn--
--If you grant my wish, I'll tell you.

272
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:48,150
What I want--
what should rightfully be mine--

273
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,030
is in Akito's room.

274
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,410
I can't get close to that room.

275
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:59,830
But perhaps you could.

276
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,920
Akito wouldn't have the guts
to tuck it away out of reach.

277
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,550
It'll be hidden by
nothing more than a door.

278
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:15,090
What... is it?

279
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,010
A treasure.

280
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:24,560
If I give her this, I'll learn the way.

281
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:29,270
I can free him... I can free Haru.

282
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:35,150
Oh, right.

283
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,950
I get it now.

284
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:43,700
Akito is like Mama, when Mama is mad.

285
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:49,590
I don't want to see your face,
or the rest of you, ever again.

286
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,010
I'll give you a choice:

287
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,350
You go into exile,
or Hatsuharu loses his eyesight.

288
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,180
Want to test me to see if I'm bluffing?

289
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,060
Don't. Don't do that.

290
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,360
I'll stay here.

291
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,400
I'll stay here till I die.

292
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,990
Haru, I'm sorry.

293
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:21,950
It was my chance
to learn the secret, but...

294
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,410
I'm no good. Just, no good.

295
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,630
I can't do a single thing right.

296
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,340
No wonder I'm not needed.

297
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,600
My, my, so that's what happened
to Isuzu-chan?

298
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,350
No wonder my wish showed
no signs of being granted.

299
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:55,070
Do you really know a way
to break the curse, though, Ma'am?

300
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,440
What?

301
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,320
Don't be silly. How would I know that?

302
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,240
That's what I thought.

303
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:08,410
I've always disliked her. Viscerally.

304
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:13,340
Still, I did think she'd be
a bit more useful...

305
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,340
But no good children are no good.

306
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:25,560
I'm here after all.

307
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,980
Was that all a dream?

308
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:34,190
I wish at least my last dream
were of Haru...

309
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:38,440
I want to dream of being
spoiled by his kindness.

310
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,200
Can't I have that, if I'm dying?

311
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,830
Haru?

312
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:55,130
It's Haru. I'm really dreaming of him!

313
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,260
I'm sorry. I couldn't do it.

314
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:08,640
I couldn't find your happiness.
I couldn't... find it...

315
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,640
I'm sorry!

316
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:18,190
That means your journey
is over, right Rin?

317
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,820
Yeah.

318
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,160
Then welcome home.

319
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:33,460
If your journey is over, I need you
to come home to me. Or I'll be lonely.

320
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,460
Haru is kind.

321
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:43,510
Well, in that case,
I'd better come home.

322
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:51,140
If I can go home to Haru,
then I'm glad. Truly.

323
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,770
'S a good dream.

324
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,190
It's not a dream.

325
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,570
I've been searching hard.
Everyone's worried about you.

326
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:06,530
I'm impressed you walked this far so sick.

327
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:09,240
H-Haru! I can walk by myself.

328
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,950
Nope.

329
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,210
I'm still a dumb kid,

330
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:20,500
and I thought I was worthless for
not noticing you were hurting, but...

331
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:25,930
I've grown up a little since then.

332
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:30,810
At least enough that I can carry you.

333
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,680
So I won't give up on you, Rin.

334
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:42,820
Walk when you can,
and let me carry you when you can't.

335
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,700
I'm going to carry you.

336
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,660
You're not a burden.

337
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,990
You're really not a burden.

338
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:58,420
The end... of a long journey...

339
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,380
H-Haru?

340
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,880
Yeah.

341
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,970
Haru...?

342
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,430
Yeah.

343
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,770
I'm... home.

344
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,440
Welcome home.

345
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:51,450
"I Mean... You Know, Right?"

346
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:50,200
I mean... you know, right?
