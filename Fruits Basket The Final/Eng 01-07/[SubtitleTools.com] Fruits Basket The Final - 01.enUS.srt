1
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,020
"I'll hold another banquet."

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,410
"I'll hold banquet after banquet,
forever unchanging..."

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,410
"I may be lonely right now..."

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,630
"...but everyone is waiting for me
on the other side of that promise."

5
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:33,380
That was in the long-distant past...

6
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,010
The original memory,
forgotten by everyone.

7
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,180
The original promise.

8
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,850
I'll see you soon.

9
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,020
Soon.

10
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,990
"Fruits Basket"

11
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,370
A girl?

12
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:25,160
Akito-san is... a girl?

13
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,420
Is that really true?

14
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,290
It's true.

15
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:38,090
It's the biggest of
the Somas' many secrets.

16
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:44,560
But Akito-san behaves like a man...

17
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,940
And none of the others
ever treat him like... a girl...

18
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,110
I never dreamed she was a girl.

19
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:58,900
Akito's been raised as male since birth.

20
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,990
She decreed it.

21
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,030
Who?

22
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,830
Someone who almost saw you
at the main estate.

23
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,460
Hatori!

24
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,460
What are you doing? Get away!

25
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,340
How many times must I
tell you to keep your distance?!

26
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,720
Akito, it's not like that.
She was only saying hello.

27
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:33,600
That's right, I was only saying
hello to Hatori. Is that so wrong?

28
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,900
You leer at any zodiac man you see.

29
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,910
What are you even doing here?
Go back to your room!

30
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:51,500
She rarely leaves her room. She has
some... troubles, mentally and physically.

31
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,630
But she still looms larger
than most in Akito's mind.

32
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,920
Ren Soma.

33
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,930
Akito's mother.

34
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,850
She's the one who decided
to raise her daughter as male.

35
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,060
Neither Akito nor Ren-san
will comment on it.

36
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,480
All I know for certain...

37
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,400
...is that they hate each other.

38
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:27,280
If you don't speak more nicely
to the zodiac members,

39
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,040
they won't like you anymore, Akito-san.

40
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,420
Hatori, you poor thing.

41
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,090
Hatori isn't a "poor thing"!

42
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:44,550
We have a bond. We're connected
in a world that you can't reach.

43
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,350
You're still spouting that nonsense?

44
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,260
You little fool.

45
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:57,900
How many times must I tell you
that those "bonds" aren't real love?

46
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,530
That "eternally unchanging"
concept you cherish so much is fake.

47
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,740
It's just a fantasy.

48
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,200
I pity the zodiac members
who have to put up with it.

49
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,160
Akito!

50
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,670
Oh yeah? How about you tell me
what's "real," then?!

51
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,460
Parental love?

52
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,710
--It's not like that's perfect!
--Akito! Akito, stop!

53
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,220
--Lots of parents abandon their children--
including plenty of Soma parents!

54
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,470
--Akito!
--Lots of parents abandon their children--
including plenty of Soma parents!

55
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,630
--Lots of parents abandon their children--
including plenty of Soma parents!

56
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,720
--Ma'am!
--Just like you did!

57
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,560
You can't define what's real or fake,
what's a false image or an idol!

58
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,980
No one can!

59
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,480
No one has the right to deny

60
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,400
the bond between me
and the zodiac, or our eternity!

61
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,780
The real thing exists!

62
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,120
Akira-san and me...

63
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,830
Akira-san and me have a real bond.

64
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,710
I'll kill you.

65
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,590
--I'll kill you!
--Go right ahead!

66
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:07,720
When I die, my soul will go
to Heaven and be with Akira-san.

67
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,050
I don't need you!

68
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:14,600
Akito, you were born to be loved.

69
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,980
Everyone was waiting for you.

70
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,480
Ren-san says the ties that bind Akito
and the zodiac members are wrong.

71
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:30,280
She says they're unnatural. Not real.

72
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,200
So she's constantly clashing with Akito,
who clings to our bonds.

73
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,040
That day...

74
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,710
The morning after Ren-san conceived Akito,
I woke up in tears.

75
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:52,140
So did Shigure-niisan,
Hatori-niisan, and Ayame-niisan.

76
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:58,140
We're the only zodiac members
who know that Akito is female.

77
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:03,690
Apparently, Ritsu was
too young to sense it clearly.

78
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:08,320
But the four of us all had the same dream.

79
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:14,950
Akito, the god we hadn't seen yet,
came to us in the dream and said,

80
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,580
"I'll see you soon."

81
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:23,580
So we ran straight to Ren-san,
who didn't know she was pregnant yet.

82
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:29,760
As we cried, we just kept saying,
"We've been waiting for you."

83
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:38,140
It... It was like this feeling
I didn't recognize welled up in my heart,

84
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,640
and I sensed a me
that wasn't me, shouting.

85
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,520
It was the zodiac spirit.

86
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:52,700
Another self that lived
inside me. In my blood.

87
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:57,990
At the first sign of a new ego forming,
the zodiac blood begins to hound us:

88
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,410
"Never betray Akito."

89
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:06,040
They made a promise
to be together for eternity.

90
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,300
No matter how many times
they were reborn.

91
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:14,680
Now that my curse is gone,

92
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,060
I can see that our bond was unnatural.

93
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,810
Ren-san is right.

94
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,850
But I see something else, too.

95
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,110
A crying girl.

96
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,860
Akito, it's okay.

97
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,910
Calm down. It's okay.

98
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,740
This way, ma'am.

99
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,460
Akito-san.

100
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,750
Do you think a crybaby like you can win?

101
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,920
Come on, let's go back.

102
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,430
Why...

103
00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:03,810
Why is she always so mean?

104
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,730
She's cruel!

105
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,310
Hatori!

106
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,570
Hatori, gimme a hug.

107
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:22,330
I can't push away a crying Akito.

108
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:28,380
And I can't see Arisa while
there's another girl I have to stay with.

109
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,300
I'm sorry to unsettle you
by telling you all this.

110
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:40,300
But I wanted you to know that

111
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:45,350
"Watch alone"

112
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,100
the same Akito who wounds others
too easily is herself deeply wounded.

113
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,320
I wanted to give you an idea
of why I can't leave her.

114
00:09:53,980 --> 00:10:01,950
I... I should say something...
I know I should...

115
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,000
...but I can't make any words come out.

116
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,670
I'm sorry. All I ever do is hurt others.

117
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:18,220
But this is the path I chose.

118
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,430
The one I took of my own free will.

119
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:29,230
I'm sorry. And thank you--for everything.

120
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,320
I'm frozen.

121
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:43,160
Everything's frozen...

122
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:49,710
It's a chain, a spiral of sadness...

123
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,590
...and everything's frozen.

124
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:07,430
I couldn't find the motivation to work,
so I wanted to get some fresh air.

125
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:10,810
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

126
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,880
Here I am to save the day.

127
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,880
Ta-da.

128
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,320
What? What do you mean?

129
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,860
Just what I said: Tohru is in my custody.

130
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,910
She'll be mine all night.

131
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:06,410
Hanajima-san,
your phrasing is a little sketchy...

132
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:11,580
You dare to object to
my sudden Nightgown Festival?

133
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,630
I think the term is "pajama party"...

134
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,210
But no, it's no problem.

135
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,960
Excellent. Goodbye.

136
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,390
It's no problem,
but it is a little strange.

137
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,640
Did something happen to Honda-san?

138
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,850
Who called?

139
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,520
Hanajima-san. She says Honda-san
is staying the night there.

140
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,860
You're fine with ordering out, right?

141
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,900
My goodness. Was she really that shocked?

142
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,950
Saki-chan might be pissed at me
if she doesn't bounce back...

143
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,500
That's a scary thought.

144
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,870
Oh, hey.

145
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,380
Maybe I should try making dinner.

146
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,460
Do we have a cookbook?

147
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,630
That's scary! Don't do it!

148
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:04,010
It's okay. I can do it
if I try harder... I think...

149
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:06,010
But maybe you can't!

150
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,850
Saki-chan!

151
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:12,890
Has Tohru-chan had dinner?
Is there anything she'd like to eat?

152
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,480
Shark fin.

153
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,690
That's what you want.

154
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:21,820
And you just ate, Saki-chan!

155
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,780
Mom, she says no dinner.

156
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,110
You should make her tea.

157
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:31,490
Oh, you're right! How rude of me! Tea!

158
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,040
Megumi?

159
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,000
You know what to do.

160
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,330
I'm on it.

161
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,090
The tea is ready.

162
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,800
Oh, thank you...

163
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,930
Careful, it's hot.

164
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,970
Right...

165
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:58,900
U-Um, Hana-chan? What brought you there?

166
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,400
You were crying.

167
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:07,950
It was in a voice no one but me
could hear, you were crying so loudly.

168
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,080
Something sad happened, didn't it?

169
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:25,710
I... Hana-chan, I'm... so confused...

170
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:31,760
My curse has already broken.

171
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,640
A girl?

172
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,230
Akito-san is...

173
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,900
Akito's mother.

174
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:47,400
So... I won't see Arisa.

175
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,080
"Kureno-san"...

176
00:14:53,080 --> 00:15:01,290
"Kureno-san" is... Kureno Soma...

177
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:07,380
I wanted him to go see Uo-chan,
so... I asked him to...

178
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:11,550
But he said he can't.

179
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:19,390
Because... Because he has
someone he needs to stay with...

180
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:26,440
K-Kureno-san is a caring man who...

181
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:35,830
...puts someone else's
feelings before his own...

182
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:40,410
I couldn't say anything!

183
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:45,590
So many people have had to help me...

184
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:52,680
...but when it was my turn,
I couldn't do anything.

185
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:57,180
I was useless!

186
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:03,850
Uo-chan... Kureno-san...

187
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:15,320
You do the same thing.
You put others' feelings before your own.

188
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:21,660
I... worry about you.

189
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:28,210
If you keep taking on
people's feelings like that,

190
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,130
and treating them carefully...

191
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:38,310
...and carrying them on your shoulders...

192
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:44,140
I worry that one day
they'll crush you.

193
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,900
Look at this, Kyo-kun!

194
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,400
I bought a new scarf!

195
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,740
It even has pom poms!

196
00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:03,710
I worry that if they crush you,
we'll never see your smile again.

197
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,210
If that happened...

198
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,300
If that happened,
it'd be the end of the world.

199
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,760
I called her.

200
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,850
You told me to hurry,
so I ran all the way here from work!

201
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,060
Did you hear us?

202
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,270
I heard.

203
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,650
So, listen...

204
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:33,900
I'm trash for making you cry.

205
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,660
Uo-chan, you're not "trash"!

206
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,780
Well, you're not "useless."

207
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,250
I love you, you dummy.

208
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,960
You can stop worrying. I'm all right.

209
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,630
I mean it this time.

210
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:57,680
I was right: Kureno's just like you.

211
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,560
You're the same kind of dumb.
So I figure...

212
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,140
...I just love dummies.

213
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:11,320
I don't want to make problems
for people like you.

214
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,650
So that's the end.

215
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,030
That's it.

216
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,870
So you loved and lost?

217
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,000
Why, you...

218
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,380
Megumi, we need to be sensitive right now.

219
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:37,170
But some things just take a long time.

220
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:40,890
Some friends and lovers, too.

221
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,640
So it wasn't all for nothing.

222
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:49,230
Well, duh! That's my personal creed.

223
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,280
All right, shall we start the party now?

224
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,490
Oh, I'll help!

225
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:02,780
My heart pounds as
I'm surrounded by older women.

226
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,490
That line again?

227
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,910
"Soma"

228
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:21,260
Isuzu-chan, you naughty girl.

229
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,850
Did you sneak all the way in here?

230
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:31,190
You've been looking for something,
haven't you, Isuzu-chan?

231
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,940
I know all about it.

232
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,860
Would you like my help?

233
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,950
They passed out.

234
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,580
Yes.

235
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:50,910
I think the chance to take a break
from her own feelings

236
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:54,000
made Arisa feel a little better.

237
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,380
Do you think there's any chance left?

238
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:04,430
Well, that may be
another story altogether.

239
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,850
Romance is tough.

240
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,190
Yes.

241
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:17,650
The sun always comes up again.

242
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:22,860
There's no night that doesn't end...

243
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,080
So I'll start again, one thing at a time.

244
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,210
I'm home!

245
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,000
Shigure-san?

246
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,750
I wonder if he's still... sleeping...?

247
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:44,890
What's this scarf doing here?
Could this be mine?

248
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,050
Wh-What...?

249
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:50,470
So it is yours?

250
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,940
Glad I didn't guess wrong.

251
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,850
It was lying all crumpled in the street.

252
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,270
U-Um--

253
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,940
I washed it,
but not all the stains came out.

254
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,450
If that bugs you, buy another one.

255
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,450
Stop it, that's not dry yet!

256
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,740
Told you.

257
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:16,080
Thank you! I'll never, ever drop it again!

258
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,250
Okay, then.

259
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,840
You stayed at Hanajima's last night?

260
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:25,590
Yes! Uo-chan came, too,
and we had a Nightgown Festival!

261
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,930
A what?

262
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,050
It was so much fun!

263
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,060
Good morning. Was it a fun party?

264
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,100
Good morning!

265
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,480
Morning!

266
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,150
Good morning!

267
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:42,070
You know, Yuki-kun's cooking last night

268
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:45,860
reminded me of just how much
I appreciate you, Tohru-kun.

269
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:50,370
It was so weird I don't even know if
it was bad--actually, it was really bad.

270
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,240
"Just remembered it"

271
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,490
I almost died!

272
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:55,540
Maybe I really can't do it...

273
00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:02,000
I'd like to puzzle those
things out one at a time.

274
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,220
Uo-chan, Hana-chan!

275
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,260
Yo!

276
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,340
Good morning, Tohru-kun.

277
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:14,680
All those things Kureno-san told me.

278
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:51,550
"That's an Unwavering Truth"

279
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:50,880
"That's an Unwavering Truth."
