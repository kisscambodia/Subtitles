1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:08,020
Even if the world doesn't need me,
I'll keep living for someone who does.

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,440
It works for me.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,660
But my custody rights might've
been at risk for a while there!

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,030
"Custody"?

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,790
There was more craziness
after that, like moving,

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,710
but I think I bounced back
while I kept busy.

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,130
Tohru was there for me, after all!

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,080
Uh-huh...

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,840
Seriously, Tohru is so cute! Like,
cutest in the world--no, the universe!

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,430
But Katsuya Honda...

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,800
You don't want to go see him anymore?

12
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:45,440
I wonder how much time
and effort it'll take

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,480
for you kids to find your answers...

14
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:55,030
Those words sounded ridiculous to me.

15
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:02,490
Because I'd always felt like I was
only born to take other people's contempt,

16
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,120
and I only continued
living to hurt people.

17
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,670
And wasn't I right?

18
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,960
That's why she died...

19
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,550
That's why Mom died, isn't it?

20
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,090
Didn't she want to tell me
it was my fault, in the end?

21
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:24,310
And you, too. You smiled at me,
but don't you hate me now...?

22
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,070
It's not your fault, Kyo.

23
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,190
You did nothing wrong.

24
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:40,870
But you can't go outside.
Outside is full of bad things.

25
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,330
Come in the house with Mom, okay?

26
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:49,920
Let's live inside forever.

27
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:55,380
Do what your mother tells you.

28
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,420
I'll never forgive you.

29
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,100
I'll go in the house and wait for you.

30
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,220
You'd better get your butt inside.

31
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,600
Or else something
even scarier will happen.

32
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,830
Ta-da! This is... Tohru!

33
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,580
Thank you!

34
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,460
Are those shapes going to grill okay?

35
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,790
Not to worry! You can leave it to me!

36
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,960
Kyo! The food's almost ready!

37
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,210
Kyo?

38
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,470
Could he be asleep?

39
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,640
He'll show up eventually.

40
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,020
They showed up in my dream
to smack down that thought.

41
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,940
To remind me...

42
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,690
"Know your place. Don't fool yourself."

43
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,200
Because I thought maybe...

44
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,200
...just maybe...

45
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,780
...Tohru loved me back.

46
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,540
Stupid thought.

47
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,000
"Fruits Basket"

48
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:46,390
Did you slip away from your servant again
so that you can walk as you please?

49
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:51,060
Sometimes I need to go outside
and look for someone to talk to.

50
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,140
Right, Shigure?

51
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,810
That reminds me...

52
00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:00,520
I hear you recruited Isuzu as
an errand girl to fetch a box for you.

53
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,110
You certainly have an ear to the ground.

54
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:08,740
Or perhaps she's just talkative?
Truly no good.

55
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,330
You're the no-good one, Ren-san.

56
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,830
I told you that was our secret.

57
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,920
Did you really?

58
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:23,380
To me, it sounded like
a suggestion to go get it from her.

59
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,220
Well, I'm offended.

60
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,890
But I'm afraid the operation failed.

61
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:32,560
This would be much easier
if you just brought it to me.

62
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,520
What? No, I don't want to do that.
It feels blasphemous somehow.

63
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,650
It is blasphemous.

64
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,200
No one but me has the right
to touch Akira-san.

65
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,160
His flesh, his blood, his soul...

66
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:55,040
I'm the only one worthy to own
anything to do with Akira-san.

67
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,870
I hear another marriage talk fell apart.

68
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:04,130
Can't they compromise? The doctor says
he's not long for this world anyway.

69
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,550
That's exactly why! I mean,
there has to be a successor.

70
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:13,510
True, no one wants "outsiders"
to fall heir to that money.

71
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:18,350
Akira-san and I met
because we were meant to.

72
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,230
It was destiny.

73
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,440
You must be so lonely,
and afraid of dying alone.

74
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,410
And no one else notices.

75
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:36,250
But I'm different. I see it.

76
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:43,960
Give me all of your pain, every last bit.

77
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,130
Because I love you.

78
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,930
Obviously this cannot be allowed!
You're a servant!

79
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,350
--We're in love.
--Silence!

80
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,220
Get out of here this instant.

81
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:02,560
--Never set foot on the Soma estate ag--
--Ren noticed that I was lonely.

82
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,690
She cried for me.

83
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,280
It was bliss.

84
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,200
Akira-san and I were
the only ones in the world.

85
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,120
I was the only one in Akira-san's world.

86
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,830
It was enough.

87
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,540
And yet...

88
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:30,630
Hey, they said Akito-san's
gonna be raised as a boy.

89
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,890
But why?

90
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,760
Apparently, Ren-san
decided on it a while ago,

91
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,310
because she said a female heir
could cause issues.

92
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,850
I heard she threw a fit and said

93
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,900
she'd abort unless everyone
considered him a boy.

94
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:49,280
She's just miffed that she's not
Akira-san's "number one" anymore.

95
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,200
And jealous, too.

96
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,200
Why won't you hold Akito, Ren?

97
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,960
Why bother? Everyone else
already loves that child, don't they?

98
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,840
Akito was born for them to love.
It's only natural.

99
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:14,390
Remember Ren-san's face that day
we went to meet Akito?

100
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,060
She thought, "Oh, crap."

101
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,600
Gure-nii... I don't get it.

102
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,690
Everything Gure-san says
is too complicated.

103
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,940
Does it mean Ren-san is bad?

104
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,570
It means she should be pitied.

105
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,450
All of the Somas should...

106
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,240
You poor thing.

107
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,420
Aren't you a "poor thing," too?

108
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:50,550
You're at Akito's mercy,
thanks to that antiquated "bonds" curse.

109
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:55,800
You don't really love
that child, you know.

110
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,010
You're just caught up in a fantasy.

111
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:02,140
Haven't you noticed?

112
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:07,190
You're looking at me
the same way you did then.

113
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,770
You want me.

114
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:19,120
Yes, I've noticed. Looking at you
gives me a rush of affection.

115
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,790
It lets me fantasize about whether she'd
look like you if she lived as a girl.

116
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,420
You're quite right.
I wanted you to take that box.

117
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,550
You're the right one to have it.

118
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:41,430
One person possessed by
Akira-san's ghost is enough.

119
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,310
--Shigure--
--Akito doesn't need that thing.

120
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,520
There's something wrong
with you--all of you!

121
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,360
Who do you suppose you have to thank
for that kid even being alive?!

122
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,240
Who do you think saved Akira-san?!

123
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,700
It's all because I was with him!

124
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,540
Akira-san...

125
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,210
Why...

126
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,000
Why didn't you call for me?

127
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,590
D-Did Akira-san die all alone?!

128
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,590
Quiet.

129
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:24,010
It was sudden.
There was no time to call for you.

130
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:28,690
And he was not alone at the end--
Akito-san was with him.

131
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:34,480
Akito-san safely carries
Akira-san's final wishes.

132
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,280
Excuse me?

133
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,740
--You're nothing! You're just a toy
for Akira-san to pass the time with!

134
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,990
--How dare you!
--You're nothing! You're just a toy
for Akira-san to pass the time with!

135
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,370
--How dare you!
--Now that Akira-san is gone,
you're officially unnecessary!

136
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,620
--Now that Akira-san is gone,
you're officially unnecessary!

137
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,750
You're wrong.

138
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,830
I'm special.

139
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:56,880
I was promised eternity.
Everyone was waiting for me, too.

140
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,180
So I'm not unnecessary.

141
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,890
I know, because Father told me.

142
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,180
If you mock Father's words...

143
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,560
...then you're the unnecessary one.

144
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:17,940
Go ahead, believe that silly fantasy
of "bonds" and "eternity."

145
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,410
It's too stupid to last long anyway.

146
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:25,660
Eventually it'll fall apart,
and you can learn the hard way

147
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:30,160
that no one really wanted you!

148
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:36,210
Akira-san! Akira-san!

149
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,590
Akito? You're awake.

150
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,760
Mm-hmm.

151
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,770
I need to talk to you, Akito.

152
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:51,730
I was so happy when I met Yuki.

153
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,270
What?

154
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:57,230
I was the God, and he was the Rat
who stands at the top of the zodiac,

155
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:02,450
and those two roles
hadn't been reborn in so long.

156
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:08,950
Back then, I could still
show off in front of her.

157
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:16,420
Even when she said things
that hurt me, I could still...

158
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:21,760
Where did my world start to fall apart?

159
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:29,810
Yuki-kun left the estate
to go live with Shigure, I hear.

160
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:34,850
So, I take it that the Rat was
the second one to desert you?

161
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:38,940
Don't let your one-night stand
with Shigure go to your head.

162
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,570
I haven't been deserted.

163
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:46,030
Everyone comes back to me in the end.

164
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:51,290
Because we can't be separated.
That's the bond between us.

165
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,960
I'm sick of that line.

166
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,420
If you truly believe the zodiac
who get a taste of the outside world

167
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:03,800
will still come back to the gloomy "god"
who binds them hand and foot, then win.

168
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:10,220
Prove that nobody can break your
little dream and rub it in my face!

169
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,270
And if you lose...

170
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:19,110
Grovel to me and then get out.

171
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,270
I believed.

172
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:30,330
Akito-san, I'd like to let Kyo and...
one other person live at my house.

173
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,290
Would that be okay?

174
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,910
I believed I could win.

175
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,090
I believed no one could break this...

176
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:46,970
No. I wished--almost prayed.

177
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,930
I repeated it like a curse.
Like I'd die if I didn't say it.

178
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:58,400
I said basically the same words
over and over and over...

179
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:04,320
But it's no good anymore. They're leaving.

180
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,280
Leaving me behind.

181
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,360
Stop at once!

182
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,660
Someone stop her!

183
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:21,250
You know, when I woke up
this morning, my head was so clear.

184
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:26,050
I should've just done this to begin with.

185
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,680
Give back Akira-san!

186
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:36,060
I don't know what of Akira-san's you're
hiding here, but give it back! It's mine!

187
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,940
Everything of Akira-san's belongs to me!

188
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:44,360
I didn't want to lose to this woman.

189
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,660
I wanted to prove it however
I could and rub it in her face.

190
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,120
Because I...

191
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,790
If it you want it that badly,
I'll give you the stupid thing!

192
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:04,420
I always knew...

193
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,720
Don't worry, Akito.

194
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,970
I'm not leaving you behind.

195
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:23,770
Even if you can't see me,
I'll be by your side.

196
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,900
Special child...

197
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:33,280
Ren was the one I most wanted
to be happy about you...

198
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:39,660
As her man, all I could do was die...

199
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:43,710
...but at least I can leave her a child.

200
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:49,470
And our child being special

201
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:54,930
proves that Ren and I were special, right?

202
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:02,980
It's too bad we couldn't
reconcile... Ren...

203
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:11,490
You were magnificent, showing such
a dauntless attitude to that woman...

204
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:17,200
But... But the one Father loved
most wasn't me, it was--

205
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,950
No.

206
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:23,460
Akira-san loved you best, Akito-san.

207
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,040
You mustn't let yourself be fooled.

208
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:31,010
Didn't Akira-san say he'd be by your side?

209
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:37,680
You have this, and Akira-san
belongs to you alone.

210
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,520
Is there something inside?

211
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,850
Akira-san's...

212
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,810
...soul.

213
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,320
It's empty.

214
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,820
That's right, it's empty.

215
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,570
Always has been.

216
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:01,290
Because I'm the one
who's always been "Other."

217
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:05,370
Because this has been broken
from the beginning.

218
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:20,180
Hiro-chan! Hinata-chan!

219
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,140
Lunch is ready to--

220
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,770
--Hi--
--Sorry.

221
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:33,570
I'm in a complicated mood...

222
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,660
I wish I could just feel happy.

223
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:41,160
But I have all these mixed feelings

224
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:47,330
like anger, resentment, regret,
repentance, attachment...

225
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,130
Yeah.

226
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:55,920
You've lived your whole life
with those bonds, after all.

227
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,850
Goodbyes make us lonely.

228
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:08,400
It's no good anymore. They're really...

229
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,690
...falling apart.

230
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,360
Goodbyes keep coming.

231
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,070
--What's wrong?
Weren't you going to kill me?

232
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,570
--Ma'am!
--What's wrong?
Weren't you going to kill me?

233
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,030
--What's wrong?
Weren't you going to kill me?

234
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,410
Just shut up!

235
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,910
Why did you even bring a weapon in here?!

236
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:28,500
You're one to talk!
Your charge tried to kill his own parent!

237
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,630
And you gave him that silly box!

238
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:33,880
--The poor family head is so innocent
he believed in it, and now--

239
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,510
--Of course he doesn't believe in it!
--The poor family head is so innocent
he believed in it, and now--

240
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,590
I gave him that box to comfort him

241
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:42,140
when his heart was wasting away
after Akira-san's death!

242
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,310
It's like a charm.

243
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,690
Anyone with common sense
would know it was empty!

244
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:51,060
I told you, you mustn't give
such things to the family head!

245
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,490
Akito.

246
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,740
I was fifty-fifty.

247
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:04,410
I believed in that box,
and I didn't believe in it.

248
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,330
It was empty when I opened it.

249
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:12,710
But I thought, maybe there was
an invisible power.

250
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:17,840
Maybe... maybe...

251
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,680
So I couldn't get rid of it,

252
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:25,930
but I didn't want to look
into it anymore, so I hid it.

253
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:31,310
That's right.
I clung to it all these years.

254
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:36,280
Can you blame me?
That was my common sense!

255
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,400
Nobody taught me otherwise!

256
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,030
Nobody ever gave me
any other way to live than this one!

257
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:47,040
How am I supposed to know things
I don't know?!

258
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,080
How am I supposed to get it?!

259
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,160
Why--

260
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:58,590
You can start learning the things
you don't know or don't get now.

261
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:02,550
Let's change, Akito.

262
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:09,430
If you stay in this environment,
the Somas and the bonds will crush you.

263
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,350
You'll stay empty.

264
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,400
--So--
--Too late.

265
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,860
It's too late for you to say that.

266
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,690
"Change"? We're past that point.

267
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:25,490
Why didn't you say that in the beginning?

268
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:30,580
Why didn't you push me away
from the beginning?

269
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,210
Why didn't you abandon me?

270
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,960
--I know.
--You're changing your mind now?

271
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,250
I know.

272
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,510
I don't want that lecture now.

273
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:53,770
That "kindness" of yours that
only half-saves me or half-rejects me...

274
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:58,020
It's been killing me!

275
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:03,070
This whole time!
So take responsibility. Pay for it!

276
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,160
Atone with your death!

277
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,660
Wait--

278
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,410
Kureno-san!

279
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,410
What happened? You're bleeding!

280
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,210
--Never mind.
--What?!

281
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:18,170
Forget me, go after Akito. Fast!

282
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,500
Someone help!

283
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:24,630
It's too late now.
Now... after all this time...

284
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,600
Yeah, it's dead.

285
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,180
Ugh. I wonder if a cat
killed it or something?

286
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,060
Or it hit a windowpane.

287
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,650
You two finish cleaning yet?

288
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:43,690
Forget that, there's a dead bird out here!

289
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,740
Were you just tired?

290
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,280
Thank you.

291
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,700
You're welcome!

292
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,660
I'm going out for a bit.

293
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,790
Kyo-kun!

294
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:08,470
Please, there's...
something I'd like to tell you.

295
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:51,550
"I'm Disappointed in You"

296
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,510
I'm disappointed in you.
