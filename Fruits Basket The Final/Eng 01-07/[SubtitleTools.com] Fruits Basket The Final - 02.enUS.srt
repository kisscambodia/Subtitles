1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,690
Shigure, do you love me?

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,440
Have you been walking around
asking everyone that?

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,950
I'm the one asking the questions.

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,530
Do you love me?

5
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,420
I care about you more than anyone.

6
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,090
That's an unwavering truth.

7
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,810
Yes, Akito, I love you.

8
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,990
"Fruits Basket"

9
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,780
Oho!

10
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,330
You're making paper flowers!
That's a blast from the past.

11
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,330
Are they for school?

12
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,540
Yes, they're for the graduation ceremony!

13
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,380
Our class is in charge of
the flower decorations.

14
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,800
Graduation season already, eh?
So you three will be seniors?

15
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,140
Time sure flies.

16
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,720
Hey, can I try opening one up?

17
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,850
Oh, yes, go right... ahead...

18
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:54,020
The only ones who know
that Akito is female...

19
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,780
Sh-Shigure-san...

20
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,200
Yes?

21
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,240
Is A...?

22
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,500
Um, all right, I-I'll go make some tea!

23
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,750
Okay!

24
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,720
Yeah, I guess that's
a tough topic to ask about.

25
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,640
It's hard to ask about!

26
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,650
I'm not sure how meaningful
it would be to ask...

27
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,560
Wouldn't I just be interrogating him?

28
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,940
And the things Kureno-san told me

29
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:46,700
make me feel like I'm looking
into a deep, dark well.

30
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,250
Your class is making
flowers too, huh, Tohru?

31
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,050
Mine is, too! We're twinsies!

32
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,130
Yes, we are!

33
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,050
I'm having fun with my class,

34
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,810
but the seniors have to graduate,
so I bet they're sad.

35
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,520
--I imagine--
--Indeed I am sad!

36
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,390
Yuki-kun...

37
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,600
--Just repeat senior year.
--Yeah, right!

38
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,320
Why do you always appear
out of nowhere just to be rude?!

39
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,570
Oh, I thought about repeating a grade!

40
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,950
Because Papa said Momo
wants to come to this school.

41
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:34,210
Papa was panicking. But I'll graduate
by the time she starts, you know?

42
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,130
--Momiji.
--Hmm? What?

43
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:45,430
I can't tell Momiji-kun, either.
Not even about Uo-chan and Kureno-san.

44
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,510
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:52,810
I don't know what
I can talk about, or how much.

46
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,350
What would people think if I did?

47
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,230
How would they feel?

48
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,040
--Huh?
--Halt, thieves!

49
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,790
Give those back!

50
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:22,170
Crap, they must have waited
until most of our class left.

51
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,050
U-Um, what just happened?

52
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:29,970
They stole all the flowers Yuki made.

53
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,060
Wh-Why would they do that?!

54
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,310
Well...

55
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,850
--Because they're Prince Yuki.
--Because they're Prince Yuki.

56
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,730
We did it! We did it, girls!

57
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:42,480
We overcame all obstacles to obtain these!

58
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,360
Yes, Motoko-sempai!

59
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,240
And they didn't see through our disguises!

60
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,320
"Yes, they did."

61
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,160
Give them a talking-to, Hanajima-san.

62
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,000
It would bring me no personal gain.

63
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,540
That does it. Our only choice is...

64
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,790
You fold more flowers, Kyon.

65
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,800
There you go again.

66
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,760
They stole that jerk's flowers, not mine.

67
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,220
Yeah, but he already left
for the student council.

68
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,850
So what? I just finally
finished my share--

69
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,230
--They're gone!
--Not my problem.

70
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,850
Dammit...

71
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,150
Where'd they go?!

72
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,860
I did it! Whoever gets Kyo's
flowers gets his love!

73
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,990
For real?

74
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,280
You just decided that.

75
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,570
He'd love all of us if that were true...

76
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:36,120
Whoever took these, I won't say,
"I'll kill you." But go to hell!

77
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,710
Not how normal people do "kindness."

78
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,670
That was kindness?

79
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,290
Now you'll have to start over either way.

80
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,790
You're kidding me!

81
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,210
Seriously, though,
what do we do about the prince's?

82
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:49,220
It doesn't seem right to call him
back here to make more.

83
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,430
Not like this was Yuki-kun's
fault anyway.

84
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:57,930
Wait, does that mean we have to make them?

85
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:01,150
Grrr! Who do they think they are, dammit?!

86
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,190
We're gonna find those girls
and take the flowers back!

87
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,190
--Yeah!
--Yeah!

88
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,190
What? B-But, um, I think it would be
better to make more...

89
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,740
Don't be soft on crime, Tohru!

90
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,370
You just don't want to make them.

91
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,870
Let's go! You, too, Hanajima!

92
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,910
Well, if you require firepower...

93
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,250
Hold the fort, Tohru!

94
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,670
What?!

95
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,630
I think you can just wait
until they get back.

96
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,130
--Up a little, maybe?
--Yeah.

97
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,010
Can I help with anything?

98
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,680
S-Soma-sempai!

99
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,100
N-No, don't be silly!

100
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,680
W-We couldn't ask
the president to help us!

101
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,190
--Help?
--We couldn't ask you to do that, Yuki.

102
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,980
No, no need.

103
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:49,190
We know you're already busy
with other stuff, Soma.

104
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:58,370
They really don't need to be so polite...

105
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,670
That looks like fun.

106
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,930
Machi?

107
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:26,440
You startled me.
What's got you running so fast?

108
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,440
--When you...
--What?

109
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,240
When you roam around
in such strange patterns,

110
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,280
I can't predict your route and I lose you.

111
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,620
Oh, were you looking for me?

112
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,580
Sorry. Did you want me for something?

113
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,700
No.

114
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,660
Okay, hold it.

115
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:47,130
You ran around looking for me till you
were out of breath for no reason?

116
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,920
I did want something.

117
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,340
Which is it?

118
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,220
T-To say hello.

119
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:59,470
I saw you, so I just...
thought I'd say hello.

120
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:03,810
But you kept roaming
on an unpredictable route...

121
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,770
Please say "patrolling."

122
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:10,440
Anyway! I just got stubborn because
you were hard to catch, that's all.

123
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,070
Okay...

124
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:17,030
It's not like she couldn't say hello
when she saw me again later.

125
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:21,990
She chased me just for that?

126
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,870
She came to me, of all people?

127
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,010
Thank you.

128
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,130
Ow!

129
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:40,850
What did I do to deserve that?
And what is this?

130
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,220
--A flower.
--What? No way. Really?

131
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,440
It's even worse than the ones I made.

132
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,400
It's a flower!

133
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,440
They're taking forever.

134
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,860
Maybe their investigation got bogged down?

135
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,450
I bet they got distracted
by something more fun.

136
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,780
They seem like they only live
for the moment.

137
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,790
I-I don't think so...

138
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:12,130
My curse has already broken.

139
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,260
Kyo-kun...

140
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:26,520
What would you think if there
were someone in the zodiac

141
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,690
whose curse was broken?

142
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,690
Huh?

143
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,400
What do you mean?
There's no way for me to know that.

144
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,490
Don't ask me hypothetical questions
about stuff like that.

145
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,960
O-Oi! Why are you depressed now?!

146
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,960
I-I'm sorry. That was thoughtless of me.

147
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,010
Whoa, whoa, don't apologize.
I'm not mad, I swear!

148
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:59,430
--What should I do?
--Was it my phrasing?
Is that it?!

149
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,300
--What should I do?
--Look, I'm sorry.
I should've said that better.

150
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,350
--I don't want to upset him.
--Look, I'm sorry.
I should've said that better.

151
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,140
I can't raise my head.

152
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,020
I'm afraid I'll cry.

153
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,080
We arrested the culprits.

154
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,880
But I'm tired now.

155
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,710
Let's go home, Tohru-kun.

156
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:39,510
What on earth happened?

157
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,840
We caught the perps, but...

158
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,300
We just ordered them to make
replacement flowers.

159
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,020
They're lucky we didn't
confiscate what they took.

160
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,060
Our punishment was humane.

161
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,400
How are you today?

162
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,480
This is a little present.

163
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,150
I thought you might not
have seen one, Akito-san.

164
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:08,830
Hey. Do you still remember?

165
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,870
Remember what?

166
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,880
Isuzu-san!

167
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,550
"Isuzu"? What, is something up with Rin?

168
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:30,890
Oh, um, it's nothing!
My mind was wandering!

169
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:33,270
Okay...

170
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:38,940
I can't believe I forgot about
Isuzu-san until just now.

171
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,530
She's desperate to break the curse, too.

172
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:49,030
I'm sorry. Should I tell you, Isuzu-san?

173
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:55,370
Come to think of it, I don't think
I've seen her since... New Year's...

174
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,920
Shigure says he'll be out late.

175
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,420
Late? Isn't he having dinner
with his editor today?

176
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,130
Taking his time torturing her, probably.

177
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,350
I'll go visit her.

178
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,390
I'll just go--

179
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,180
Please come!

180
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,480
Please just come save me!

181
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,900
I think I've tried really hard,

182
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:22,650
and I'm not sure I can make it
home tonight psychologically intact!

183
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:27,570
Mitchan, you're too sensitive.
And you're Soma-sensei's editor!

184
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:31,450
That seems like a problem.
Shouldn't we call the manager?

185
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:35,290
Let's give her some space.
Life can be hard.

186
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,750
Did you know the devil pretends to be
a wanderer before he gets in the boat?

187
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,000
What?

188
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,130
Anyway, this is a business
relations thing, so no running away.

189
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,220
Maybe I'll quit my job.

190
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,310
There's my companion, so I'm off.

191
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,560
Stop, Shigure! Pay your respects
to Akito-san first.

192
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,440
I don't want to.
It's bound to take forever.

193
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,480
Shall we?

194
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,490
Um, if you know those people,
why not go for a drink with them next?

195
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:10,740
You must be kidding. What fun
would it be to drink with my parents?

196
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,120
P-P-Parents?!

197
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,580
Sorry, I'm afraid I do have parents.

198
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,710
I-I want to get a closer look at them!

199
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:23,090
Don't bother. They'll just
turn any outsiders away.

200
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:27,880
Apparently, there's a dinner tonight
for the main family's chosen guests.

201
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,640
You picked the worst restaurant, Mitchan.

202
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:36,930
"Main family"...
The Somas must be real elites, huh?

203
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:41,900
True. There's serious status gap
between you and Ritchan.

204
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:46,490
Oh, look, the honored family head arrives.

205
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,860
Mm-hmm...

206
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,160
Pale as a ghost, am I right?

207
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,200
Mm-hmm...

208
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,870
I mean, no! I was only thinking
that he looks so young!

209
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,080
Not too young. Over 20, I think.

210
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,040
E-Excuse me?! Are you saying people
over 20 aren't young anymore?!

211
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,960
He's young and pretty!

212
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,800
Although I guess it might be rude
to call a man "pretty"...

213
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,560
So, where shall we drink next?

214
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,060
--What? Sensei!
No weird places, please, okay?!

215
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,230
--I did tell him to pay his respects.
--What? Sensei!
No weird places, please, okay?!

216
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,150
Shall I go after him?

217
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,770
No need.

218
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,110
Come, Kureno.

219
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,610
Don't you think you
should've abandoned Akito-san?

220
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:38,540
For Akito-san's sake...
back then and this time, too?

221
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,250
You don't seem too surprised.

222
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:47,090
Did you already figure out
I was free from the curse?

223
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:51,180
I wish I could say yes and sound cool,

224
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,640
but I'm afraid it was just a hunch.

225
00:15:54,640 --> 00:16:01,640
But I feel a little better now.
I see how it is...

226
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,110
No wonder she wants to keep you close.

227
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:10,610
She wouldn't want people to find out,
and she'd be saddeningly desperate.

228
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:16,120
Shigure-niisan... I believe I know
how you feel about her.

229
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,740
And that you hate me. But--

230
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:25,250
Yes, I do hate you. I hate you a lot.

231
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,710
Better thank me for making that clear.

232
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:33,090
Now you can enjoy that gloomy act
of yours all you want.

233
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,800
How nice for you.

234
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,430
Niisan...

235
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:39,850
Still, I want to ask you
not to cut off Akito.

236
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:44,140
Please don't be any colder with her.

237
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:48,110
She doesn't keep me close
because she loves me.

238
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:53,950
The one she wants with
her most has always been...

239
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,200
"Soma"

240
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,370
Welcome home.

241
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,160
Welcome home.

242
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,410
Welcome home, Akito-san.

243
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,710
You can stay here. Everyone keep away.

244
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,960
Of course.

245
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,390
Welcome home.

246
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:27,190
Did you have fun dining with everyone?

247
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:35,030
That outfit makes you
look even more masculine.

248
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,570
Why did you come? What do you want?

249
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,830
To apologize for not
greeting you at the restaurant.

250
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:45,410
Who was that woman with you?

251
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:49,170
Someone from work.

252
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,540
Slept with her yet?

253
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,260
That's harsh.

254
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:59,260
Wow. I thought you slept with
every woman you knew.

255
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,560
You're being absurd.

256
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,020
You slept with that woman, though.

257
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:09,230
Which woman would that be?

258
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,270
Ren!

259
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:15,690
How dare you... How dare you
sleep with someone like her?!

260
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,360
That was a long time ago.

261
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,870
You've already punished me
for it, too. You told me to leave.

262
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:27,370
You know I wouldn't live
in that house otherwise.

263
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:32,340
Yeah, right! You waltzed out of here
without even putting up a fight!

264
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:38,970
You wanted to go from the beginning!
You wanted to get away from here!

265
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:41,260
And from me!

266
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:45,100
That's why you slept with... with her...

267
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:53,070
Shigure, you like her more...
you want her...!

268
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,280
I care about you more than anyone.

269
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,370
That's an unwavering truth.

270
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,750
I... thought you forgot.

271
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,250
I never said I forgot.

272
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,830
Is that why you've been so irritable?

273
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:17,130
Why do you test me like that?!

274
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,090
I'm not testing you.

275
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,090
Don't you get it?

276
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:28,230
I only slept with her
because you slept with Kureno.

277
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,560
What the hell...?

278
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,150
What the hell?!

279
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,610
So it's my fault?!
I didn't do anything wrong!

280
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:38,110
Don't blame me!

281
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,200
Don't get the wrong idea, Kureno.

282
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,950
I love Akito.

283
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:51,460
I always have. I love her so much...

284
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,960
...that sometimes I want
to spoil her rotten...

285
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,130
I'm special!

286
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:01,800
The zodiac members are mine,
and I can do whatever I want with them!

287
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,220
It's my right!

288
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:08,180
...and sometimes I want
to crush her to a pulp.

289
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:14,020
If you don't get it, then let's not
talk about this anymore.

290
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:18,570
We're just repeating the same
discussion we always have.

291
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:25,240
Your mood is only getting worse.
I should go.

292
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:43,680
You deny your womanhood,
but you're always ready...

293
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,390
...to use it against me.

294
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,480
It's here.

295
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,810
Eternity is here.

296
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,360
I'm always thinking about you.

297
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,950
I missed you, before.

298
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:08,780
I'm here forever.

299
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,450
You just haven't noticed.

300
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,670
I was waiting that day...

301
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,040
...and I never stopped.

302
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,050
Isuzu Soma?

303
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,050
Yeah, she's in our class.

304
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,220
But she's on one of
her absent kicks again.

305
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,350
What?

306
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:33,480
I forget--is she in the hospital again?

307
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,140
Isn't she recuperating?

308
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,270
Oh, right! Someplace far away or whatever.

309
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,650
Your mind is a sieve.

310
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:44,950
I see... Thank you.

311
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,660
I don't see how Soma-san
can graduate on time.

312
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,290
Her family'll pay off the school.

313
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:54,750
So, do you think that girl
is Soma-san's friend?

314
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,790
She has friends?! No way!

315
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,750
You're so mean!

316
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:04,300
I've been waiting.

317
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,930
All this time...

318
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:14,060
...I've been right here waiting for you.

319
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:51,550
